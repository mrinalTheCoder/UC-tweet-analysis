Amazing
Worst services . They re schedule to what ever date they like and they also cancel amount for the re schedule . One of the very worst unprofessional services .
Worst service
Very Very Horrible Experience on very 1st service. MR. A C BHAL( Basically ekta Baal) is an owner of cheater company. He thinks people in 2022 are Gandu. Be honest with your customer MR. BHAL.
Good
Wrost first experience and services no foam available at service engineer for ac cleaning. Cancel my booking without my permission
I was highly dissatisfied with my last service of water purifier and discussed the issue with customer service after it reoccurred within 20 days of the agent's visit, now they are demanding again to pay INR 348 for a task which they should have done on the first visit itself. Furthermore, I was surprised to find out they applied a safety charge of 48/- without being able to define the purpose. Literally UC is behaving like a roadside pocket picker. My perception of UC as a company is changed completely.
This company was very good . But in patna their services are very poor All unprofessional was working , please don't use this in patna . Mainly in Air conditioner service Please don't call them in patna . Call brand service centre .
Terrible experience, after serving my ac start throwing water. Even after scheduling revisit there technician has not arrived. After 24 hours of writing this review they reached me and solved my complaint. Thanks a lot.
Employees are fraud . Very recently we had asked for bathroom cleaner . The person visited us and manipulated my parents , who aren't much used to these things , to cancel the booking and took the money . He destroyed our bathroom tiles . When we complained he denied that he even visited our house . Urban clap squeezed out their way because of technicalities, but I would like to tell people that the Employees are fraud trying to con money and who knows what bad intentions they might have .
I've got a best person to fit my AC in my room, best ever , thanks to Zeeshan
Not satisfied with the service üôè
exceptional experts and services
Not at all responding
No person come on scheduled time and my booking amount has not been fully refunded.
Very bad service tecanision make fool custumer new barand mother bord change old and rejected mother bord and charge 4500 +298 . And take time 3day .my tv mother bord repring and charge me 4500 and make bill adgusment amount . No manstion new motherboard amount 4500.so u can not get warranty if any problem. In 60 day . Ple dont make fool customer otherwise no body call uc . Ple dont call UCcall product company .the also charge but original part giving u and warranty..
There is one problem with app. Today one technician visited to attend my call and after checking refused to complete the job, canceled my order and went. Now I want to write a review of that technician but there is no option in the app to write the review. I hope the developer will consider it to make the app more transparent for customers.
The app has become worse, previously it used to be user friendly, going to uninstall
Worst experience ever. I canceled my manicure appointment and haven't received the refund of 398 yet. Very poor services....the servicemen keep telling its done.
First you only can select slot after 1 to 2 days, than you wait for professional and at appointment time call come from call centre that professional is not available and all your time management goes for a toss
great cleaning and cover full area
Ekdam faltu app. Samay ki barbadi bus.
Nice
They cleaning services are good and neat...we liked this urban company üëç
Book your work through UC ,best option in new places
good job
Took its AC services quite recently for the first time. Quite satisfied. Hope they keep it up.
It was excellent
Very Poor service They don't provide the professional at scheduled time and don't reply back
Worst service and worstcustomer care experience ...
Bad service
but the rating options are not displayed on the screen completely. I couldn't see what remark I was choosing.
I don't even feel like giving one star to urban clap. It is ridiculous. Their salon services is degraded. No changes. May be they got too confident. This is 3rd time with me that the salon services is ridiculous. The services always go on hold. They are no professional services assigned every time. Alst time they were not able to refund to my account. They credited to uc cash. Even after that I'm not able to use services. There are no agent responding properly. No one responds properly.
Good service
Best Service at Home
Worst and unprofessional experience, booked the service and got no response even after 45 min passed the booked time
Great services
Poor customer service
Pathetic Service.
Worst experience, charging unnecessary more , company is charging two additional prices for same components. Company should charge in ethical manner,
excellent service
Not even deserve 1 star. 3 times they rescheduled the timing for ac repair and failed every time to deliver the service and the worst part is every time they say we take this very seriously. Lastly I have to cancel my request after 2 days of struggle. Pathetic service. Worst service I have experienced by any company till date
super
good service
So i orderd the famous foamjet service and the service guy calls me and says, please cancel the order, i accepted the service by mistake, so i said why don't u cancel it? He didnt He was supposed to arrive at 3pm It 4.46 pm now And no one has arrived Neither is he picking up the phone Very bad experience It would be better if you just get your ac serviced from your local ac guy or the authorised dealer
App shows incorrect information about UC warranty to fool users. I have screenshots to prove that my warranty is for 90 days, whereas the Customer care tells me that it is only for 60 days.
Bad , solution, as I booked a slot for repair AC but in UC not attend a Tech and nor informed as they will attend or not, time elapsed two days, no any person haven't attend. After lot of logs given to UC they told can we reschedule your slot, not a manner to this kind of solutions.
good
Seems the company is not able to cope up to the demand, this may be the starting point of the downfall. Also, the customer care is getting bad to worse. Had booked a professional and at the scheduled time customer care calls and says you can cancel.
Booked salon service for my wife. She got allergic reaction because of the poor quality products. Don't use urban company
Good service.
Very polite and prompt service.Just loved it. Highly recommended
The technician damaged my AC on 27.03.2022. Now today is 13.04.2022 and living without AC. They are not responding email nor they contacted me. Worst experience with UC.
Service price is too costly, waste of money. Don't download this useless app.
Easy to use, Very Professional in their services Totally Satisfied.
Repeated reshedules . Not able to assign professionals
Waste
superb service. fully satisfied.
Cleaning is not up to mark. They charge alot and the finishing is not at all of that cost
Options for beauty services are good
If I have the option to give negative feedback, then this value will be -5, Fraud done by Technician and there is no any way to connect with Customer care. Only they can connect when they want..
Good service offered
You rate yourself basis the following feedback on your business policies: The scheduled service which has now been cancelled (because of your technician's unethical and unprofessional behaviour) was priced Rs. 398. You processed the refund which was duly received by me. On being advised to rebook the service, the price is now Rs. 599. Now, what kind of opportunistic policies are these???
Service was excellent.
you can still lower the rates or add 1 more service in package
I am not able to download the app
Worst...bcz i suffer a lot buy choosing this app..i complaint lot of time but there is no response from company
Great service and affordable price.. Thanks UC !
I m happy with service but why service assistant ask for personal servicing for less amount as he charged me 1800instead 2500 as 700 goes as his commission only and he got full 1800‚Çπin his own pocket Please hire your own professionals instead of dependent on locals service assistant thanks for great service but sorry for your loss
Very Good
The worst experience. My appointment is cancelled and reschedule done without informing me at timings that is not suitable for me . Worst professional service
Worst experience Unprofessional work Not refunding money
the technician was of great help.
The most irritating unprofessional and useless App.. Not at all user friendly
Trus worthy...
outdoor unit pr aap log foam nahi lgate , kripya lagvaiye , kyonki outdoor unit ka filter kafi ganda hota hai
Worst customer experience. It's on customer to check why the request is not assigned with the executive and do multiple follow-ups to get them assigned. Happened twice for me and they keep on rescheduling the request. After the lockdown the service became worst from Urban Company.
Very bad experience. Charged with excess money , when called customer care there was no proper response.
yes can try
It is very versatile waste app . I should really say it is bad I don't think to download this app better we can download other best apps . My problem is not that my problem is when I booked Salon it didn't came after 2,3 days it came I canceled it . It is really a very very waste and bad app.
Always a terrible experience. Almost everytime i need an urgent help, urban clap fails to help me.. earlier i never received the OTP, then it used to say my area is not serviceable and now it keeps saying there are no slots for people to help. Utterly disappointed as always. I'm uninstalling and never coming back
Worst looting money irrespective of service
excellent
Good service
This is best platform... And good service all kind of proffettional ...and everyone proffettional give a good vihevier and polite people is the industry.....urban company is the number one platform in the word...and respected platform....
Professional services provider
good experience
Not happy with the service. Stains are still there. Also the person who referred me also did not get his reward. So he also feels cheated.
Extremely expensive services.. ac service is costing 750 rupess, whereas normal market rate is around 400 rupees.. no point of using this application. ü§¨
good
Not yet experienced, just booked
Waiting from long time still jabalpur isn't serviceable ... jabalpur is major city of india and Madhya Pradesh specially but still not serviceable its not good please start services in jabalpur as well
Good
Good service
I have done two time bkg for same problem n they r charge both time one is on 10th March n another is on 11th april very poor n greedy service don't trust on this co
This is the second time I opted for Urban Clap, and they are the best
Very Good
Best serves it help me a lot
Once they damaged my washing maching. Second time they damaged my Fridge. Even their rates are increased. Please don't use this app
Didn't receive any call from customers care..waiting since past 1 month to resolve issue..
Great app with well designed service options and prompt as well professional services.
I a Sr citizen widow had called for a paint estimate and same was approved by me paid 35 % and the work was to start on Monday 11th April 2022 3 person came and said we have not brought the material and said we will come tomorrow no response from him and responded to Urban companythrough there regular computerized queries no response from them . Urban Company once responded we are working bloody hell you are working from 11th April today is 14th April 2022.I just want my refund immediately üò•üò°
UC had to improve its service because when I am selecting the cod option it is not working I am very angry with this glitches. My humble request is to software professionals of uc to solve this glitches
Worst AC service.. These people have damaged 2 of my ACs.. Unprofessional company.. No reply against complaints.. Pls don't book these cheats Edit on 10-04-2022 Gandi company ne aaj tak ek AC thik nahi kara.. 3-4 din me fone karte hain bolne k liye ki aaj ho jaega Edit on 12-04-2022 twice mail has been sent.. No response yet from this useless company. Update on 14-04-2022 - No resolution from the useless company yet. New service person is assigned. Who is also useless.. Making false claims..
Pathetic app. Everytime it keeps showing slot not available Are you saying that slots not available since last 72 hours‚Ä¶ stop giving standard scripts in reply‚Ä¶. Better u guys accept the fact since bookings are low, so you don‚Äôt serve in certain locations or you don‚Äôt have feet on street resources..
I strongly recommends urbon company
The services are never provided as promised. They take advance payment, and then don't deliver the promised deliverable. For example, I had booked a service for 12pm today, and they still haven't assigned anyone, and like the last 4 times - they will probably cancel and ask me to either reschedule or request a refund. Not reliable at all.
Urban clap doesn't care about punctuality and time bound work. Your request and appointment can last unattended for several days. I will never ever trust again UC.
Worst experience ever.. they keep on cancelling your service and then process your refund without informing you. I don't know what is the status of my refund. I am trying to contact the customer service but not getting any call back. They just keep on giving you time slot for a call back..v
Third class company..
Top class service.
Best services
Bad service.. fooling customers Would love to see everyone giving one star rating ü§¨ü§¨
she is very good at her work
Poor in customer care. Don't have any customer care no or chat option in app. My money is stuck and not able to get help Very Very difficult to reach customer care. They don't have any attitude to resolve issues of app
More price. Better to go saloon personally. Why give more price than saloon. Bakwaas....
Bad device not coming in barich
Excellent
NO response on my AC part taken away by technician and UC is least bothered as no call back for 2 days. PATHETIC
Worest experience.. not recommended
Bed experience u r technician fruad nd scam me
Nice üôÇ Good üòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä
They charged full money and then PPL who comes are regular service provider while was charged for premium service and above all they don't have proper knowledge.and to add salt to wound when I tried complaint customare care team is so bad .just struggling to solve my issue
Poor Service given and no engineer is coming on time alloted to him and have courtesy to inform. Free Revisits are just a scam no one contacts for the same
Very bad
They keep rescheduling the booking, could not arrange a technician to install a Geyser
The professional was a cheat n he charged me for cheating!! UC is supporting the guy!!
The review is for the the management, if your appointed staff is busy it should be your task to replace them, you should have system to manage the staffs and their holidays/busy hours. Also why can't we book slot for the same day? We have to predecide if we want the services for the next day
The app always showing Sorry try again if want to connect with them ,The Need Help section itself require HELP from the developers.No where it's mentioned. You will be lucky if the technician( i saved number) agrees to revisit. But if u try with the website ,it is easy to get the help atleast. So app is not worthy.
Not good
First experience has been pathetic. No helpline number available. No call back happen. Payments asked in advance and no clue of services or Urban Company. This is first and last time I am using this app and it's services.
good service
The UI is worst.
Sucha a fraud company this is. I booked for a service and also added plus membership with it and the scheduled the service. They rescheduled my booking several times giving silly reasons and at last day when I asked for refund, they only refunded partial amount. I don't have that much time to go to consumer court but I pray to god that this company loose all the trust of their customers and fail in near future.
Poor experience. Issue still unresolved after 3 visits. Technician not able to understand simple issue and resolve. Customer care team is irresponsible and non responsive. Wish I could give less than 1star
Good service. Bot service cost is little high.
Nice experience üôÇ
awesome experience
Pathetic
I engaged a A/C mechanic for some repair work to my A/C.in the last week of March2022 through Urban company services by seeing this kind of advertisement. But that fellow came and pretending as if he was doing some repair work and received ,Rs.4000/- from me. But even that day itself we found that he did not do any repair work. When we tried to contact him he never turned up. The company also did not take any responsibility. This is my personal bitter experience.
Very proffesional and thank you for coming in udaipur
Thorough professional and well behaved technician. One can use the service as per their convenience
Very bad experience with professional and company also.
Always good. üëç
Once I get cleaned my sofa set
Very good service üëçüëç
Worst company! Simply FALTOOO!
Amazing
Not up to expectation. The service is really bad. Left out with a faulty AC unit and a dirty, messed up house
I have had an amazing experience with all the professionals in all the departments
I m an assistant professor
i have problem with company,why don't you have customer care number,mera washing machine ka part leke gya hai professional koi bhi rply nhi de raha ,na company aur na professional..very bad experience 15 mail ker chuki hu 14march 2022 se 08-April -2022 washing machine ka pcb leke gya hai kab lake dega tumhara professional.. aaj pure ek mahina ho gya hai,where is my machines pcb.
Very pathetic service provided by agents and they will charge you double from market price. I opted for service for my ac and agent told that we will have to get ac repaired by them at double cost from market otherwise no service will be done plus they also charged convince fee for doing absolutely nothing not even service.one more thing they are advertising for their foam jet technology but agent was denying for doing so. Don't fall in their advertisement trap.
Very difficult to claim warranty
None of the referral codes work and the app is hanging a lot. IT SUCKS
really good work done in reasonable cost
best service Provider excellent
Unnecessary change against orders
Gets the job done
Step1- money transaction need in 7 seconds before understand the problem, Step2- Now understood problem, no solution & money will be refund after 7days. Step3- Remember step 2
I made the booking two days prior and then I had to wait three hours with customer service before they informed me that the service was cancelled and they put me on hold for 20 minutes.
bad refund policy
Good
Good technician n excellent service
Wastage of money
Getting services at our door step very easily and promptly.
hardworking person and excellent worküíØüëç
We had a bad experience with our ac servicing. AC stopped working after the service and the so called insurance is useless and they won't claim anything even though it's their agents fault. And the coustomer service just speaks what they want to and hang up on you.
good service
Varanasi main sigra par aakpi company free service de rahi hai main gyi thi waha aapke staff itne jaayda batmeez thi Ritu Aanchal woh log customer ko service Dene ke baad Galli dete hai aur maine next day ek aur ladki ko bheja usse mujhe gali de Rahi thi Ritu aur kuch bhi karne nhi aata ushko mera hand bhi burn kar diya ushne
not responding after service
One of the worst AC service company. I booked 2 window AC service from the app. They sent an unprofessional person After servicing both AC he said in one AC gas has leaked. But AC was working fine before service so how can gas leak. My guess may be the unprofessional person sent by Urban Company had done something while servicing and gas got leaked to earn some extra money. Hate such people and such company who employ such people who just want to earn more money on others expense Unprofessionals
Worst service.......Giving us slot and they will not arrange a professional and simply say sorry......I will not recommend this to any one
Fraud company first they charge the extra amount showing its 2200 and when I paidnit deducted 2450 from my account don't know how then there is no way to contact them raised a complaint they said will refund the amount in 7 days more than 2 weeks now and nothing happens and there is no way to speak with some one on urban company beware before using this app and making payment online
Very bad company
Worst services.. Services engineer never want to service always trying to avoid service and suggest us to sell... On behalf of getting it repaired.... I got repaired with local person it's working 10000% fine..
Very good
Very Bad experience! I had booked service but the professional didn't came at all. I had wait for nearly 5 hours after my appointment but she didn't came and not pick my single call. When there customer care tried to reach her she didn't receive there call also. This is not a professional behavior. You should respect other's time too. Customer care also is not very good and not helpful at all only higher official are good I had already contacted your customer care so don't tell me to contact now
Very Good service from Urban Company and team is really good and very polite.
Your professionals doesn't even bother to arrive or answer calls. This has happened to me twice. Customer care professionals only have 1 answer "Sorry".
Service usually is good .. Thanks UC...
I get my AC unit deep clean service. After service it's cooling is getting decreased. So i called for urban revisit. But due to unavailability of the slot I was unable to get service person. So i get it checked from another professional found its indoor unit coil is and tray is damaged due to high jet pressure. I contacted urban but no response from thier end. Terrible experience.
Very dangerous company...it's an official thieves company. I think Urban company is sending for stealing and earning more than services. If we complain, something is stolen by urban company person, we don't get our item back or paid for that and no action on that person aswell.
Good service
my experience was very good. definitely recommend üëç
Good
very polite person with a professional skills
Good and user friendly app
Amazing
Unethical customer care. Cheats consumer over refund.
Don't buy Appliance protection plan. No contact number to connect. Taking APP is headace
Hired their helper for my house cleaning. It was a pleasant and fuss free experience. Their helper was punctual and very good. I highly recommend the app and company.
The service is good , but the costumer care reachibilty is only through mail . should be also should phone.
What a waste and rip off. Arrived late. Then spent 8 hours doing g practically nothing, and then wanted to charge me extra. Most of the day one guy did some work. I have a small apartment and they couldn't handle it.wont book this again.
well experienced technician..
good service
I am not able to see any option for cash payment in the App. Can this issue be resolved.
While the app has slightly confusing UI, the major problem I faced is, professional could cancel even at last moment and leave customer with no options even after reaching helpdesk. Why show slots if professionals aren't available. Situation reversed, there's cancellation charge if customer cancels, it makes sense, but can't just penalize one side.
good work UC kampani nourat mal
There is no information about, how to contact with urban clap
Refers only good people and train them well. satisfied with several UC services...
It's was excellent
Worst company customer ko bewkhoof bana rahe hai inke executive ke paas koi bhi jawab nahi hai agar minis mein star hote tho mein woh deta . customer ka kitna bhi nuksan ho inki service use karne par , par yeh kuch bhi cover nahi karte hai .Mera yeh manna hai ki is company se koi fyada nahi hai customer ko . boycott worst company
Very worst
No way to contact the company over issues with their services!
Urban company gives the best service.
way too expensive as compared to local people providing the same services.. it is good for people who don't really care about the price and wants to get things done on demand.
VERY GOOD
I am always satisfied with their services. Hassel free solutions
Completely useless service , cheaters themselves only cancel the request
Good service
UC is worse than the local karagirs. They have listed a service which none of their partner service providers can execute, they refuse, then expect customers to cancel booking and pay cancelation charges. Customer service is worse, they don't want to listen to customer and are biased towards their partners. Book only if you want to end up getting frustrated! Unfortunately I have paid for the 'Plus' membership, absolute waste of money and time.
good
Worst application I have ever seen. I booked professional for pest control. But what they did was just for show. I tried to contact them many time but in vain. My aprox 1600rs was waisted. I will never recommend anyone for this app.
The technician are unskilled They damage my AC Company help center delay the issue No one can hear our problems Technician missguide and want to get more money to show big problem. Urban company bilkul bekar hai Jiske technician usse technician pagal banate hain bevkuf banate hain Apna Commission Jyada banane ke liye customer ko galat galat Salah Dete Hain is app Se Kabhi Bhi Koi Bhi service Mal hai
Good
UC charged me for the service that was never delivered. It felt like they are to loot on the name of fake commitments...
Pathetic service
Worst service. They take the booking and donot provide any service. 2 consecutive days I have booked for the service but they are not able to assign nay professional. One time they assigned someone but that person didnot come and didnot pick my call too. Try to keep some professionals who knows the value of time or work.
Poor Services
Local language not support and they are not interusted support Local language but they business Locally
5 year
good experience
Monthly recharge and uc credit and uc charge and uc Tex what my income your company
Second time my experience with Uc professionals regarding a.c. services is really good and satisfactory.
Superb
good
Very Satisfied Service
Quick, fast and good services. Fully satisfied.
Very less quantity of foam used rest of the servicing was good
Horrible experience. Assigned unprofessional agent who is so rude and not submitted the proper bill for the part. In Invoice copy also part replaced was not mentioned and warranty is not applicable... Don't know how to reach customer service team...Need Assistance on this immediately.
Satisfied with services...but having issue while payment...so please make online payment more flexible with coupons so that it's flexible on wallet...Overall Best.
de tan experience is not good at all priceses are high...
Good app
Ac service is very bad.
Had tried to book a carpenter few months ago and today as well but no partners assigned even after a few days of booking date. Cannot depend on urbanclap for future services.
good
Third class service
AC professional came to solve water leakage issue and he confirmed that leakage won't occur. After he left, leakage started and even more. When I reached customer care, they initially confirmed they will check and revert with the solution. After a day, I did the followup and they ensured that they will arrange for revisit, later they said it cannot be arranged due to the sum of money I paid. Much disappointment and my mistake was I took yearly plus package too. Services are not reliable.
The video consultation service is permanently closed or it will start soon
Excellent service
Very very poor customer experience platform. Please don't use this platform they have four time reschedule the service and now they are saying cancel your booking they don't have the service person for a complete week they have Suck my energy....stop doing marketing First work on customer experience Zero review from my side... Will make sure no one from my close one will use this platform üëé
beautician was not assigned at all .
Terrible booking experience as they have charged me for service not being done.
No one turns up for any of the request even after many follow ups
Excellent M
AC service is very disappointing. Professionals are actually amateurs who screw up your ac more than getting it work properly
Very unprofessional people.. They changed the assigned professional on their own without any prior information. Very disappointing. I would refrain from taking any further services from UC
good
Painting job done nicely. Happy with the neat and nice work.
My first booking for a AC Cleaning was booked, but the technician rejected even after seeing the possibilities of cleaning anyone among 3 ACs.. He also said some SME from UC will call, it's been more than 2 weeks NO calls.. I uninstalled UC app and decided not to use. However, i thought to try Intense bathroom service and it worked, but my intention of booking is to remove salt scale in the floor, but resulting in small improvement only..
User friendly app
Uc not turusted company not responsible
UC as company , is only hipe created in the market.. they took more then 24 hrs to allocate engineers on the service that to be when i chased them after my booked slot... they even bothered to inform me for delay. 1st impression is last impression :).
Great service
Awesome service
too good satisfied with their job
Worst Professional Service. Wasted a whole day of work of mine. Gave a booking and kept on resheduling on thr bases. Atlast giving a service date after three days. Local are better than UC atleast they come on time.
Love it... get service at home without any mess so truly I believe Urban Company üëçüëç
We have had great experiences with this app so far but I had a few suggestions to make: 1. Cook- It would be great if you could provide a cook too. Sometimes for parties and events, cooks are required for a day. 2. Drivers- Sometimes we require a professional driver for a few days or to drop kids to school. 3. Please have a feedback/suggestion option inside the app as well.
Very convenient and customised
High cost
check the people you hire, some of them are awesome...but some of them are really bad.
It's totally money & time waste....
Superb app, wonderful service
Ac deep cleaning had been done in best way and my ac is working like a brand new one again, Thanks to Urban company.
Amazing app and services
Not as expected after this experience I never book urban company for AC service.
Salon services are good ac service is the worst and the customer care executive is just capable of saying reschedule it to tomorrow nothing else if they don't have a service provider then y show the slot why ask the customer to wait till afternoon and then reschedule worst experience i have been waiting for two days and cancelled after they wanted me to reschedule the service for the third day .if u can't understand the customers worries then pls quit being a service providerhighly disappointed
Uninstalling though I just paid for plus services. They don't give plus discount for adhoc services which is through their company only but they would give discount if i booked again? What logic is this?
Highly unprofessional service dont buy there subscription company is a scam they don't have professionals keep on rescheduling and then cancel it less than 1 star should be there, no way to contact there supervisor
I have made a booking for hair cutting dated 13.04.2022 on 7:00 Hrs. but after the professional assigned. professional was told me " ‡§Æ‡•à ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä ‡§Ü ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡§æ, ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç‡§ï‡§ø ‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡§æ ‡§π‡§¨ ‡§®‡•ã‡§è‡§°‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§ ‡§Ü‡§™ ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§¨‡•Å‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ï‡•à‡§®‡•ç‡§∏‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§¶‡•ã" and my booking is automatically cancelled and message is shown in Urban Clap App is your refund is under process.
My present experience has been very poor, unpleasant & unmemorable. Expect more efficiency from UC services.
Good job done
They have good set of people who provides services but that's limited in number.they take money before completion of the work and then you can keep waiting for the work to get finish. My Suggestion: Don't pay them 100% in advance,sothat they can be on the toe and finish up your job on time and then you can release the payment.
Cheater Company don't trust. While booking in the beginning charges will show less but while final booking automatically charges become higher.
Now it has just became more pricy compare to other sites they who are providing the service with that urban clap has no good service providers...
I'm not able to download the app since long time. Kindly resolve this issue asap
Pathetic service provided especially by the beauticians. They cancel the services anytime they wish , even without informing the customers. This has happened many times with me. I just don't understand if services are booked 2 days prior, how can they cancel it just before the time of service Without providing any alternatives for the same time. This post is only about the beauticians. I have availed the services of their electricians and plumbers, which were quite good.
Frustrating
professional service people, prompt service, value for money too ! from home cleaning to full body massage to AC servicing, completely trust and endorse Urban Company !
He was Superb, Excellent üëçüëç
Customer support is pathetic, i am waiting for more than a month now for my ac service, and no one came and i am unable to call customer care as they never call back. Don't pay them in advance.
too costly might prohibit using their services again. very prompt n attentive
UC need less money there work is to good and do his job very perfectly.
No contact number is available to raise my grievance
Worst service i have ever seen before.. I booked for deep cleaning of my airconditioner on Saturday for monday at 10 am & paid 649 rs for that services bt no one has came on Monday & nor getting any information about that..
My experience was very bad I booked full house cleaning as was relocating. The service people came late then kept us waiting for very long time and then left without providing any reason and cancelled the booking and I was also not provided backup service team to clean the house.
Superb quality of work done by the team, would highly recommend it.
Chor company
It was excellent üëç
got my massage with Pawan Kumar & it was great!
good service
Good Application
UC booked my appointment and i had done my payment before get service, but only before 15 minutes of my scheduled appointment, they told me that we are not able to assign anyone for your job. Pathetic and very unprofessional behaviour.
Most of the time I have opted for urban company and the payment has failed. Money gets deducted however no technician gets assigned. Yes the money does get refunded within 5 to 7 days however the experience is pathetic. Also I took a membership, the charges for repair show as 119 and with membership i get 19 rs discount however the convenience fee gets added by 39 rs and minimum order fee of 60 rs (a total of 99 rs) taking the total to 200 rs. It shows 100 but you actually land up paying 200.
Don't see the stupid adds n u ll end up talking to customer service daily n nothing of ur work will be done .Will never opt out for the service again and i would surely refer my experience with your guys .worst service in banglore . They will just reschedule as they want for days n days . Don't appoint one good professional. The people who work for this company itself say that they will do fir half of price n don't get it done by UC. Such an awful staff and stupid technicians.
Prompt and excellent service. Highly recommended.
This is totally unprofessional company which works for the convenience of their professionals and not at all for providing service as confirmed by their booking. They not even inform or apologize for failure in compliance.
I have to shift my outdoor unit of SPLIT AC from 2nd floor to 3rd floor. There is no option. Which option i have to select?
Good first experience!
Don't download this app, horrible service and extremely rude. First they never show up on time and also they give u advice to spend more and more service charges but never actually solve your problem. Please improve and stop running this scam.
Good üëç
Opted for regular AC service and the AC was working fine before the service. AC stopped working after service. Been 5 days now and they have provided no resolution to the issue that their technician caused. Will not use this app for any service in the future. Terrible experience
Overall good service by ekta really appreciated.
Absolutely pathetic experience. Ordered an ac Inspection. The guy just told the problem & left. When I asked him & UC to repair it, they said the booking was only for inspection(it had written otherwise - they would repair too with additional costs). So I'm left with basically nothing & just a Rs.400 scam of a service. Terrible.
Not good
This company is full of thieves. They took payment in advance for a paint job which was nowhere close to what was promised. When I asked them to rectify their mistake they said and i quote "They won't do it". When I asked for a refund they first blatantly refused, then as if they were doing me a favor they later said only partial refund was possible. Now I am left with a horrible, incomplete paint job and wasted my money. Even their customer support is non-existent. By far the worst experience.
I started taking Urban's services recently.. The same booking got cancelled thrice in a row within 10 days... There is no contact number available for any customer support service.. No timely response.. No ownership of the issue.. Pathetic...
Very poor app with having quite bad service experience. My wife booked a service for waxing. They first took booking and gave assurance of service but till scheduled time, we did not get any notification from their side regarding unavailability of professional. It wasted our time, they simply said, pls suggest other time for service what about this one what passed. We requested for compensation, they simply denied. They have not kept single contact number to put queries and resolution of same.
Kota me kab start hogi iski services
Very bad service frud company they are without service taking money & parts ecchange
Worst experience. Facial of 1hr 5min was done in 40mins and on raising a complaint their customer support offers 100rs credits. What a sham. I wasted my time and money and your resolution is this. Service person has degraded over time and street side ppl are giving services as professional
the professionals were not provided with the right chemical for removing the hard water strains
good experience
Must hire more professional people know how wise
Such a pathetic support staff you guys are not up on your promises you made. There is no warranty of services done by this pathetic company. There is no support staff who is looking after it they just wait to complete you 30 days warranty period. Useless company.
Great service, prompt, within estimated cost. highly recommend.
First Experience is very satisfied. GOOD technician (Ghanshyam Chauhan) üëç
excellent service
excellent.
UC is a thief.. it basically lootting the customer.
Worst experience . Complete exploitation by UC partner. Worst Worst.
niceüëçüëè
Service is too overpriced for basic things..
not recomendation Because ac repair person not arrived in many time and you will pay fist so you are many time resedule timing and all time charges 50 rs
This a very useful app, i will give 5 stars if they had a customer service representative during the day to resolve customer issues instantaneously. Also there should be an option to update alternative mobile number incase the professional find it difficult to contact us
excellent service given by uc thanks
Worse app
Issue resolved.
Satisfied üòåü§ó
Very bad experience waiting from 5 days for my a.c. service ...
all things are great. but there is an option available in your package of painless blackhead hair removal with a pen. that is not provided to your service woman and ghus is misleading in ur app
Very bad experience ther is no contact number to contact the company and the delivery driver in jeddah is very rude the service is bad I regret dealing with this company
They ask for pre payment and their professionals don't show up at all.
Fraudulent mind to get cancellation fee. Scheduled AC service on 2 pm. No person was assigned till 1.55 pm. At 1.55 pm company called to inform no professional available, so reschedule to some other time. I told no need just cancel. Immediately they assigned one person (who won't be available at my location) and forcing me to cancel the appointment and pay the cancellation fee. Just for 50 rs cancellation fee they forced me to never use their app (at least this account) in lifetime. Cheaters!
ok
we are asked to rate or review the service partner or service immediately right after the service. We are forced to rate 5 with hesitation in front of him/her for their satisfaction. I know rating can be tweaked later, but it would be easy for users if the review or feedback page comes after a day to avoid that awkward situation in front of the partner.
Awesome services
Fraud company. chearged me for the membership without providing the services. Have been booking it for the refrigerator repair, no one has turned up from last 2 days even after the bookings. Now this fraud company is not refunding the amount. I will make sure to write my review to all the social media platforms for others awareness. I am being cheated by them. Highly dissatisfied
Pathetic service , unprofessionals
good
Worst service ever seen,professional damaged our flush tank and when i escalted the case UC executive calls me and says sorry...he says professional has denied it so im sorry for the inconvenience this the answer from UC.
Services are good but rates are too high
Unclear pricing policy.
old age and busy people deserve this service.
Pathetic services, they cancel booking themself. Even after taking Plus membership, they don't give you any preference. They don't have any solutions.
Bad experience
This app is good
The plumber service booked,:.but UC didn't assign any in the scheduled slot. Waste of..time, unhappy. This is what happened yesterday Today considering there excuses I again Booked plumber Service today 12/4/22 11 AM. Slot. But till now no response from UC. Neither Profs. Assigned/nor given any detail of why not attended to customer. I wasted my office time again dissatisfied by Uc Service. Not Serviced as per AD. I am going tofarward this petition to consumer Rdressal council Again
done
The professional took the PCB board 5 days back and also took half of the money stating to complete the work to the quickest but now he is not pick up the call most of the time else he said it might take more time not sure until when and when tried took help from UC app 2 of the escalation members called me said within 15 min they will be calling me back to update me on the status of work but none of them return a call back yet..pathetic service provided by urban company, highly unprofessional
Don't use urban service they damage my AC coil when I submit for damage amount no one given any response
I got the service before tym,so im hpy nd service is perfect
Very bad service ..They repaired our tv.its not switching on...
really a nice idea and these guys are executing it very well. now it's hard to imagine how life would be without UC when it comes to handling plumber, electrician, etc requirements in urban areas.
App crashing again and again. Says 'something broke' all the time. Reinstalled as well but now it's not allowing me to login only. Please fix the bug
Customer service people will not call you once your booking is accepted, For every service the Urban company guys who visits will ask for extra money or they will hold work so it happen to pay them for managing our day. My Bad was to trust urban company and took subscription as well so I recommend not to use this application.
very good service
nice
very much happy with the service
khb valo very good

truely professional
Excellent service.I request you to provide service at other city in Bihar specially at Bhagalpur.
üëçüëçüëç
Please employ 'professionals ' when you call them so. Had a person coming and asking even before he started the work if we will give him good ratings. When told that the ratings are based on the work, he refused to work. Also, he says app will mention anything they want, practically he will not work on all that is mentioned in the app. If the app cannot give a clear picture of what work will be carried out, the very purpose is not solved. Terrible first experience :)
Best service peovider and honest suggestion by technician...Much lower cost than if you hire from outside...
Better Service
Efficient service.
Completely Redeculous payment gateway system, my transaction got approved by Amazon pay and payment also got deducted and there customer care is saying that it's banks fault and your payment will be refunded in 5 7 days. How come there's bank involved when I'm paying through Amazon wallet. And also charge stupid fees like "minimum order fee" Which makes your total amount ‚Çπ70 plus. It's better to just find someone on google and get your work done.
Nice way of service
good
Easy to use,
really very good model of business i personally i liked this service they are providing they realy created the benchmark of non business services
My expectations regarding the service were not met! Firstly professionals were not assigned on time. So I do not get why is it expected that as a customer we need to keep up the appointments and even if we need to cancel we are required to do it 24hrs before the time of booking but from UC the service guys were not assigned even 30mins before the time. Also capping of pricing based on 2bhk/3bhk flat irrespective of carpet area seems unreasonable. On top of it, quality of service was average
Excellent work
This is a fraud company. Do not avail their sevices. I got my AC seviced from their technician till that time it was working fine. The day after his visit it stopped working and on revisit he told us that we're out of gas. Now they keep assigning revisits but the technician doesn't show up. I now have AC which needs repair and I need to pay for it myself. See you guys in consumer court.
good app fully satisfied
clean up 03 steps are not involved all... that was the negative point.. u should involve all steps.. like other outside parlor nd gives more varieties in clean up of 03 brand..
Very poor Ac Service which had done on Sunday dated 10.04.2022. He has broken my AC Gas pipe also. Give more money and get poor service. Please look into matter. It is not good for ur company. Now I called another mechanic for the same. He cleaned dust from serviced Ac as it is very old. Sorry, I am very disappointed.
good
Pest Control professional not arrived yesterday inspite of appointment. Will have to escalate this matter further
I wish If I can give negative rating. Fraud company... U can't reach them as they don't share the contact info... Worst technician, who will damage your appliances instead of repairing them. I have already share my concern on cited email address but still there is no update. Why there is so much hassle?
Good
Very poor service....technician never comes on time and when came said UC us putting substandard parts so pls use there parts which is originals but 3X in prices
Good
very useful app. services availed so far have been professional and polite. however, it would be good to have some way of contacting a helpline without a service request for enquiry about service details before a booking is confirmed
Bringing the services to your own home saves travelling time and I'm so glad urban company came uo with such services.
super service...must go for it..
worth for money cost effective and time saving.
They spoilt a fully functional AC. Water started leaking right after 30 days. When I checked for the reason the technician has not closed the indoor unit properly.. insulation was torn from the outdoor unit.. and they say 30 day period is over can't fix it. Horrible..
good
My wife is working in urban company from last 3 year but now she need help from company they are not help her shes daughter got dengue fever and she ask for loan in company. Company said no.?? I request to all partners don't work with urban company they didn't help you when you need help.?

Inexperienced technician and malfunctioned my ac. The service boy malfunctioned my ac and there is no support from your side. The guy had 0 knowledge and completly unprofessional. I had again book the service from the ac company. Thanks for such a wonderful experience.

The app is SLOW. The packages needs to be more elaborate and convincing. The professionals come to your house and try to upsell you their services.
Your service is very very poor.#$@!please don't add this ad your service is very very very poor., $@#fu k.*(((
Excellent services. Made our life way more easy. Thanks Urban Company.
Good very good Thanks urban company
happy customer
Amazing experience
Worst experience
My experience is awesome with Urban Clap

Worst service. Please don't take their AC servicing services. Please please don't take it. You will really regret after the service.
They don't have service in Kashmir. Why the hell is that?
Cheaters and looters
This company Split AC unstalation and Instalation is very costly. Total charges Rs.2150/- show
When join uc , they promise only ,your hub can provide the job only 3,5 km send lead ,but after 6 months ,all change, now lead r ,10,12,13,14 km ,all out off hub , and when we not going ,( out hub lead ) they less sending job,,and uc said they send 20 job ,so partners max attend the 15 job ,but 19, job out off hub ,why they send out hub job ,and uc send job too alllll new partner,
Great App for now
Excellent App.. Used for bathroom cleaning purpose.. Very neatly and kindly done.. Expert and professionally trained staff. Will look forward to use different types of services in future.. Thanks UC
Been having a nightmare lately trying to reach customer service.
Damaged my AC and company is unsupportive, poor customer care response, and rude technician.... Do not recommend at all. They damage your property, and then don't respond. They also fo fraud by promising 10000rs. Insurance ...
After spending 7 month no result wasting of time and money.. strongly not recommended Urban Company for pest control...about other services after this not dare to take...
Jis kamm ke urban company wale split AC ke 600 mang rahe jo local ne 300 mai kar diya wo bhi same technology se...thnx for my self
Har ek parts change k sath kon 299 rs labour charge add karta hain????!!! Technician ek din mein 5 parts koi machine change kare toh 299√ó5=1495 leta Hain???!!! Lekin q??? Membership lene k baad pata chala terms and conditions kuch or hi hain!!! Service cost very much on higher site... More than 2.5 Guna hain local market se.... Market survey Kiya toh pata chala... Yeh bara vul ho gaya mere se. Membership bhi le liya Bina soche samjhe just trust kar ke!!! Bohut bara galti ho gayi!!!üòî

We booked for a premium deep clean for our appartment .Bikash and his team was excellent at their job. They were on time and executed their task in a professional manner. Thanks to the entire team.
extremely professional.. the guys who came to Clean, did their job quietly ..no extra talkin' or extra sounds . and now my house is very clean . very satisfying service .
Super
If your unable to send person on time.than please remove the option of select time slot from your app. I am not happy with your service.
It's was my First Experience with UC. And it has turned into a nightmare. From past 2 days I am scheduling my bookings. In First attempt, professional( Ramavtar) refuse to provide the service. And in 2nd attempt ,there are no professionals to take the bookings. For 6:30pm booking still waiting(6:15pm) professional to accept, but no respond. Since Morning in the app portal it's showing that our team member will call you soon, but called none.It's Pathetic experience ,will never recommend to any.
Good experience üôÇ
Third class service
very worst app and services.after taking booking slot not came.no any notification about booking or cancellation after time slot over.not get help from customer help centre.not any customer help number given in the app.after giving feedback only get sms that we will call you back in 15 minut.but not get any call.so please dont use this app.many more good apps available in market
worth every single bit of it, m very glad I chose it
Booked first service AC cleaning and had a awesome experience
Competent associates with polite attitude
it's amazing app but it's need to be cheap little bit
Good service
Amazing
Worst service. I asked for AC service and told them to bring gas to be filled as gas is low and requires R32 gas. they denied stating can't be done we don't give fast service we will check then willsee what to do. I already checked with local technician and he did not have vacuum pump so checked urban company service which proved to be worst. Update after 4 hours: My AC was fixed by other service provider with less chrg. Loss for UC soon some other service provider will takeover UC customers.
Pathetic service. AC servicing guy was awful and after 7 days i can't rate him so he didn't complete his job.
Worst company. AC has Leakage issue and they said we are not able to find the Leakage. They keep asking me to refill the gas and get serviced so they can charge me atleast 3000 rs. 2500 for gas and 600 for Servicing. But I said first resolve the Leakage issue they declined that and said we can't resolve that. Then I asked please send another technician if this technician can't resolve the issue, UC customer care said they will not arrange another technician and immediately canceled booking.
good service.
Urban clap have ruined my good refrigerator worst service
The professional didn't use d machine to get rid off the waterscales on the tiles used for first time n not satisfied remaining good
THUG
I saw the advertisement and thought them professional. My first time experience has been bad. I chose 4 pm slot. No body ever called nor responded when they could not assign a technician. I am compelled to reschedule against my wishes. I hope they honour the revised time schedule.
Pathetic service.
Pathetic services. The technician was unprofessional and unknowledgeable. There seems to be a problem with Fan connector but with technicians limited knowledge the entire fridge has stopped working now and display is also not working. I need a fix for this problem.
AC installation slot was booked for 1600 hrs today and at 1538hrs, you have cancelled my booking. This was truely unprofessional , my whole day got wasted due to this. If slots were not available you must have not accepted it and kepted on hold. Really Disappointed
nice
Excellent üëåüëå
Fine
Worst service I will post this in social media so that will understand how pathetic is ur service u people taking money before be the service and now ur not even responding to the issue . This is how u treat ur customers. My slot booking is at 3 pm still there is no update and even a call from u.

I have raised a concern two weeks back about lost items , I am not getting any response from the customer support, worst ever customer support
Such a pathetic service. Worst experience and waste of time. Better to go for other app.
Everytime I book through this app professional is never assigned and they always reschedule it really fed up by this app.
Few technicians are very rude and prices are very high
pathetic professionals using UC's brand name for personal business gains
good work
Horrific app. Charges are too high. Sevice is too low. Just making money for their brand name.
One of the worst service urban company
superb
Charges r too much!!! Service not sure
Good Service
Very bad. Person was in very hurry. Skip one room and gone in 30 min. Money wastage
Very bad sarvice
very good app for service
They broke my TV... Now I have to pay rs 12000 for its repair.this was when i had hired the urban clap company employee for full 2 bhk flat cleaning service. my bed room t v was broke by the employees and whem i called to inform you people you simply refused to address the matter and i had to bear the cost and my tv screen was fully gone so had to just sell it for absolute loss and buy new tv for my bed room.
Soni was very good at her job. polite, professional. Did amazing eyebrow threading. Facial massage was also great üëç
Unprofessional and incompetent lot. Unnecessary and non stop phone calls/ messages yet complete chaos and inability to render even basic of the services
Poor poor service... Last moment cancellations...nonexsistant customer support... Urban company takes bookings days prior and then cancels in the last 5 mins... Rescheduled according to their whims and whishes and then to no surprise cancels again... A request to play store to allow minus rating...and I would give the highest minus rating to urban company...and reciprocate this to all social media platforms
As showed in UC advertisement.. ""There is no shower jet cleaning after foam applying""..They used only power jet cleaning.. While asking him on this he replied polite manner as ,"" UC has not provided that type of jet as showed in advertisements "".
Good place for all works üí™
Amazing one...each time I like the service the therapist ms.savita is all time the best 5* to her and urban company 5* good luck guys stay blessed.
After Urban company canceling my service for carpet cleaning by themselves is not returning my money.
Ro Aqua guard
Pathetic and disappointed
While booking for bathroom & chimney cleaning in urban company, I'm not getting the option to choose the same professional who has serviced earlier. I want the same professional because when I tried with other professionals, the services were not good at all & they changed more by upgrading the service. I was totally disappointed with that. Now if this continues, I've to stop using urban company from now onwards.
Really pathetic service i have received from urban company
Worst experience there own professional saying they dont get paid by urban company and at the end we customer have to bear the loss
excellent
Fraud company. Damaged my appliance and are not contacting for a resolution now.
I am so annoyed that I had to file a police complaint against an urban company employee. I had booked a person to fix my pot and hydrant, he removed the pot from its place and I don't know what all he did the pot was still not fixed and the water in the pot was not moving with a speed as before, ie he blocked it. 1 problem turned into 2. The next day when I called him again he told it is not possible, how can I do it in a very rude üò§ manner I was also angry that he is refused we had a fight.
Really good service. Update on 11 April 2022 Excellent service rendered. Value for money. Thanks
Wrost service
I had booked overhead tank cleaning. The plumber broke a valve fitting and left without informing. I have been facing very tough water supply issue. In warranty visits are not being done UC Customer care is also not responding to call back requests. I was promised a service and cost reimbursement of the fitting but 4 days have passed since then. I'm left with no option but to get the repair done thru local plumber and pay for it all iver
I'm a prime member and yet i don't have the privilege to cancel my bookings and not get 50Rs deducted from my account. The UC membership is a total failure please don't buy it ever
Pathetic application. Won't even allow to manage the address.
excellent service
Untrained and rough service professional. They always look to cheat by claiming spare parts are damaged for any repair work of appliances
Worst customer service! Harassing customers and taking them for a fool. Complete money making organization. If it's a free revisit under warranty, they will harass you by not following up when the technician does not visit even after 48 hours! WORST PLACE EVER!
Bad customer experience. Techinician refuse to service just before the booking time. No support was provided by customer care. Go for local technician.
Good services

I referred my friend, whe he logs in it show him 100rs off. he logs into the app and found a ac service for 799 where as when I login I found the same service for 699. Is it really an off
Before cervicing my AC fan was not working ..i said ok just do the servicing as I am not using my AC from a long time will see this after servicing done ...after servicing when he connected it was working fine ...but then started demanding money as per him it's compony policy your AC fan was not working ... I asked him it just started working after surviving you have done anything ..later I paid him as he stated misbehave thanks i m fine with my Voltas service centre
Great AC service we received üëç
I had very nice experience by taking service form this platform and it's very useful
Skilled staff
Total scam . No services provided . You gave time slot. I booked service 5 freaking days in advance and at the time of service , no one is assigned. Then when you assign someone that person says he is not coming . In 42 degrees you are playing this pathetic game with a customer who has booked ac servicing. Why did you accept booking when you did not have professional to assign.
Good, very useful for general use
Excellent and justified advice
service was Perfect but little costly
Good
This company is not at all customer friendly. They only permit one way communication and don't keep any scope for discussion.
Very good service
Very bad experience Not worth mentioning Just befooling people
Very poor service and cheeting not doing as per TV advertisement
Not using app what is the issue?
I give you rating zero. Because your technical advisor/engineer are dumb in our work. There have insufficient knowledge. My A/C was not cooling and not doing any service activities. He's given help by other engineer by mobile calling to him. My balance amount not send my wallet only msg given me.
Many times we are not getting any service or the bookings are cancelled as no technician is available.
Booked services no one showed up, this happened twice in 2 days. The call center guy super duper rude. My credit which was there is gone. Since last 4 hrs I have been. Trying to reach you there is no one calling back. I don't understand why do you guys even commit that we'll get call back in 15 min bug actually it's been more than 2 hrs no one has reached. This is highly disappointing, no way that I can reach to you guys.
excellent reasonable service
Ford company not working customer care
More than satisfied
overall good and timely service
I have had two bad experiences in a day...one when the agent was untrained and made me bleed as she waxed.Then when i booked another slot,the agent didnt arrive nor did i get a call back and i had paid extra for the slot.such unprofessional and horrible service.
excellent job done by UC
You have not given me discount of‚Çπ 300/-for servicing 3no.window AC, as shown in your app at the time of booking. On 3rd day to change the condenser of my split AC, 15% discount on spare parts also not given, as shown in your app. All the related screen shots are posted in your what's app account. This is totally unspectable from your Company. Take appropriate steps.
Wanted only hair colour but had to book manicure forcibly.the beautician simmi sethi gave a very bad service only buttery talk
Oftenly professional was not assigned. Some of the services like bathroom intense cleaning is waist of time and money they even they don't have proper tools for cleaning, didn't do the job as they claimed in advertisment.
Our costly property was damaged by urban clap. No response from them. Don't use urban clap services.
Very unprofessional bookings handling from so called professional Company i.e. UC or I will name them as "RURAL COMPANY - RC" Who even not know who much staff need to carter the customer needs.üò±‚òπÔ∏èüò§üò†üò°ü§¨ May GOD helps their Customers................. "Unchi Dukan fikaa Pakwan"

Very bad management. A professional who was assigned to clean my kitchen came to my house but he then refused to do the work and then left. Please do something about it.
Nice company
Good service experience by the professionals üëçüèº
Everytime I try to book a service it says slot full and all are busy all the time, since the time of download, worst experience
Provides fake offers just to lure you to download there app . And urban company has deleted my review 2 time because i expossed them üòÇüòÇ.
Very good and professional workers
Nice experience with AC Service
Excellent
Totally unprofessional, they charge extra
Work done by the guys is very good. I took intense bathroom cleaning services... It was done very good. Keep up the good service. I am satisfied with the hassle free service.
Worst app ever!!! Here the professionals cancel your booking without even asking you and neither will you get the same time slot and your booking will be changed to the next date. If one single day they cancelled my 4th booking.. i am fed up from this UC
Very satisfying, and perfect serviceing
Professional arrived late and declined to even do the assigned service. This has happened twice in 2 days. 2 complaints in 2 days but no resolution so far.
good service tq for uc.
I gave a 5 star thinking they did a good job but my AC's started blowing hot air. Beware as the technicians are fraudsters. Cheats. Unbelievable that such technician was sent to me a long time customer. Very sad with this. And no follow up.

excellent service
I used several times and technicians are good at service
Workers seems less mature skill wise.
all spares sold on double price
very good
Professionals at Urban Company are excellent and know their work very well.
What a fraud company. First of all there is no customer support for any kind of grievance. Have booked AC repair a month back wherein the professional broked the swing clip and tried to hide by saying there was no clip in it. When i showed him the broken part he accepted his mistake after 30 min and asked me to give 5rating with a promise that he will bring new clip and fix it in 2 day and stopped responding when i escalated this on UC, he came to my house with very rude attitude
Very good service . Technitians are very well trained . Absolutely recommended
Highly unprofessional. They cancelled 5-6 slots.
Customer care doesn't respond. Worst experience!
Happy with 2nd experience too
Depending on Urban Company was my worst decision ever and one of the worst experiences I have had.
service charges please reduce
I have hot sacrifice with your wark your wark is bad
well done his job
Charging extra money after paying bill amount through online mode
I just have one word to say and that is superb
Booking interface not functioning. Can't place an order. Can't see what I have piled into my cart.
Rates increased without prior notice.
good
Fantastic application to resolve your home utilities appliances problem
Language is the main issue pls give the language option while booking the service in app because not all people can understand hindi or english. pls add telugu speaking candidates
Thanks Urban company for best service.
Very bad experienced with urbanpro.Never book anything from them. Worst service attitude and poor mentality. I have booked ac installation for 3 times and everything they cancel without any prior information. Book from local vendor. Don't trust this company
Good service..
Very bad not clearly wash and very professional
Dehati staff. Uneducated people hired from slum.
high price,low collaty
Superb service. Very professional
Please use this app and its services wisely or else they will overcharge you and their customer support executive behaviour is pathetic.
The app always got a glitch at the payment page after choosing the payment mode. I can't seemed to pass that stage every single time.
Price for services have increased steeply.
good
The conditions and payments that urban company provides is very worst. I won't refer urban company to anyone. Please dont book any services from urban clap. Very worst experience I faced today. They are cheating the costumers alot. They are not following the conditions that they are mentioning in the app. Customer care executes are also not helpful. Very worst service ever.. Please guys don't get into trouble by booking the service.
Good app
Worst! I had to book a revist has issue started again after post service, but no technician was coming to solve i'v rescheduled twice because os the technician but no technician were coming for revist to solve the issue..
The service is really excellent and reliable.
Thief company. Stealing people's money to line their own pockets.
Worst service providers ever!! Don't use there services(any of it) you will definitely regret it. I repaired my ac from these people and after 10 days it stopped working and nobody came to check it again. Customer care is the worst. They will console you but no one provide you a viable solution.
Very good
Unprofessional staff. My Booking was at 12 and no body is here it's 12:30 PM already. No response from the support team as well. It's a paid order. Highly recommend not using their services.
mast
I am getting great services from Urban Clap in different fields. Thank you so much.
nice work
Changing my ratings from 5 to 3. Poor service off late from UC. They automatically reschedule confirmed booking. Hardly care to give a call if service is delayed. Service wrt to Salon for women rescheduled as per their convenience. AC service delayed. Pest control poor workmanship. üëé UC.
Terrible experience today. Took the money, cancelled the service and then tell me refund in 7 days to my wallet. Not only have you annoyed me by the bad experience, you have also been aken away my money for 7 days. This is illegal, since you cancelled the service and it was a wallet payment, so how come RBI allows you to keep the amount for 7 days.
services ok
Outstanding
I am satisfied with uerban company ...
Bad service
I used their plumbing service and I must say they are very good.
great service with last minute booking. staff are professional.
Getting service from here is just like a lottery. U may get good service or the worst service too.better spend more in training the technician and save money by doing less advertisements.
Nice service and work!
perfect
Application and service both perfect UI is simple and easy to navigate, till now I have used 1 service for my fan and I am quite satisfied with the outcome.
booked foam service for split ac but technician arrived without foaming solution.. I had booked the service with UC only because of getting foam service.. a little disappointment.. paid 498 for simple water jet service..
Worst service, I booked my AC servicing well in advance but they didn't assigned any professional for that and finally when my appointment time came they started calling and telling that no professional is available, started rescheduling and finally I cancelled my booking. Simply bad service. It's better to call your local mechanic then waiting for professional of urban company
No services in my area, it showing... Nice
video consultation is an excellent concept. the concerned expert makes an assessment and gives guidance immediately. Booking of technician is also done immediately. will update tomorrow regarding competence of technician after repair job .
Horrible! Their customer service is as good as there being no customer service at all. I have been asking for a call back for a pending booking since yesterday and They refuse to get in touch. I am shocked and they are far from what they advertise themselves to be.
hj
Its an awesome app & the professionals are doing a fabulous job.
Even after buying thier membership you don't get service professional assigned to you on time.
it's costly else ok
Why don't you provide haircut services for girls & women??? Why only for men???
Cheating with people..don‚Äôt care about customers..very disappointing
Rates are higher...
First time experience... Superb.... Excellent AC service.
Our split AC.was working very fine untill yesterday when deep cleaning servicing was done amounting to Rs.750.After servicing, condenser stopped functioning and there's practically no cooling at all.We are very disappointed with the service.
Bad experience, no professional available
good
all the best
Best service
Person sent for bathroom cleanig Mrs Sujitha is highly arrogant and refused to attend work when asked the solution She left without answering we feeling ashamed of such services of your company My amount of Rs 747 also blocked with your company pl refund my amount Atleast
Good service and professionals.
very nice
I had booked for cleaning service for 8am on Sunday, till now they UC have not send anyone. The person who is assigned is not having vehicle to come. What kind of professionalism is this ?. Please don't provide false promises...it's shameful from your part.
good service this time only
Urban making us fool on warrantyl, no customer care number and help line number.i m trying from last 5 days to connect these guys but no response from urban clap..
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Very bad service urban company don't trust service boy only making money ü§¨üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°

Dont go for it. They have lot of bugs in their app.
I found services to be prompt and satisfactory. This is the 4th time I booked service and each time it was perfectüëç keep up the good work UC
nice
Very smooth
Service is ok, but the app has glitches and doesnt allow termination. Have called the customer service to cancel twice but nothing has been done since i reported. Chances that my credit card details has been compromised.
good
ok
Every time good service
A company with very poor feedback or follow up mechanism ...unable to find a slot to attend a get the rework job done. Extremely disappointed.
Nice
Concern even not revert back for inconvenice .very disappointed.worst experience with UC team.techinican not in proper uniform ,polybag to cover & cloths to clean are also provided by us (which should be included in package). Formcleaning done even after taking deep cleaning pakage of Rs548/-.Technican also called client to help in removing & placing AC.
My first experience was good.
They book the slot but are unable to provide the service personnel and asking me to constantly reschedule the appointment. Worst service..
Pathetic service. Actually they don't even assign the professional and reschedule or cancel the booking at their own will. I Highly recommend NOT TO USE THIS APP! Their coustomer care services is useless n rude. They cancelled my booking at last moment even after I waited for an hour. So disappointed, unprofessional n horrible service.
Since yesterday morning I am trying to schedule microwave service and paid membership amount but getting popup that all the professional are busy and will notify you.
UC made me wait for 3 days over not working fridge and was unable to assign a technician on 4th day too. I will recommend you to hire technicians who are willing to work.
Good servers
Gud
Bad
Bad
Rates are not stable. Rates of AC repairing shown 499 but when you book the order it is 748.. Really unacceptable 50%hike
Very bad service.....
The UC representative didn't cleaned the bathroom properly. For deep cleaning, he should have used the equipment shown in video however he didn't carried it. Before start of work, I asked for additional work to clean kitchen, he did it and took money into his personal google account where I was interested to pay to UC. Very poor service. When I registered complain, they were ready for refund. I was expecting another person to come & complete the remaining work but they didn't agreed.
Well done
Am using it for 3 yrs now very convenient
Worst maintenance The prices While Booking the service is different once the service completed charging extra amount
e excellent work
Unprofessional and unempathetic service. Donot maintain timings, helpline and customer care services are worst
Bad experience
Very poor service of Urban company and you can't rely on them.
If you have my rating concept for customer as well. You should have proper criteria for it. Any professional can give their desire rating regardless of the customer behaviour.
awesome service
slow app. High convenience fees
good service
Good monitoring and suggestions for satisfaction the customer
Unprofessional, the professional are almost never on time and the help center is just useless
Thank you for good consulting service.
We are getting very bad experience from Urban Company, we booked a technician for 5.30 slot and he called at at 5 and requested to reschedule at 8, we considered that and booked for 8 p.m. and at 8 he called and saying that he can't come. Highly unprofessional approach from the company after paying in advance. Will recommend please rethink before booking
When their employees / partners come to deliver the service, they do a good job. But it's impossible to figure out if they will actually come or not. They come only 50% of the time, which means you can't rely on them. Last-minute cancellations, excuses, delays are all part of the experience.
good
Technicicans are not trained. Overpriced. They are charging 500 for water purifier installation. Kent technician charged only 300 for installation. They are looting Your technician that came for water purifier installation , don't  even know how to fit the inlet pipe of purifier .He told we need plumber to fit the inlet pipe. Is this what you are calling a highly skilled  professional?? Looting a customer shouldn't be termed as "competitively setting market standards ".
Pathetic professional service don't avail. Misrepresentation of the facts. Not at all trained. They damage the parts and post that nobody takes the ownership of the task
Good. Professional
Not recommended! because their prices are very high compared to market & maids are totally untrained & unprofessional with no time management, if we pay more we want HiFi services but the service providers are really not worth the money.
ADVANCE BOOKING PAYMENT KARNE KE BAAD AUR BOOKING SCHDULE FIX HONE KE BAAD BHI TECHNICIAN VISIT NAHI KARTA HAI.VERY VERY POOR SERVICE .
good work
Very bad
It's take to much time ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
time of booking shows discount and after service again charges discounted amount in UC app through technician.
The look and feel is good. 1 bug that I found was that when you login with someone's referal link the UI is different for checkout. Also, if you try to apply UC cash there, it doesn't work. Then if you close the app and open again you'll see the original UI. Now u'll be able to add the UC cash in your payment. I feel this should be fixed ASAP.
good
As per the service they will use foam technology while servicing but technician is not having the foam....want refund for 1 AC service...
This is the worst app i have ever seen in my life. I booked AC service even after payment completed no one came for service. When called to customer care they replied professional not available.
best
Good service
Excellent
AC professional lied and did not come for AC service. Even UC call center person could not help locate ac professional. Nothing special about UC service.
excellent job.but took a lot of time to satisfy me with perfect cleaning
very useful app.. Fully Satisfactied...
Handy Staff usefull
good service
Not up to mark
Worsted service very bad
Worst services by urban company. They are just take money from customer and not schedule any technician even after too many request on cutomer care. Worst app
Completely worst service provider ever. I booked a technician through urban company for deep cleaning of AC. After that I felt sensor problem and remote failure in the AC. Same technician visited again but again same problem occured. Now, the work assigned to a new technician but he didn't come to look into the matter. In my view everyone should refrain from obtaining any services from this cheater service provider keeping the fact that professionals are less qualified who may put you in loss.
OMG! Too Good, Good Experience by me......
Worst customer support every other executive will call but no one knows the issues..
Very good service
excellent service
very intuitive
My AC is not working properly (automatically switching off) after the cleaning service provided by Urban Company. After hectic calls to the serviceperson and cuatomer care, he service person assured to visit again the smae day to reolve the issue. But now, he is not responding.I sincerely suggest not to book services under Urban Company - very costly, very poor serv√≠ce (in fact which renders your appliance useless).
I have being using urban company for my Bathroom cleaning,sofa cleaning,salon and pest control.It is being a great experience with them. I would like to mention the most important thing is that all the employee at very polite.
very nice work
Very poor services Not doing proper Job as described
Actually I booked for service from last 2 week , I found slots but no technician assigned message came when scheduled time came. So if you want to service your ac then please go for another way otherwise you may be bemoan for ac service through UC customer care.., but he can't do anything.
Niceee
Very good app, I have used it for AC service and liked it
If giving negative rating is possible i would have done that.. Worst behavior.. Totally Non professional.. Waiting for a service for a whole day still no respond
Very bad experience as I have booked for an appointment later on due to some so n so reason have cancelled it,they were deducted 299rs,Do not opt for this service and have not expected this from you are company.1 rating is also waste.
Abi nahi bata sakti isilie abhi ke k lie
Disappointed with the service. 1st time when I booked - The professional don't have the equipment to complete the job saying we don't have that in Ranchi now.(scrubbing Machine for cleaning tiles of bathroom) And also did not clean the fittings saying we don't do that or cannot do because i don't have proper equipment. I am not making a issue just asking to complete the job as mentioned in the description you guys are providing on your app. Experience was like ordered helicopter got bycycle.
Perfect cleaning of AC.
Very user-friendly, highly professional & reliable company with excellent working professionals. The first choice for my requirements.
Technitian ask for undue repairs and request
UC is very convenient, value for money, saves time and provides professional services.
Work done excellently with sincerity.
it was a very good experience ...she did very good job.
just write once even I was afraid I don't know how come they do the service but they are so professional now I am ordering for the therapist at my home and salon for my wife
No customer support
gud
They would make your life hell by sending various marketing messages daily.
Good service expeciance. I'll definatily recommend.
the cleaning experience was good, they used foam jet cleaning and our AC was clean as new.
Hi, They r fooling the people by giving false and misleading adds. Their purpose is to fool the people and earn the money. They charged Rs.548 in the name of deep cleaning of bathroom, but done nothing. My bathroom is still dirty. Its good for nothing. The machine is useless. The money had been been wasted.
Worst App. Not user friendly at all. Won't allow to update the address instead it will take the address automatically. Ihad terrible experience.
Best service
Every time whenever I book online again the person who come for the service he will say this will not work out he need some extra money last time I have booked the intense bathroom cleaning not at all satisfied
Too much cost for simple spare and also for small work.
Super arrangements....
Misleading customers and damaging the parts Felt like being cheated by this white collar way.
My Air condition has stopped cooling just after a week. The highest official should be concerned about the end to end services. I am now scared with other services of urban company.
great service app
They never let you select your preferred professional. I requested mani-pedi and they assigned a professional automatically which I didn't like I asked to change professional and the assigned the same lady again 1 hr before my service! I requested cancellation and they charged me 25 AED.
Very poor no professional is available and you need to reschedule all the time once payment has been made
Got good technicians for my appliance service.
A LOOTING company.Small task at hand is made to look so difficult and requires a skilled worker whereas its only a small task. Outside business and real skilled person does not charge according to this company standards. Not at all customer friendly and doesn't give a damn about the customer. Avoid any bookings from this app. Wearing a urban company t shirt doesn't make one a skilled worker. Workers need better knowledge and need to low down the bill amount.
üëçüèª
good
Very unprofessional... Even they dont bother to connect you n resolve your problm
THE PERSON CAME TO SERVICE HE TOLD I WONT ABLE TO DO JOB LAST JOB ALSO WAS DONE BY HIM AND WAS VERY BAD HE JUST TOLD ME TOO GIVE 5 STAR NO USE OF IT WE ARE UN HAPPY AND NOW ALSO HE IS READY TO DO 1 SPLIT AC 1 HE IS NOT DOING
I purchased water purifier but neither machine was delivered nor anybody contacted and ultimately I had to cancel my order.
I could rate by negative I would have given that.. I prebooked the service a day before but at the time of appointment they called up and say no one is available for the whole day and due to technical issue the slot was not booked.. if the slot was not booked then how did they knw abt my appointment.. I wasted my time so much.. I am so so disappointed.. this was the first time I was using this app and got this experience.. Too bad
AC service was awesome
Good service but charges of spare parts are very high
One of the worst customer service there is, raised my issue on 22nd March still haven't received a single call from them, even after re initiating request multiple times. Just pathetic.
not good dont call urban company very bad
Worst oline service providers, their best of technician are dealing with party after getting drunk.
Not sending experienced technicians ...team are relying on back end team..
ok
excellent services
Pathetic service from UC, they have tied local cheap ac service people and make them wear UC t shirts and send to your home. The guy who came to service didn't had even the foam to service the AC. While i opted an dlaid for foam ac service which coated me 150/- higher than normal service. But when the device person of UC cane he said sir i don't have that, aap yahi karva lo. Third class service from UC. Cheap. I would never use their services. Have uninstalled their app.
did a very good job without any damage
Used plumbing service in the past. It was a horrible experience where the customer is looked upon as a revenue generation tool. Tried booking full home cleaning service today. The prices are ridiculously high. It should make some sense if it has to be preferred over the unorganised house help options available. Uninstalled the app
Worst
Pathetic service. I had booked service 3 days before scheduled time still they could not send anyone to my place for the service.
great service
Please add furniture polish service also.
good work
Good
Meena Rokade thank you for relaxing and refreshing massage. After hectic schedule of work this massage reboot my energy levelüòä She is punctual and very good in her work
Super
Worst app experience ever.. not able to book a revisit since your professional has damaged my ac
Everytime, they accept a service. At the nick of the time they call up and say that no professional is available n will reschedule the appointment. This happened to me for the last three times. Never prompt
Professional does not care. Time waste for the customer. Helpline not helpful at all.
great work
nice
Finally resolved the issue. Thank you for attending my issue within time.
Booked a water purifier,sent a technician without purifier, and as raised concern no one responded back... pathetic service never expected from UC ,it's been 3 days and no one responded..how can we trust and buy purifier from ur app, no customer care number also to call back
quite professional service
i don't know why im not able to book an appointment for a maassage therapy for today. it is asking to rety the payment again and again. im sick of this now.
Unable to book.
excellent
Just awesome experience
it's good
Very good service
It served my purpose quite well!!
I'm quite impressed with the level of service and attention to detail that the company (no pun intended) provides. Do keep up the good work!
Truely satisfied
Rates are hiked after the technician visits the house, though you have already paid while booking, the app updates the rate card and asks you to pay more money even though there is no additional service required. The service professional are good and behave very politely. However, it is the app/company which is having the problem.
URBAN CLAP provides pathetic services and they just loot the customers. I have taken an AC repair service and paid for the service, the technician came and repaired the AC and after 3 days the same issue. I called the technician and he said that he need to take the AC for Inspection and will return it on next day. I agreed and he took the AC. After the repair the AC was working good but same issues after that. All bastards are there in Urban Clap.
The service is good but when we claim warranty it doesn't work and no response from the company
Good approach for booking etc ,tracking, scheduling etc.
Very bad service. Booking done for 9:30 am and later at 10:15 am they inform that no professional is available today and asking for rescheduling it for the next day. After payment and accepting booking this is not justifiable. Person has travelled over 1 hour for this work and then you'll tell can't be done today. You'll should close down this service/app. You'll are just a bunch of cheaters, taking membership charges and booking charges and not providing the service. Really pathetic.
Excellent
Worst app ever , never follows the schedule , whats the use of booking for anything?? And you guys are deleting my reviews again and again, worst possible team ever. I even asked u guys to call me from the app, its been 24hrs no one called
The app seem to focus on limiting the options of Reporting concerns like delays & inefficiencies .
I was thinking that UC is the most trusted app but i was so wrong it is not i booked a slot nd they cancelled without informing me it was urgent i really needed that's why i booked slot first time ever but they did wrong worse app if anyone have urgency Don't book any slot worst experience worst.
Great
Based on the reviews I have had read and the solution provided by urban clap.
Service is good.
Unprofessional...they rescheduled my booking date with out information.
good work
Can't fill otp on website.
Very bad company
Wrost App Don't Download it.. Ye App Sirf Apko Bewakuf Bnata Hai Aur Kuch Ni Krta.. Membership To Bilkul Na Le Koi Mai Lekr Pachta Rha Hu Aur Refund Policy Hai Hi Ni.. Mai Jitni Baar Bhi Service Lena Chaha Inka Slot Full Dikha Mujhe. Raat 2 Bje Bhi Slot Book Dikha Raat 2 Bje Likh Rhy Hai Hamare Professional Abhi Busy Hai Try Again Leter. Koi Customer Care Number Ni Hai Jisse Baat Ho Sake Aur Problem Bta Sku.. In Short Bhot Hi Ghatiya App Hai Zindagi Me Kabhi Isko Download Ni Krna Pachtaoge...
very good
This is the worst app they help u get some services done and also provide a 30 days warranty on those services when try to claim the warranty the app wont allow to get a revisit on any services worst experience ever.
Uc has cheated us with out Information has remove the category! I wont back car cleaning category
Not bad ok ok üëå
Bug ü™≤üêõ is mobile heating
Happy with the urban company service..used multiple service till date & no issue with any kind of services yet
perfect service with no hurry and polite behaviour.
First-of-its kind app in India with a novel, game-changing concept. Excellent UI/UX to match. Great experience using the app. Highly recommended for every urban resident.
Very bad customer service provided, no value for consumers
Very bad experience will never call anyone from this company lost Rs 900 useless servicing paid again next day for the same.
I am satisfied with UC.. Mr. Danish & his companion (Service boys) were very cordial & professional... good job done... keep it upüëçüëç
awesome
Always on time and professional
The staff arrive at the designated time, are quite polite and go about their task with professional efficiency and thoroughness.
I have a single recliner that needs cleaning. Can it be done?
Very Bad experience Hiring staff with No technical Knowledge and training to speak to their clients
Unprofessional
Superbbbbbbbb trust me try it
Pathetic Service
Don't go with this. I booked at 4th April for ac service and now the date is 9April. Atleast, engineer not assigned
They are cheating the customer. Initially come to and they'll say like so many issues and they'll take the machine parts along with them and he will never come back and also he never respond to you call. I suggest people don't trust this app. And I lost my washing Machine even they don't have Customer service. When you raised a ticket u get the pop up as call back in 15min and u never get call. Don't trust it's a cheating and money making with customers situation.
OklikeHii
Hello sir . When is set up in Agra
I booked a deep cleaning, company vedio shows foam wash but there was nothing like foam wash. Only water wash.
Worst customer support, worst top management, worst service. Have my complain pending since months. Their technicians are not trained properly but only provided with equipments. My AC was not working, booked a technician at urbanclap, after inspection was told to change the motor which would cost 7000rs without warranty, while few days later called a local technician and he repaired it with few parts changed which costed me just rs1000. Very disappointed and dissatisfied with these idiots.
Never trust them for AC work Booked their service for split ac, the technician gave me an estimate for ‚Çπ10000 1500 for installation 2500 for gas (even though gas was ok) 5400 for copper wire, 900/mtr, even though the existing wire was usable 500 for servicing And he even was not ready to fit the way I wanted coz it needed extra efforts Sent them back and got it done from local guys, just at 1900‚Çπ, 1400 for installation and 500 for service 10000 vs 1900 just imagine the loot
Nice service
Very worst company..
Good
technician is well professional and good at work.
very nice
Excellent
ur options are not enough. cash on delivery is not available.
very good service
Their home cleaning services are excellent
Ac service was very poor.Not addressed my complaints properly.waste of money.Deep AC service is only in words.single star is also not eligible for AC service.
excellent
The worst Company ever, called a guy for AC Deep cleaning service and the God knows what that guy did with my AC, it's not working now and when I called the company for the same, they just raised there hand and said nothing can be done. Never book any technical service from Urban Company.
passing information about us perfect that has to maintain
wonderful service
Nice service and reasonable too
Best app for all services
great service and nice people
Third class service. I have it zero..
excellent
Pathetic service .. people are really unprofessional they want to earn extra and issue remains unresolved.. there is no competition that's the only thing
Money making through the app. Without doing a nn y service
best service
Functionality of the app doesn't work properly
good
not able to track the service man
One of the lier company who don't value time with providing fake promises to customer. Because these people don't have enough professional for any booking. Last time also I booking and these never had enough professional. They always ask customer to reschedule and top of that if we don't reschedule and get cancel for money back they take 1 weeküò†üò† These kind of apps just spend money on adds only. Thanks Urban Clap for giving such a wonderful experience üôè
Excellent
This is so disgusting that I got my 4 Air conditioner serviced on 19th March 2022. Out of which one stopped working on 21st March another stopped working on 4th April and one stopped working today (8th April) I am sure that Hasan Khan (theft) is taking out some parts as he always requested me and family to be out of the room while servicing and he took some parts of my AC with him due to which this is happening. And urban company is just not responding to any call, requests for callback
Excellent
Good service
I have been buying it for 3 years for beauty service and also for pest control etc.and many more And, I am very happy with their service Thanks UC company
Unprofessional Team. They never respond on your issues and complaint. All the claim posted on App is false.. there is no choice rather then accept their quality of service they do.. Fake people.. Even they do not respond after your compliments. They are cheaters.. Fraud....
Unsatisfactory at times.
They sent Ac scammers to our house and they started asking for around 8000 rs cash.
nice work
Very good service
Worst experience n worst urban company I m unhappy with my booking experience
professional
Excellent service
Good..
Service is very good....
Job well done. Good.
Very good app
nice experience
Very good ac service...i like this company
Service charges are auto hiked by ‚Çπ100 when I got ‚Çπ100 coupon by referral. Normally service price of a window AC is ‚Çπ599 but I have been shown ‚Çπ699.
Poor service, they are unable to cater inside city limits, you need to spend hours and the app will bark, slots are full.. Rather it should say we have shortage or no people fir auch services
super to public
I opt UC for the first time and experience till the time is not good at all. Firstly, service was done by unprofessional, did all the mess and left saying service is done. I raise complaint that was answered and 1 professional came. Did his things and I was satisfied for a while. But after few days some burnt wire smell is coming from my AC. Regretting now for choosing urban company instead of getting the service done from company's professional.
Service by urban company not satisfied
urban company is doing a good job there workers have good knowledge about the stuff they are doing I liked when the Ac serves came and did there work
Good job
good service
Very good and good behaviour with customer
Just got by AC cleaned. Great professional service.
Mr. Khan did a very professional job. he was very kind and courteous. Recommend him for others
not perfect cleaning , saying that it will go next time
Recent experience on Salon booking.. Hair color was earlier by default Ammonia free (not mentioned in specific) which costed ‚Çπ499, which shockingly shooted up to ‚Çπ799 labeling it Ammonia free hair color, while ‚Çπ499 hair color is with Ammonia. Not a trust worthy experience!!
A valuable app for the urban households
Worst experience
Happy'with service
very usefull App
Horrible experience
Good
You have not taken my consent to rate me as a customer so I will raise this with consumer forum
good app
Not at all Professionals, I booked AC service a week before and on the day of service they called me to tell that, they are full of services today, so service will be available on day after tomorrow. Then why am i selecting date and time a week before, if you want service to happen at your date and time. Not going to recommend anyone else for this app. Don't ask me to write mail to you because I'm not going to write it.
Non responsive, no way to connect customer care. Booking done and paid online, but no assignment of personal even after 1 hr of scheduled time. Pathetic services.
Excellent
Good
No customer care where we complain
Slow, pathetic and Buggy app. Exorbitant prices for miniscule jobs. Late, dubious and duplicitous service. They are cheaters and fraudsters.Non existent customer support. Won't even process refund. No terms and conditions mentioned in app. They frame sentences vaguely to cheat and loot customers. No customer support provided in the app. Even email id has not been mentioned in the app. They ask the customer to Google their email address. Useless fellows.
It has been 2 week now post UC service where My AC gone faulty. Service team visited and made some changes under warranty post which as well issue not fixed. I am repeatedly informing them and requesting call back from UC company as promise made by Shriya isnt met . This is pathetic and during such hot summers you guys are not standing on your words. Requesting others as well to be cautious because they initially told me Gas needs to be refilled and I did it and more issues after this refill.
They committed for 8am and professional not assigned till 9am. No one is responding. No customer connect. Pathetic services
Rates are too high
dont waste your time and money please take near by local technicion to repair your applinces.
good
Superb
Refund my 20dhs I didn't ask for renewal.. Refund immediately
Scope not explained depending on the house and goods
Major drawback is that they have no toll free customer care number!
Tele sales and operational team are so irresponsible with solutions after 4 days i have got the service from the date of payment. But the professional who were come are so mannered and polite in work.
It is extremely disgusting as it always said no operators available. This is happening from last 3 to 4 months. If they don't have resources they should just go off market.
I dont think they fulfill the standard of work they showcase in videos and promotions. By far one of the worst service provider. They geniunely dont have professional people on board with them. All they gave is desi stuff and staff. I would appeal people to stay away from this app if you dont want to feel like you are fooled by someone badly. They dont know meaning of Commitment, trust, honesty, promise etc etc, they just use this words but never implement it. Not at all recommended
Please provide good conditioned bags to servicing excecutive..water is leaked through bag and flow in my room.
Awesome
Worst app don't go for it have very unprofessional technicians and don't have manners too Also I paid for ac leakage service and technician repair it and next morning it started again leaking.... very poor service better go for local service agent s.
Please increase your locations we stay in shamshabad and there is no service here
First time i am booking urban company for beauty service. I recommend every one to use this service. priya the one who came to my house was too quick and perfect in her service happy happy
Excellent
Easy to use and get people to work at your door steps but quality of work is not satisfactory even after paying many times than a locally available worker.
A1 invention service
It's a fraud company who don't know how to treat their employees.Being an urban company partner from last so many years they have suddenly removed our category of makeup artist without giving our credits backs..... highly disappointed
I think everyone should try atleadtonce urban company's service its amazing.i m happy.Thank you UC team.
Ac tecnixcion mosim Khan in agra city is fraud , he is leak my outdoor gas and come there without oppointment
Makes required services a lot comfortable
Good
Nice sevices

very good service
Madhu is a good beautician I would like to call her for next service.
Worst experience, very unprofessional way of working. Its not at all like what they show and depict. Over charges with not even satisfactory service. Customer service does not even responds back. Please refund my money. As per your reply against my rating there is no response yet. The person has left eithout completing my job and you do not have the courtesy to give a call back also. Please refund my money.
The technician was not available on schedule slot and they did not even assigned any alternate technican nor received any proper communication from help desk or customer support pathetic service by urban clap ...
Service is good but it could be excellent with simple gadgets like mini vacuum cleaner for dirty floors or small mops for quick cleaning.
Extremely unprofessional ac technicians work with urban company. I booked ac servicing with UC, a technician nam3d julfekar came to do the service. I was not at home and he made a mess of a work in the name of ac service. Not only that, I booked revisit and i have been waiting for his revisit since 2 days and he doesn't show up. Terrible service.
Don't download it or else u will regret it later

Good experience for spa
Good
The service is excellent, and hospitality is also ossum
Worst service . Better take service from Local One . Will try to never use ..
The company is not customer oriented. The company always thinks that the repair engineers are correct. But atleast the engineers are not explaining the work to and do and explaining what they have done nor the customer care. Recently I used the washing machine cleaning and they charged INR 2200 for 1 hour service. When I asked the details the answer is what engineer is done is correct.Ridiculious beheavior from Urban company
Y bus lootne ke liey bani he company Qki me khud iska hissa reh chuka hu pleas ap log satark rate savdahaan rahe pehle Jane fir uska istemal kare
Worst customer support
Very poor service...i booked for ac installation on 30th March and paid 1548 online... no service was initiated..i cancelled my booking...they did not refund my money till date.
Not urban company it's Roberry company
No happy
good service
Gud
Fraud company..go for the service if you don't love your hard earned money...
No customer care number or support.
Bad experience as it was my first time and thought it might be good but unfortunately I was wrong .they did general service with gas refilling and charged 2500 /- for gas and 549 /- for service which compared later with other companies cost to high I recommend not to go for this company rather try someone else.
a very professionally done work.. I would recommend the company to all.. Jagdish was excellent in his conduct and professionally compenent.. Well done..
Best services
the categories are too set and there's less flexibility for custom services like carpentry
Good professional quality service, pricing could be a little better though
Complete unprofessional service. Did an AC cleaning service in which the technician broke the blower. The urban company call centre exec told me to end the service and he will call back with resolution. Still awaiting for the call back. It's been more than 3 hrs. Rather than improving your machine they destroy it! Pathetic!!!
Waste of time, technetian are not doing the work properly and customer support is useless
Very good services üëå
Pathetic
Very good app
Good experience .. Enjoyed many good services..
Very good service
yojana is very good for ayurveda massage.she took care of my mother.very soft spoken gentle efficient.
Worse service ever with salon. No professional was assigned nor any intimation from UC. Facing the same situation for the second time. I am responding to the comment below, i have already raised a complain and spoken to multiple people. Clearly, they can't help
thanks to UC customer service team...... they made my day we'll by following up with my issue ......thnks for fixing ....my only advice please try to recruit valid and certified tech for AC mech .... who ever cums they try to sell something ....
There is no way to talk to customer service if we hv any complaint about the service . Help center all automated selection options. For revisit service booking us impossible It keeps saying try later. And no option to call help center.
good
Good perfomance
Professionals are always "busy" and never "available" be it anytime of the day. No option to try and book for future dates as well.. UC is still not well established
technician Dharmesh did an excellent work.
As to my experience, people should always seek a second opinion like how you seek towards a Doctors or an Hospitals. Before you decide to accept services from this company. The integrity of the Representatives, are compromised and moreover they demand for a 5 star rating. Don't believe every thing they say. They want to become rich in a day while we slough our butts of for year's and still we live in struggles trying to make ends meet. I wish there were more than 500 words to say in brief.
Good experience
First time user.. work was done perfectly.
Limited service. They are not giving service even in Gurgaon(Haryana) Sector 108
Good service
Very nice
we can trust the service from UC with out any hesitation
Truly Professionals !
Pathetic service. They are simply giving excuse and asking to reschedule 15 minutes before.
Good
add showing Rs 499 but services taking 798 very bad
Unable to open it
Very expensive user experience need to improve
Customer service is terrible ..the executive are clueless how it work ,they are just helpless voice on phone
best and prompt service
good üëç
They came for geyser service and made it leak from the bottom, never called anyone from them, they will spoil the product then you have to invest 6-7k to make it working again.
This company will not take any responsibility and accountability. I booked for cleaning and at the time of scheduled work start, they simply said no professionals are available, please choose an alternate date and time. If it is within 30 minutes or 1 hour of booking, we could understand. This pathetic services comes with a sorry figure and a commitment that it won't happen in future.
Worst experience. They couldn't assign me a professional for my service since 2 days. I've heard a lot about their working style. But I'm highly disappointed. Even after informing my urgency, they didn't take any action. I doubt this app if it is bogus. Please don't rely on this app if you have something urgent as they won't understand. WORST APP OF I'VE EVEN COME ACROSS. THEY WILL CHARGE TOU VERY HIGH, WILL RVEN TAKE AN ADVANCE, BUT WONT FULFILL THEIR DUTY. I've already shared my concern on it
Excellent work done
Super

Don't ever choose UC for your AC repair. These are the worst people you will see in your entire life. They will repair the appliance which will last for two days(they definitely knew it for sure), meanwhile they will ask for rating. And after two days UC won't let you update the rating or service review. If you want to claim warranty, the slot will not be available for at-least 7 days, any sane person won't wait for this long. This is a big scam.
Farooq Ali who came to my home yesterday with two more helpers.I m sry to say that from my bathroom one small mirror ws missing so kindly I request u who has taken this who did thisjob.I will be grateful to u if I will get my thing back tks.Take action immediately.
Very good person Mr Prasad
It's was too much price
Amazing experience...Thanku Urban company
super
nice service
Not at all user friendly.
üéÜ
one of the best service done by urban company, all their staff is outstanding in their fields. YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME.
Dont use it .. Fraudster ...
excellent service on time
Recently purchased UC marketed Water Purifier top-end model after studying its features. But then installation person did the installation in a disinterested manner. Water started dripping from the bottom of the unit. They assigned the same person to rectify it who simply opened and closed the unit and refixed the unit. However, he was not even prepared to wait and see whether it was leakage has stopped. Soon after he left the unit was found leaking with water.
Worrest service from urban company. I piad 12k. Still my issue was not resolved yet.
Happy service extended
Awesome service üëçüèª
Upset with the service The payment was already done still The AC technician was asking for additional Rs.500 which we refused to pay...i submitted the review about it but no response or follow up from the UC Team
Very bad experience... Urban clap is just a business of fraud and money seeker... No use of its warranty and no helpline number provided anywhere in app ... Very Unprofessional behaviour....
Very costly and most of time the carpenter are not available.
Untrained technician assigned and warranty not working on next day of installation. Technician assigned but all technician not coming someone say I am not installation department someone say I am not hot working with inverter AC. Very poor service. I book installation service after installation showing f6 error. Installation boy say hi Han no idea about this error. I was claimed warranty but no one come and no one responded from UC TEAM.
Pathetic services. Cancelled twice, the service guy did not turn up.
It's totally fraud and unreliable, unprofessional servicing company. Your appliances will be damage, servicing will be done by novice unprofessional agents who are in the phase of learning. My AC get damaged, i raised a complaint, upload image also, sent email, tweet on tweeter, but no response is received. So never ever call urban company.
I took cooler cleaning and khus change service, but the water pump stops working on the same day. Tried to raise the issue in the app, and click on book revist, it take me to a screen saying "somethingwent wrong!" Do not know how to solve the issue
Good
It Makes life easy üòå
Worst experience, the service person called 2hr earlier and wanted to start the service earlier when no one is at home!! But no communication after that, no way to connect UC, worst service.. since we had paid in advance, this is the last time will be using their service. Can spend in retaining customer with better communication and not with only advertisements. Never try..
Good service
Horrible experience, service provider didnt turn up based on scheduled timing and didnt receive full refund promptly. Their call centre agent called to inform that beautician will be late but none turned up after 2hrs of waiting. No update call and unable to contact service provider. Totally waste of my time as I also need to make constant call in order to request for refund. They didnt waive off late charges fee even their provider didnt turn up? Will not recommend.
PATHETIC HARASSMENT I CALL IT YOU PAY THEM TO KEEP HARRASING YOU . THEY TOOK MONEY GAVE ME 12 O CLOCK TUESDAY CLEANING SLOT ITS MORE THAN 30 HOURS THEY HAVEN'T SENT ANYONE ONLY RESCHEDULING OF TIME SLOTE TWICE NO SERVICE. THIS IS WORST EXPERIENCE.
They did deep servicing but didn't check the gas level now AC isn't cooling the room now,horrible service!
Good üëç
Poor service , ineffective redressals of complaints and no refund despite incomplete service
excellent job done
This aap amazing
Very very unprofessional. Not at all reliable.
Not able to make an order.....
Can not navigate to view cart and checkout
There is no quality control on their contractual hires. I and many like me have been duped by their AC repair partners. Their partners duped me of Rs 7500 and damaged my ACs even more than they were before. Highly recommend you all to not use their services.
good work

UC service is very poor and UC tech done my AC service and during the service they replaced some defected products with new product and during the service I was not checked due to brand image. But my request to everyone be aware during the work and after the completion UC will not takcare your problems.
great uc
GOOD INITIATIVE
Such a worst service you will experience with this company..don't use URBAN COMPANY ever..you will regret..no value for the customers and money..better get the same work done by the local skilled workers any help in there growth rather spending money on something which will never gets fix from URBAN COMPANY..I suggest n request to all educated people not to use this app.
This app is not best for you to use. There on December 1st 1:00pm water purifier repaired and now April 6th 5:00 pm again note working . He told that it will work 1 year üíØ percent garentee but now working. No response from them.
UC very very good good
excellent servicing...
Good service
This was a single start feedback but because of the efforts of your CC and the engineer who worked on my service request I am delighted to give you a thumbs-up.
very much satisfied with the service and their technical support.
My issue was resolved by UC team and faulty part replacement claim was reimbursed under UC warranty..
In kolkata their service partners are really good. In Pune also I found the same. They made my life easier.
Pathetic service provided tech came cleaned ac now ac is not working and not even a single person calling back or taking Care of the failure yhe tech seems to be uneducated and no knowledge of the issue.
Unprofessional. My 2 star rating to an untrained professional became 5 star with excellent service.. and my feedback deleted. i wonder how?
Technical people are good
very good
it's good but bit expensive
Worst experience they are taking our money in advance and we have to dance according to their tune
Worst appointment management
perfect experience

I booked intense deep cleaning of 3 bathrooms with advance payment. On the day of booking, a person named Shailendra came and refused to clean the bathrooms saying he can't remove the stains as he was not equipped. Agreeing to his refusal, I asked him to do the normal cleaning but he simply refused and called up a representative of urban company whose name was Rudra. This was really disappointing for me as the app promised deep cleaning but could not even do the normal cleaning.
good
Fake app,in app they will show u one price once the person comes to do our work then they will tell u other price,dnt ever book any professional in this app...all are fake
Very bad experience I got with this urban company that executive is got appointed and nobody visited my place I had to wait the full day ..all my works post poned ..I have asked for the compensation they didn't even satisfied me then what is the use of using such paper companies..
professionalism at its best
Super
Worst customer support
One of the AC cleaned without foam. I heard the same story with my friend. Please equipped technician with adequate quantity of foam.
Economical Prompt Service Good
very good service and very very reasonable. every one can afford
Showing the foam service in tv commercials but foam not available with the staff this was my fist time to deal with UC and it was not up to the mark
excellent service given by Amarjit
Good
Location problem show
Extra charge üëéüëéüëéüëé
Very bad experience for ac deep cleaning service.. I never booked any more for urban company they send unprofessional persons.. And its a totally waste of money..
Good service
I have done my AC servicing through Urban Company. I am very happy with the service. Technician is well behaved and have knowledge.
Worst service. Never trust this company. They made you promise but won't keep it
Mr.Prakash work is very exordinary. very excellent service
Good service
Best App for all your Household Prblms
Nice
In the name of repair, they only suggest for replacement of parts and charge huge amount. If anyone wanted to replace the component then why would they call urban company, why not to get it replaced from the company who is making the product
Pathetic service
Very Efficient Person. Very Good Service.
service is really good!!
Worst service.. The AC service was pathetic... There was no difference after jet cleaning we had to call our regular technician again to clean it as there was so much of dirt ..
Team of well trained technicians makes repair/installation job very easy and convenient.
excellent
very best service service
Reason of giving this is that despite update I am not able to access my bookings option , I have a scheduled booking for 3 pm and I am still not able to see any details of it..this is disgusting and annoying
They just keep on rescheduling the loop goes on and on ! Why spend so much money on advertising if you do not have enough professionals for work . It has happend to me more than 5 times i have booked their service ,time comes i recieve a call from them we cannot find a professional rescedule the service and the loop continues. I now regret buying their membership as it is of no use if they do not have professionals to do the work . Do not depend on them they will definitely disappoint .
Plumbering Servies zirkpur trycity

This app promises delivery on door step whenever you need. It's understandable that under festival season or weekends dur to high demand it's difficult to get slots but on a weekday with no festival season they have accepted the booking and not delivered the service stating there are no professionals available. Very disappointed
efficient sincere and soft spoken
good
Worst service ever, i had booked for my offoce work(need AC service for my Office), they scheduled booking and after that the guy who was coming to my place cancelled booking for his some personal reason. After few time i got call from call center and they were saying that, " sorry sir we dont take bookings for Offices". * and its not informed in application, while booking. Thing is that, just one day before i had booking for plumber at same location, with same contact number and that
Not taking proper action to resolve customer's issues...
Good
Rates are too high in comparison to market standards
Many minor tasks are done at ease. Labour's are skilled an support is tremendous. Thanks,
very good service
Reliable people.
OTP never recieved.... Uninstalling
Very good service
Good service
Very bad experience
Worst!!!!! There is nobody to pickup call or resolve the issue!
neat and clean service
Overwhelming professionalism
Always say experts are busy at location
This is 3rd class experience with your service. I've been trying to book a technical for washin machine repair but you guys are not able to find technician. And, you guys are sending me text like "Dear Customer, We tried to contact you for your complaint regarding our service, however we could not get through. We will again call you in the next 2 hours. For an early callback, we request you to reach out to us via our helpcenter:" I have been getting call from whole world but you guys couldn't
You are give 6days after service for ac thats not good at all
Bad service, waiting technician from yesterday. Now customer call center person is saying that no technician is available till tomorrow. Wasted my 2 days time. Very bad service.. Return my cancellation refund charges. Which you have cancelled.
Pathetic UI. Poor service. Rude technician. Avoid this at all cost. Waiting for refund after cancelling membership. Zero stars rating.
Mr S.Khan and his colleague did the AC cleaning professionally. They were very well behaved.
Excellent service overall
it's Really good
One of the worst service, never book tecnicians for A.C, washing machine or fridge or even barber. They dont knw anything. U cant belief them for repair. Cleaning they can do. Rest they r poor quality technicians. I lost 10k rs coz f them
Excellent service.
Wrour ever
Their AC service guy damaged my washing machine during the AC external unit service. Urbancompany shows an option to register a complaint on these grounds, and I've done it thrice, but no response still.
Only two service available in Udaipur
The app shows different price, the agent quotes other. AC installation with the 15w socket comes for 700+ gst and the guy quotes 1800 on your face. The wiring is included in the package yet they ask to change the wiring ( what the heck was the previous wire than? ) bloody hell so many unprofessional agents.
Overpriced one assist is offering 100 rs less for ac service.
Worst service provider.Despite of raising complaint no one has contacted for past 7 days.Very much unprofessional company and its not Urban Company.
Great app
I booked for salon services yesterday for April 6th and I have my flight on same day and was expecting for things to run smoothly but you have worst service when it comes to respond or convey the information quickly and beautician still not assigned. Worst service guys had too much hopes from you and I hope to get my refund back asap
They are cheaters that is what i can say the least. For my TV repair where only one led tv strip was replaced and they charged 4√ó price, stating that cost is different. Ideally, they should have either updated their price list or have given me at the cost of one which they have actually replaced
good
Very unprofessional and bakwas.
I have experienced one of the worst service provider till date almost 20 day completed but issue not resolved, even after payment done.
Good
Initially I gave 5 star rating but now I am changing to 1 star, reason is since I have taken membership, I am not able to book person for gyser service. Just 2 weeks ago one person visited to Gyser inspection. He cleaned and fitted as it is. I was happy that, so Simple to resolve issue. After 2 weeks gyser stopped working, now when I am trying to book professional since last 1 week, It says, service in area is not available, whereas I stay in pune, and UC has already done couple of jobs.
All services have become luxurious and expensive
100% satisfied with the work
Thank youüôèüôè
I didn't liked this app...completely useless and not user friendly
Functinal AC is now not working after Deep clean, pls rectify
I am using urban company from the past 2 to 3 years at the starting the prices was good and affordable, but now the charges are overpriced.
the word done was excellent
Horrible customer service, responded in a bad language in the chat. Very poor service and disrespectful. This is the first time in my life where I experience disrespectful reply from customer service. Not recommended at all üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
Worse,burglers,ac repairing fellows has stolen my iPhone.i complained in urban but no response.bloody thrives. Abigail loss for me.and those fellows r very clever.shame on urban company
Good
When this app's service will start in my district dewas
This application is not working properly,while opening it shows something went wrong message
Never avail services through this app. The damaged my AC during service and not responding to my repeated requests. They offer warranty upto 10000/- for any damages but its fraud.
Service provided for repairingLG TV through Sharma Electronics. Within six months malfunctio ing observed, repaired but within 15 days the TV was down again. First service charges approx 9000.00. Sharma electronics asked further 3500.00 to repair. Got the TV checked by LG service engineer and the report does not match with Sharma Electronics. Did Urban company checked the credential of Sharma Electronics before deputing them?
Why is it so difficult to get in touch with you'll whether it's through email or phone no reply on email no guidance as to how to make a phone call to customer service rent you'll repeated emails..

Nice.
Professional and quality service given by urban clap. Very satisfied with each service given by them. Love alot the free vedio consultation. I am Always recommending uc to all my knowns. Thanks urban clap.
So unprofessional!! They block your account for just changing professional for multiple times. They doesn't care how much services you have takwn before, if you change professional multiple time they just block your account.. No value for customers.
Very honest and reliable professionals.
Excellent
Good one
Ac service Request cancelled by them and charge from us
No services are there where I live!
Poor attitude towards work
Professional are not interested in repairing the appliances. They say's better buy new appliance rather than getting the appliance fix as the cost of repair is too high. This happened twice with me. More over one professional asked for cash for investigating the issue and asked me to cancel the booking. I wasted my money and time after installing urban company app. pathetic experience overall.
Good service
All options are not available and customer service is not good
good service
service is amazing
Good service, but no sufficient tools, no safety hat or helmet, no safety shoes, no safety and proper rudder.
p sha'Dropular
Worst experience, don't go for their a/c service
Recently the salon service took from UC has turn into a nightmare. So, UC please test the products before keeping on your page. I am not mentioning the exact issue just because of one incident i can't defame the brand. So kindly get in touch as it's really not acceptable from a service provider like you.
Most unprofessional team i have ever faced they just send any random guy for service he destroys items of ur house and company didn't say any word to them and those guys also charge false amount to you a big big no to them better to go and find in a local market .
Can't get otp
Superb. Very professional
The professional are not at all well trained and acknowledged of the product. They lack very basic requirements to figure out the problem in the appliance even after several visits.
Nice and clean work
good app for good service!
Time waste app
very professional
Very unfair pricing compared with advertising and un professional behavior with customers I don't recommend this app for your services
overall I am satisfied with the service.One think I must say that the used chemicals must be some kind of acid which may corrode the marble.

Excellent work by urban company
Got call from urban co. For refund process but fake promises and never got amount and not the proper service.Worst technician and service by him. Ll never book again ever on urban company. You don't know how to manage business.
Good
professional service. cleaned tougest strains in the bathroom. professional and polite attitude of the person who attended the call. Great ease !!!
too expensive. Did nit fins huge difference from local sevice provider. However, price differnce is huge.
superb work, feel too good
Overcharge accessories of appliances. I have got a fridge repaired, and the charges for new thermostat was 2X of what you get in the market or online. In case of my RO water level cut-off switch, they charged 299, whereas the market rate is 150-180. Would understand if they were installed at these much higher rates, included the installation charges, but there is separate service charges. I'd rather call my local plumber/carpenter/electritian instead from next time. No fault of service ppl.
good work
Nice service
they had come for ac repair and service there was just a issue of condenser and the technisian gave a bill of 11000 in whoch he included 5500 condenser copper wire 2mtr but the copper wire was absolutely fine and also when we told that we will bring the item you vhange he refused to do so and also after that i told him to only change the condenser and he refused to do that also and said that it is against the rule so basically he just wanted a bill of 11000 nothing else this is not good urbanc.
Worst experience ever. I book for intense deep cleaning bathroom for 1pm. But even after 1pm I couldn't reach the professional guy they assigned he was not picking the call nor reply to message. After that I went to Help desk in the app and I was told I will get a call back from UC customer care but they never did that as well. And for refund of the booking I made it took 7days. Horrible service horrible experience
Company is misleading people by telling that shine lasts for 2 months.... Products ur sending r very mild...no stain was removed on tiles. Not satisfied with ur products
I booked for bathroom cleaning.service can be improved.
Worst service, not assigning technician properly on time, unable contact customer service didn't get call back as well Useless service providers.
Good
Will going to file complaint in Consumer Forum for damaging my air conditioner and not responding.
499 rs is a myth, wrong information in add
App needs feature to make Tips payment online after service completion.
very nice neatly thank you
Poor metiral providing (repaing motor providing &Amount taken new motors)
Price of the spare parts are overpriced at an unexpected level. They are charging so high for the spare parts it's really disappointing to cheat customers in such manner. They are spoiling our trust, technician are available doesn't mean they will charge for the parts like this.
delay on attending
good
I had booked yesterday and got my booking today next time please make sure you don't make customers wait even after booking.
Super efficient and easy service experience
Very nice
good
Great service... spa was awesome
excellent job
registered a complaint 3 days ago with them but no response from their side so far ..very unprofessional and disappointing..
Illiterate technician.....no minimum qualification for any technician........any person is allowed to work as technician in this company without knowing it's talent and dexterity
The app has an issue where you can't make online payment post service and customer is forced to do cash payment and on other side company guarantees an insurance only on online payment. Its an open fraud by Urban Company. Infact its showing incorrect balance in my Paytm wallet so that i cant make online payment.
Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid
I was very happy with the app initially, but sadly, offlate they dont seem to assign professionals at your required time slot and have the audacity to call an hour or 2 before the slot to tell that professional is not available( salon service). They accept your payment well in advance (2 or 3 days before) and cant seem to find a professional in time for your service. I doubt they even have any professional with them now.
URBAN COMPANY IS THE BEST SUPERB SERVICE... :)
As their is no option to give 0 star to them so i have to give 1 star anyway i don't recommend anyone to service/repair AC from urban company.Even after two visit they are not able to service my LG Window AC(2019 Model) and are not refunding my money.I feel cheated from this thieves because my hard earned money has been looted by this so called urban company.I recomend not to take their service for Repairing/servicing AC .Zero customer support,non professionlism only trying to thug pepole.
Terrible experience with Carpenter booking. Carpenter that showed up was causing issues which was escelated & rescheduled. On rescheduled date carpenter was not assigned at all & UC cancelled the booking. Support team just suggested that I need to book the services on own, once again. Is that the customer service we are supposed to expect? You are just leaving customers with no resolution at all & closing tickets. Awful! Awful experience!!
good
Always got a good service..No complains till date..Happy to have urban company
excellent work
Great work with full of transparency
Pathetic service with no proper update about the bookings. Wasted 3 days of precious time waiting for AC servicing which got rescheduled twice. Would not recommend it to anyone or use it myself in future.
I need a contact number to explain the issue from our side.
service was very good
Can I Give Zero Star I have booked an appointment for AC service, 4th April 2022 slot 10:30 AM. And now it is 5th April still haven't received service. Mailing them from yesterday contacting CS no satisfactory answer from them. Very much disappointed from UC. Will recommend not to use this APP. Fooling customer is their main moto. Charged me full with additional convenience fee also. Still not work accordingly.
I have been trying to get a callbak from UC for the past days. Is it so hard to call? My experience of UC pre-sales has not been good. Your app says you are offering no cost EMI for water purifiers. But during checkout I see no such option.
there is no advance payment options for customer. this needs to improve.
I booked a deep clean AC service but the professional didn't use the cleaning foam. I complained in the customer care and they said they will give a resolution and they haven't given any yet. It's been 2 weeks.
I have assigned a service with their booking time, they didn't call after booking, at the reserved time they called me and saying we don't have team can we do it tomorrow. Then why this app showing booking slots
Worse app...
Very bad experience I got book Ac service but unfortunately no one come or no-one call from urban company they don't have much employee. please urban company be professional otherwise you destroying company name & reputation.
easy to book, competitive prices, and great partners! highly recommend :)
convenient to book and professional services.
Without my permission this app reading my msg like OTP , Android sucksüòÇüòÇ
The best service
A.c.Service was gud..fully satisfied with the way the work was done with utmost sincerity .gud experience
I have book foam ac servicnng but the servicing doesn't look like what they show in the videon photos previous
All is ok.. Even if may be take some less price for cleaning...but staring to ens all is good...
Very bad experience I booked for full home cleaning service. 1st person who was assigned cancelled the service at the last movement Again 2nd person who was assigned cancelled again last movement and they assigned the service and guys who had come for cleaning didn't even do anything house was messed up and we had clean it and it's waste of time and money please don't book ur maid can clean whole house in 500rs. 4 people came did nothing for 3500.at the end they forced me for 5 star
Really charges are very high and services are also not well, I suggest you do not go to this guys for any repair.
Gud
Dhanalakshmi did a good job but I felt her bit fussy, she started the bathroom is in a very bad shape ( I know it's not so cose we regularly clean by ourselves- only for salt deposits I called UC). She wanted plug for the machine nearby v don't have. I said I can provide extension cord. She denied stating it will give shock (?). So the machine cleaning in 2 nd bathroom was not done! End product is good, low marks for BR 2. Next time I will not prefer this person. Thanks
Really Really Bad experience. They are rescheduling booking again and again and there is no professional available with them. They are just torchering people. And in case there professional is available and booking is of 10 AM .. They'll come at 12 PM .and then start giving excuses maam I was not getting cab this and that.. and then they will complete your services really fast and will not give complete time ... Not at All Recommended... Very bad company and App.
Excellent
I had very worst customer support experience during my last ac service
Before urbanclap company is very good and good service and giving to technician benefit but now finish company
Totally. 0
Not good experience with ELECTRONICS. Water droplets started falling after AC service.
Horrible AC service, pathetic customer service No call back from customer care after multiple requests...AC technician has damaged my AC and urban complex is not providing any solution...I'll definitely fight for appropriate actions against them!
Excellent Service By Urban Clap
Excellent service .
Excellent
Excellent app, professional staff will recommend to everyone
I am so happy because urban company patner
Negligent attitude in refund for canceled bookings and no SMS or mail confirmation also no reference for refund enquiry. It doesn't qualify for single star.
Worst service no one has turnd out for the service and I paid for it even before the service. Very disappointing talking with Mr.Bahadur customer support...he says there are no professionals at all and there is no garantee that the professional will attend the job for any of the service from urban company. I will never use this app again and will not recommend any one to use it.
servicing of ac by urban company is far superior than authorized agency which is provided by companies in first year.
It's totally useless app since 4 days they are asking me to reschedule and till now I didn't get any service done when I cancelled the service 300 was deducted
Third class app, first they booked the service and when professional not available they cancel your order automatically. Further there is big issue in refunding the money. I am trying from one month but till date they have returned the money. Dont use this app, worst service
good
Very very bad
No response from your professional...
Great Service
Great experience
good
UC Has to improve quality of products for Manicure and Pedicure .Standard brands preferred ! LAKME,VLCC etc .Not cheap ones never heard of ! So too Nail polishes ! I was disppointed ..
I am following up for the past three days for spoiling my washroom floor. There is no support so far. They offered to refund charges I paid but not to rectify the problem. Please don't use services where there is risk of damage to your property.
Very dangerous to use Urban company services...be careful..if you choose any simple service, you loose expensive items at home. Once lost, no way you will get it back.
Excellent and marvellous
Useless App. All services are non reliable and extremely expensive. Outside market rates are much cheaper and better customer dealings. They have hidden charges and always provide services as their own convinience and time. The professional are also amateurs without any knowledge.
Awful experience. Awful customer service. Despite paying for the service in advance, can't contact customer care and on lodging a complaint, nobody calls back.
Recommended
Why have cooler repair services been withdrawn by urban company ?? Ridiculous!!
Not very responsive. In case of bad services, they fail to respond
Poor service
Wrost experience here technician has not arrived after booking
Typically this app asked to connect internet inspite being well plced on wifi
good
Bekar ap h Ak dam meri friend ne bataya h
Company have no control on their labours. App shows different rates and labour wants different rates , Boths rates are not match with market rates. Urban labours are shows that they are the boss of company they decide the rates of service directly with customers.
No use of plus membership so useless to take it, as they first discounts only on service booked not on repairs, secondly they charge seperately for service/booking charges, which should be free for members. If you get repairs done it's expensive and warranty given are less than market standards. I recently got my AC service and gas refill done. Gas refill are expensive and warranty given only for 60 days, however nearby shops and other online websites charges less and give 90 days warranty.
Booked & paid for AC service on 2.4.2022, professional came, and inspite of telling to wait he left for other job, promising to come back later in the day. It's been 3 days, he is not even receiving my calls. It's highly unprofessional of Urban Company.
Great professionals onboard. Great experience for the last 3 years for the services I opted. Every year outstandng experience they deliver.
Try to add some mehendi artists too.. would be of great helpüòÄ
I mean, the prices, the people and the process. One of the best creations of 21st century üî•
Not able to booking.. i tried from past 2weeks.. every time its shows professional unavailable.. its shows msg like "notify when slots are available".. but still no i didnt get any notification.
Not providing proper services, professionals are also not experienced, worst experience for AC servicing. Support team is never respond on your issues. Never received any help.
Nice job
ok ok... not so... good cleaning....
DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR CREDIT CARD DETAILS. THEY WILL CHARGE YOU WITHOUT PERMISSION. AND WHEN YOU CALL THEM AND ASK THEM FOR REFUND THEY JUST REPEAT THE SAME SENTENCE OVER AND OVER (THAT ITS NOT POSSIBLE) AS IF YOU ARE TALKING TO AN OUTDATED AUTISTIC ROBOT
Good
Extremely unprofessional attitude. I availed of service for my AC back on 18/03/22, as there was issues the same needed to be re-serviced on 26/03/22. On 28/03/22 problem with AC still persists. I again requested for service through app. Every time only prompt appears that i will get a call back from your team within next 15 minutes. But no call, today is 04/04/22, why there is no request id given to my complain? How long should my family be fried in this torrid summer without my AC?
prompt service
Very unprofessional
Awesome experience!!
Good and speedy response
best engineer best work, keep it up. it was beyond my expectation.
Unprofessional towards booking... Not good as they claim to be.. Poor customer service as well
Unprofessional services my didn't like the way they cut the hair
little bit price High... but ok as per quality
Pathetic and worst experience ever.. I booked the slot for ac service for 04/04/2022. They called me and told that no technical person is available for next 24 hours. If you don't have any technical person available, why do you keep slot live?
Worst Service. There is no way we can reach customer care.
Good
Accepted for AC service.. but no response from them.. no intimation from them.. cancelled the service with out proper comnunication.
I choose Women salon at home the company wrongly charge me 300 rs . I booked Cut file & leg polish and they did nail polish. Go and ask any parlors that what is the difference between polishing nail and polishing leg . And now don't want to refund my amount .
Don't go for AC service. They will mess with the AC and then say there is no cooling gas. Then charge 2700 for cooling gas. DONT EVER USE THEIR SERVICE.
Third class
ok
The worst customer service... I made a payment online and they confirmed to the technician that I dint make a payment and had yo pay twice.. and no response since one week .. they are taking double payment
Got service done 5ac, your team tried to cheat for ac gas. Which was not required, creditability has been degraded, date incident. M 401 SISPAL VIHAR SECTOR 49 GURGAON. appropriate action against THE team is in pipe line.
Good, Till date
Pathatic never opt this platform
Efficient service

Quick service and excellent worked .
Very worst service in Ranchi. Please do not book any service from urban company. I have booked for A/c servicing on 31st March but till 4 th April I will not get service.
No need to wait for local technicians and entertain their whims anymore. Professional service, behaviour, language guaranteed.
I think guys are not professional they are forget the important item use in service they are doing temporary work.
excellent relaxing massage by jigar
Good work
Rate is high.voucher is not applicable.
I have been trying to reach urban clap but no response from them. Their person cancelled the booking and now they are charging me 50 rupees on cancellation. Pls be aware of such scams. They are scamming people.
Urban company is charging more than double the MRP for spare parts.
excellent
Thanks for expanding the services to Bhopal.
Untrusted service
Very unprofessional people. Booked a AC service. Technician came and asked to cancel the appointment as it's a revisit and will affect his rating. So being generous i cancelled. He charged me 2000/ for the parts and visit. Next day itself AC stopped working. After escalation a new technician was assigned on 1st April, who didn't visited then on 2ndApril 2022, who also didn't visited. No response from urban clap team. Feeling cheated.
These people taking more then a month to resolve my issue, still waiting
good
good
Not good now
Worst experience, The technician made my working ac worse. Urban clap has worst customer service. Not recommended at all.
Customer care is not reachable easily , also not providing services on time, kindly look into it
Worst ever service. Very much disappointed from such a company. I have taken amc and is since 15 days no body is bother to inspect the appliances This people are greedy only for money. Once you pay they don't bother for the service. Is it your commitment Companies policy to refund the amount after the customer sue you. Pls check your company policy and reply me. So that my lawyer can send you court notice ASAP.
Better not to pick this app for any such help. If you just go out of your house and search for people to finish your work, they will be more professional. I had bad experience with all 3 services I booked from them.
I had booked deep cleaning with foam technology but all he did was wash it with water with a pump besides I was charged 650
Worst no response from urban company. Don't book for appliance warranty for 12 months. Once amount goes to their account no one is responded.
Refund not received
Great Services.. Thanks.
Very bad service, if there is a option for zero star then that will be best option for this company ...

Charges very high
Very nice crevice
Third class not working app
Not good experience with Urban Company for AC servicing.
I'm truly satisfied I strongly recommend people must try once from urban company so that they can understand the how customer centric company it is . great job
Pathetic experience... The executive has not completed his service which was mentioned in the description and also forced to give him 5 star rating as he was not leaving the premise.. The executive have not done scrub and massage which was included in the pack and said the same was not included... Very pathetic service.. the guy name was Kiran nayi
Best app for services.
Good Service
Worst experience they hire un professionals here no proper customer care support. I didnt like the professional I reschedule 4 times they were sending the same professional as if the other professionals are not available urban company are not concern abt their customer needs they waste our valuable time and money waste of installing their app I dnt recommend to anyone
Nice app
Poor service at premium price. Not worth
I had asked for inverter repair and AC servicing. Only inverter technician visited and did a good job. AC technician did not turn up
Very pricy and worst service. Washing machine started to malfunction within 2 days and when i brought in Samsung company service men, he said a basic setup is not performed correctly.
Good team work
excellent service
nice
Waste app not a single service provider not available in my area
Did not get the estimate and the service was started. Customer service said issue with the app.
They are making fool to people
pathetic. how could you cancel the service at the final moment without my consent.
My wife is trying to book makeup packages that included hairstyling before n also some other makeup packages are missing which im trying to book but couldn't find them .plz show them on app asap
Very costly
A.
The worst service and experience ever with Urban Company in Visakhapatnam, AP, India. Would have provided zero stars if possible. They rescheduled twice because their staff didn't turn up for the bookings. I spent all my time and efforts in coordinating with them which is no use. I would not recommend Urban Company because of their poor service and not showing up at the scheduled time. Please stay away.
Good
In last two months, I made two bookings for two different things and in two different cities and both the time you didn't assign the tech at all. No communication or anything. Time totally wasted. No way to reach your customer care. You only take my number and never call me back. Literally a harassment service app. Rating it 0 stars.
perfect service & cooperative
Your guy came for cleaning and has broken my jhoomer and fused microwave and now not picking up my calls If your guy not going to come back and replace all this, I will file a complaint against you guys for damaging my property
Good
I had booked a service which I unable to avail but before I could ask they refunded the amount . Thanks a lot !!
The company are charging more and the service is not upto the mark
Zero ratings Very very unprofessional customer service Very rude behavior No customer care no No one will give you services even in Delhi Location
the therapist, the method, the equipment was all excellent.
Good
awesome service
very nice behaviour and nice
Totally unprofessional
Good experience and proper resolution to our problems
The assigned professional did not turn up even after 40 minutes past booking time. Had to cancel as there was no way of knowing when he will turn up. There seems to no effort on part of UC to set this right, all they do is keep making empty promises..
Very very poor service, timing is not important for them, customer care service doesn't support at all.
Excellent service with reasonable rates
Takes too long to get a service booked.
No one from customer care calls you even after raising multiple requests. Bought their 1-year membership plan 15 days ago at 300 rs and have scheduled atleast 5 services but no professional got assigned. And no way to connect to any customer care executive. Pathetic service. Pathetic experience. Please shut down your operations if you cannot deliver üôè
Very Late / Delayed Service.
perfect jobüëå
Great
Not upto mark. I paid Rs. 599 for Servicing of Split AC on 01.04.22 which was marked for refund of only Rs. 449. On enquiry it was informed that remaining amount may be utilized for next booking. Without my consent and without informing me Rs. 150 were reserved for next bookings and there is nobody to resolve my issue. I am taking up the matter continuously since 01.04.22 through email with No response.
really best and great..
Nice app User friendly . Highly recommended üëç
The services rendered were very good and also the technicians provided were very polite and skilled... after completing their work they fixed everything and also cleaned the area well... pretty impressive...
One of worst service. Very bad professionals they are having , even booking is quite bad and none of theirs professionals follow the schedule. Please don't go for UC service.
Its about services provided. The AC technician broke AC and even after struggling 10 days its just pathetic responses and irresponsible/unprofessional behavior from support team. Dont fall prey to their warranty/claim promises, they don't keep then but will pass ball here and there.
Quite reasonable in pricing and technicians skills. I have got servicing through private technicals as well but the Urban Company partnered technicals are far more skilled and professional than anyone else. Also found UC service partners very efficient and effective. It helps to have the equipments well maintained and longer life.
good
good work. polite team members
Very useful app
Nice service
good service.. excellent work..
Rating screen should not appear immediately after the job completion. What's the point in giving 5 star rating infront of technician. Who will give 1 or 2 star infront of him. It should appear in the app after half an hour after completion of work.
Agent cancelled the booking 2 hours after the assigned booking time i.e. 12pm. Professional was supposed to come at 12pm, he made us wait till 2:00 pm, replying us that he is at some other place, and cancelled the booking at 2:00pm. And he mentioned the reason that customer no longer require the service. I used service from urban co. two times, and both of the time I faced same problem. I even purchased plus membership. This is totally absurd. No one even calls from the company.
After 3 days service ....There is a problem ....AC not cooling. Call raised .. Engineer was already want some extra .....Let c how urban takle this situation and what they need extra income. Waiting service engineer excuses ...Gas nikal gyi ...Compressor kharab hai .....Etc to take extra charge.
Worst service too late
Worst experience. They don't have professionals available then also they show empty slots on the app. Rescheduled the deep cleaning service that I booked 2times and then cancelled it. Never going to use this app again.
Excellent services provided by Ms. Reshma.I loved the face massage. Thoroughly professional.
Give your services in meerut also...
Great worksmanship. Thoroughly professional with exemplary behaviour.
Even after raising issues on UC... There is no contact from their side... I don't have any number to contact your helpline.. If you don't call, the customer is helpless.
Kitchen cleansing was perfect
Unprofessional service, raised request many time but not call a single time. Only changing time and professional also not cooperating
Low experienced technician. Problem did not solve. I paird for the all as wel as the technician too. Still my motor didn't work
Their advertisement of timely service is all fake. You keep on waiting and no one is bothered to update about delay
It doesnt even deserve 1 star ... The worst platform.. deleting the app and would never use it again
UrbanClap has given a good platform for frauds where they would fool the customers to mint money. there is no gaurantee that ur professional is going to be genuine and will actually resolve the issue. Booking a Chimney deep cleaning service via urban clap was a mistake and it wasted alot of my time. Use UC at your own risk.
Excellent and Superb. "Warranty means Warranty" which they are following with excellent, that's the superb thing from urban company. very happy for urban company servicesüëåüëå
Good
Excellent service
i have booked at 11.30 am, why wait to technician for 2 pm, too long wait..my time wasted
Great services at doorstep
Pathetic service. They themselves rescheduled your booking and professional never comes on time. 3 times this behavior has happened
You guys are overcharging and not providing any warrenty. I better switch to local ac technician rateher than you scammers.
good job manish k for servicing my aircon and providing tips and alternates
awesome service
Excellent service
Its a one stop solution of any essential houshold repair job on emergency basis. Rest tension free with UC service.
There best service
These people close the complaint without resolving the issue and let the people call and querral with you. Please see professional rating and comments before accepting the booking....mine was terrible and had bad remarks but I thought to give a chance but she was like always and was terrible. The UC is not even resolving the issue. Improve your self you are in public service portal. Don't fool us after taking our hard earned money. Too bad....
Very bad service better to get local service... On the name of professinals they will send thiefs who can take anything or everything from ur house..without asking.
Worst Service and demaged my AC.Requested Re Visite and Assigned professional and urban company not responding.simey they looting public money
I booked ac service for 2 air conditioner. Paid for the service in advance a week ago. No executive came to service my ACs. No one called me about the delays. I even raised issues on App, but not response from UC team. This is really very unprofessional. Added: i was then asked by UC calling guy to cancel by booking. And rebook again.Now the prices are increased by 50%. What rubbish os this. I recently got a review message from UC. I tried to rate this 3 out of 10. But website is not allowing.
No response and responsibility by anyone
Very good service.
Most unprofessional behaviour by the company and the service professional
Very dangerous to avail facial services. Nose completely spoiled due to unprofessional service. You will end up in hospital consultation
excellent

update me about any discounts
Amazing service
Nice app
Excellent respond and helpfull information
Worst Service I have book my ac service i was unsatisfied with service, so book revise service then professional told he ll nt come, so uc assign another professional bt before 5 minutes of booking time he called n told that he ll nt come, so i request to refund my amount bt now they say they can't refund amount, worst service ever seen. I would negative - 5 star for rating
nice person ,did great job , explain everything.I am a happy customer. Thanks sabir
Very much professional and timely service.
Worst n expenses too they send local machines to do the job nornaly the same mechnic done same job in half charges
Very helpfull
This is just to loot your hard earned money , they don't have control over the professional coming to service at your place ...They just keep looting the service charges from your end Don't go for it they are not worth 1 star also
Please drop some price
Worst app I have done AC service for today 11Am Now it's 11:30 and till now technician is not even assigned yet, tried to raised complaint not able to connect with them neither there team is contact however I have raised the complaint 1 hour ago Worst service @Urban_company Will post the same on social media about this that how they made fool the customer by showing ads and once customer booked appointment on pre payment and they disappear. #worst services #fraud by urban company #money_stealer
Nice and easy app to use...Also the staffs are professional and polite..kudos to UC
Never use this app it's a fraud one and the company give u no good service but makes the situation even worse
good excelent work
I booked two jet foam service for ACs, but the executive have not used any foam as mentioned in the service details
Truly professional
Pathetic experience as I had booked full house cleaning services twice and no professionals were assigned within the time frame mentioned. Not going to book any services. You can keep my 250rs membership fee as a tip.
Very good
Highly unprofessional, scheduled services get canceled without information.
Pathetic services. Merging address of Hyderabad with Delhi multiple times. Unable to resolve the issue.
awesome
No customer support, booking scheduled not serviced
No professional has been assigned to me till the requested time .. will never use this app again.waste of time .

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE !!! They haven't assigned me any professional and there's no way we can call them. The only way to reach out to them is to just put a query and wait for them to call!!!! Horrible and pathetic experience
Not reliable at all. Booked pest control week before and paid online, waited till service time but no professional assigned. So cancelled the booking and got it done by local pest control with prompt service. Basically avoid urbanclap they lack professionalism and not reliable at all.
I had updated my address on the app. They were cancelling my booking multiple times saying professional can't deliver the service. I had the worst experience and this is not acceptable at all.
bad experience..
good
my expirience was really good for app as well as service. Booking was quick and easy and A.C servicing was good as well.
Not Able to buy Appliance Protection Plan and no call back from customer service since last 2 weeks
Verry poor feed back reply no support
It was Great Service by Team Urbam Company
The rating is not for the app but the people who are running the show. They are least bothered about customer experience.
Expecting lower price than local service centre
Cannot trust for AC service from the company like UC, without service completion they have charged me ‚Çπ 348 as visit charge. As a customer I am unhappy, request for refund my hard earned money or do complet the job. Till then no rating..
The worst and the horrible experience ever.Completely disappointed and what is disgrace you people are bringing to all the service providing apps? I booked a bathroom cleaning service and the person assigned came and refused to clean because he wanted me to upgrade the package for no reason and when I said you provide me the service which is included in my package he simply refused to even touch the bathroom and now urban company is not even giving me a call back after raising request many times
excellent
Great and seamless services
Good Appüëç
Very useful app
Extremely poor quality AC technicians are sometimes deputed without skill checking.
Very bad experience with the service and commitment of this company
till now my experience was very good and workmanship is better in all ways
Awesome app to get various services done.
Hii all, please do not take service from Urban Company, they are doing fraud with you, they are taking money membership showing professional, but thenafter they will say professional is not available and you will not get your membership money back, so please take care they are doing cheating with peoples, save your money and do not take sarvice from these people
Booked for a c service first time, booking slit was 8.30 am but no technician arrived on time , being asked he that he will be late by half an hour, later it was found that booking was cancelled,it's embarrassing. Very poor experience very first time. Thank you urban company
Bed my was not work üòû and no response any from company
I have booked for AC servicing. The issue is still persist and infact it's worsen now. Raised complaint with UC but no response even after multiple follow-ups
Service itself is usually good, but the app has glitches and can be difficult to navigate or terminates itself. It's also difficult to modify bookings as you have to reselect each service, rather than just being able to remove or change one item (eg. to remove the fridge clean I have to start over rather than just cancelling that one item).
Your agent taking Rs 200 more . Except Rs. 548. For different issues
Toooo much expensive Amir logo k chochle hai
AC Service is okaish like any other ac service but one thing fraudulent they have is they promise one month insurance after the service which is completely baseless. No one will have a more genuine issue with the ac within 10 days of service than I have and I didn't got any benifits of the insurance upon that was asked for rs 2700 upon revisit . Just stick to ac service don't promise free insurance if company can't afford it.
Worst AC service dne by urban After servicing of AC My AC is sounding
Useless never on time......... Better get all service locally...... They do not deserve any star actually..... Rubbish customer help..... They are not in mood to call any one afyer infoming that i did not recd any call after my due time is over even after 4 hours..... Bloody hell....... No more words just to say..........immediate uninstall this rubbish app from ur phone
Very bad exprience i booked for washin machine repair last 3 day . they wer saying that we have not expert right now for doing this job .if you have not avel to do the service why you are running your business . Sutdown your aplication and bisiness
Updated the rating post response from customer care : While I am satisfied related to services provided , customer care needs major improvement along with updates to be given to customer in case of cancellations. As you are charging cancellation fee for customer with in 2hrs it your responsibility to inform on cancellation from your end also on time with reason.
Excellent service and we'll professional staff
No proper solution after paid rs. 3500/-.
Not gd application
Bad bad bad bad üëé üòë üòê üòí üò´ üëå üëé üòë
After booking was done the booking was automatically declined.... Such a worst app I have never seen it before
Very bad customer service Maid did not come after booking wasted my time nor did the bother to inform tht she wouldn't be coming Would never recommend this app
I booked a cleaner. She never arrived. When called she says she is still.in her previous job. Such a waste of time. Sloppy work and job. If you guys cannot accommodate your customers well then why spend money in marketing this n that. I am VERY disappointed..I waited for her and even cancelled my even plans. Screwed up Urban Clap!
excellent
i didnt get any cash back . executive didnt properly guided .
My Ac got completely ruined after the Ac servicing by this pathetic app. Unable to contact the customer care services.
Very very bad and pathetic service. The service technician did not came on time. All the big big words of commitment and service by the company is just fake. If someone doesn't value the time its just unprofessional. Worse experience. I will never use it in future. There are other options in the market available.
services are very expensive
. Recent ac service review They are showing ac condenser copper very cheap than market price. I have to buy it my self at higher price which is 2000 more than a quoted and UC did not provide me any condenser.
excellent service
Excellent service done by Prince di great
Professional services, overall satisfied. Only issue is professionals sometimes come late than allotted slot.
V convenient
Book your service ..they will sell you their membership also ...now the game will start ..till last moment they will fail to provide you service...after that.. you will get a message "our team will call you"...but you will not get any call...no direct contact procedure...just trap...it's better to contact nearby local shops. Most of the genuine users have given 1 star so book any service after reading feedbacks....
best pricing
service technician done a wonderful job and highly coperative
No technician available for any kind of service since last 20 days..
I don't understand the purpose of this app. It is not working at all.
Poor experience with Urban Company services.
Very good service.
Very professional in their services, I am fully satisfied. Easy to book and pay through the app. Lot of packages available to select from. Overall a good experience.
Most unprofessional persons they provide. I will never recommend to anyones
Oline service ki job bahut hi bekaar hoti hai Client ek minute me kisi ki mahino ki mehnat ko kharab kar deti hai
Their so called high rated technicians do not confirm the booking so easily and acts as per their own availability or even cancel the booking themselves without stating reasons and the booking automatically passes over to less experienced technicians which makes the experience not user friendly.
good job..
Pathetic experience with unprofessional team members.Product damaged but there was no one for perfect service..Not expected from Urban Company
well done
Don't use any service from Urban Company. Their technicians/enginners will try to replace the most of the part without analysis issue. They motivation to make big bill not solving actual issue. Im looking support for one over charged bill from March 3rd still no one gave any solutions. As of now almost 10 person called from Urban noone gave resolution. Its completely waste of money to get service from this . Not even worth for 1 star
nice service
superb...!!
Toooooooooooooooo Good. at first these companies give such a nice services and rates then slowly they increase the prices and demand. anyways hope for the best.
First time use for AC deep clean and also ended up having to clean drain for extra 599rs. The problems were solved with good attention. The app itself is well built to cover all factors related to repair and service experience. Some may feel that the charges are slightly on the higher side, but it may be worth it if you get a good service agent
Good Service
Good AC service
good
Worst service, always try to book slot it show that all our agent is busy. Worst worst worst service
Best services.
Time waste and mony waste Urban company.. Thare is professionals... Two times come my home bathroom cleaning... But not cleand. In advtajes show meshine cleaning... Thare Is no meshine cleaning
Stupid service
Why there is no haircut professional available in sare homes sec 92 Gurgaon? I have been trying to book since last month? What's the point of including the option then????
No proper help center and response . And professionals doesn't respond to call or chats . No help from the customer care. Even 0 rating is more Totally disappointed
Highly unprofessional.i kept on waiting for professional and then customer support but it was damn useless.why the hell are u running this app?
Good üòä
Worst worst worst 1000000000 times. I thought Urban Company is a brand but it's worst compared to my local shops. Yesterday first time I was booked a ac service by app and it's horrible mistake of my. The company send a technician. The man they send to me was very unprofessional & very rude. And when I raised a complaint till now my complaint neither solve and not even nobody react. In the end i suggest only boycott this app neither u will pay more to app.
Highly unprofessional I will not give any star seems UC doing fraud with customer and taking advance payment but technician are only seeing product and without touching . also UC employee demands 9000 Rs for doing maintenance of AC and same thing I have done in 2500 Rs. I also want UC to refund my amount which I pay for annual charges. Hight third class company to deal with.
very nice, could enjoy salons luxury at home..
Quick and easy one stop solutions
I availed plumbing service from urban clap and I was satisfied. firstly I booked the no-broker plumbing, and i waited for two days but no one turned up. I regret for not opting urban clap in first place. thankyou urban clap for quick response and good service.
Very efficient service, quick booking, very polite and trained and polite technician
Bed experience with urban bewkuf bana kar paise loot rahi hai
good
professional and polite ,fully satisfied
very good üëå
My experience was super good. I booked AC service for window & split and it was performed extremely well by their technician. I would definitely recommend to once try the services offered by urban company.
Worthlessness work ,
Good

There are no negative stars so I can it to them. Pathetic service. Making fool. All the parts of my water purifier are working fine but a loose wire. I called for service. Partner came for visit and said that it's smps and motor both are dead. And advised me to spend 6k for all service. But later on when my friend checked it only a wire is loosed and that's why the motor is not working. They insisted at very moment to change every part and asked the amount at first. Don't send me a regret msg.
good work
A Cheat by Urban Company. Booked a technician for repairing of refrigerator. Technician came and shown estimate for spares which was agreed by me. He asked for advance payment of full amount which i denied. He left keeping the fridge dismantled. Raise the issue with UC, they were unable to provide a new or the old technician. Only rescheduling and cancellation they are doing. My fridge is totally unworkable now. ITS A CHEAT BY UC.
Good experience
good service
Will recommend using Urban Company services
Id give negative rating if i could. Pathetic. I had already paid 400 in advance, the technician again charged 350 after he came. Hidden charges the app never mentions. Cuatomer service sucks, there is only call option, and they can call you but the customer cant. The app shows the time by when they will call back, is always late. Finally they do call then say that they need to speak to the professional and that they will call back. When that will happen, god only knows
Worst service
Its been a horrible experience booked a carpenter he took advance money 18k did not install its been a month, kindly dont book from here even Urban clab officials are not helping out , the worst experience do not try booking from this app as of now my money as well as service both are not done nor will they help out
cost is high
Excellent easy to use
Referring not working I'm referring one of my friend but no received socthcard cheeting people"no customer care service number how to contact urban company I don't know
If I am referring someone to this app . My uc cash points should not be expired in 1 month .. Should get atleast 1 year
Your AC mechanic broke my AC's cabinet front door's open and close system of oneside and left by just locking the other side. After 3 weeks I saw some space between the front door and the cabinet. Thank you for the phenomenal service.
Technicians are not doing good work, instead they proposed to work unofficial way to take lumpsum amount which will be less than urban quote and once we paid for work they ignore our calls in future if we have some issue.
Good services at reasonable prices.
Provides nice service for AC , meet as per my aspectation
very good
Worst customer support
Just not answering anything
Horrible service and even more horrible service recovery. One team doesn't know what the other team is doing and both expect customer to keep repeating the issue. They don't have the slightest clue on what solution to provide and how. Their processes suck. The CEO doesn't care. Regret taking the membership. Will never use it again.
0 customer support. Booked a home service and no one was assigned to the booking for hours. Nobody from the customer support team ever reached out about any complaint I had. Don't see any point in being a user of this app. Uninstalled for the good. :)
Booked paint job. No one turned up.
Worst service
ok
Excellent
I got my RO water purifier promptly and excellently serviced by UC
Don't use offers on this app esp Mobikwik. Beware of using that app as it will enable some zip account which u ll later know that it's loan account and they ll apply 100 rupees activation charges and late fees og minimum 200. Urban company service is fair.
fast nd perfect work done...thank u urban company.üëç
√ë√±icw
excellent service app
Excellent in work
Cheated me of 3000. Never got call from customer care. Refund my money. Else will file police and consumer complaint
super
Not so professional. The person came for installation not experienced and because of that I faces lot of problems
They don't have a customer care number. So you can't call them for any complaints. No complaint = No worries.
Worst service will never take any service from them. Booked 2 window AC service the guy first off all didn't came on time and didn't even informed. Then hi came the next day did 1 service and cancelled the other one without even asking me. I was given only partial refund for the service he cancelled. And the thing is not over he didn't even cleaned the area after doing the servicing. Every inch my room was covered in pool of water and dust. Highly unprofessional services. Worst experience.
Worst service, i had book an AC service for my 2AC's for 9:30 AM, first they said that professional will be assigned one hour before time. They didn't got professional available at that time so it got assigned at 9:27 AM, 3 minutes before. We waited for the person till 12 AM, and at 12AM they said that booking is cancelled by us. WORST SERVICE APP EVER MADE. I am glad i didn't paid to these scammers and had opted for pay after service, you people also don't pay in advance if you love your money.
nice
Do not use this app Service not good at all Specially in peak season they don't have PROFFESSUONALS at all VERY VERY VERY POOR SERVICE
very professional service.
Good Experience Divya was good and polite thanks fo r the service..‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Awesome
Very poor customer service & resolution will take time..it was worst experience after raising complain ..there are several calls for 7 days with different executive & no resolution.
[Edit:- They called and resolved my issue and refunded my difference amount.] Giving 5star. Absolute FRAUD! First the app will show costly services, and after you purchase one of those, the next time you open the UC app it will start to show service which are prices less than your service rate plus some extra lite service. For eg. I chose deep cleaning ac split service for -700/- after i purchased and got the job done. It start to show the same service- 600/- plus one lite cleaning only at 400/-
Worst experience, booked mambership along with service but really disappointed by personnel with cancellation of Booking and not assigned any Engineer.
thief company with thief employees, i have asked them for my ac service, they charged me 3000+ for gas filling and everything, after 3 days ac stopped working and i kept on calling the service guy, urban company... nobody helped me and in the end of the day the voltas came and helped me, so i ll suggest it's better to use the original company for servicing rather than these thieves.
Worse experience Professional ordering me Worst experience Bad bad experiences Should not use urban clap again.
costly
Very bad ac service
Very good service...
work not done in one time and no penlty imppsed on first Technician who was failed done my AC Service
3rd class service totally waste of time and money no customer support And once you have gone to them, you will not get back if you cancel the booking.
very good service
Even 1 star is also waste for this ,I request all the people to not to waste your money regarding AC service from Urban Company, the professionals are not properly trained and also the support team also will not resolve the issues after reapir warranty claim, it is very hard to talk to support team, don't waste you money , i spent around 5000 for my AC repair ,but still it is not working, contacted support team ,even after 10 days still they are unable to resolve the issue,
Third class, professionals never be on time.... Wastage of money
Worst service and vendor and staff untrained
Hidden charges ( minimum order fee and convenient charges) almost double for smal works. If you want to ask plumber to get pipe connection that cost 119 but cost of minimum order fee 60 and convenience fee 39 so 99 additional charges on every service.sonit would be 218. Why don't upfront display this amount why to reflect you cheap.
Worst experience twice I called for service 2 different person came n 2 different problems they detect for same fridge n then when i expect call for this from company they r not responding nor picking up my call since 48hrs
Booked RO system more than a week ago. No one has come to install it. They have no customer support contact number. Messages promise 15 minutes call back. It's been multiple messages and no call back. Paid 8k and can't even contact them. Behaving like fly by night operators.
Booked a massage therapy the previous day , along with buying their membership by making advance payment . Next day no service is provides, I called them to refund my money in entirety , need to have no relation with urban company , they said we will refund only massage therapy money not membership fee . Seem like running ponzi scheme , just take membership fee and deny services.
I think it was a needy idea for people shifting in New area. Services are very good.
Fraud app After plus membership they increase rate list, even they have clear policy that at the time of booking rate list available that will be charged,,,, but on my practical experience after booking they increase rate you are already pay online so you can't cancel that and due to this you have to pay extra l, that's policy of this company to earn more from genuine and needy customer,,,,god bless you
There is no customer care service no we cannot contact them or complain them about there service even if you complain or give 1 star no body contacting you so make sure before order for cleani ng services
I have booked and paid online they accepted the booking the maid called me told me she will be late i agreed am too busy to answer phones ... so they called back to know my location i couldnt oick as am working in a plain ...they didnt come to clean hence i have used it many times and they know my location and in the application shes still assigned i want either someone to clean up or return my money ur mistake u accept booking without knowing location of ur cliet
Do not book urban company massage or salon services.I took a full body massage and got fever and extreme body pain. had to take leave on next day. Reported issue with Urban company - no one called or took any action. avoid this application for your own safety
Extremely irresponsible and unprofessional service. Have been trying to reach out to the team since a week now but haven't heard back from anyone. Had availed the services of painters. The team did what seemed to be a good job in the beginning but soon after the paint started coming off. On calling the customer care our grievance was not addressed in a professional manner.
Edit 1... written 3 emails @resolve...still no response... who's handling customer support!?
Very bad experience with urban company repaint job not done already paid again asking for 6 k for the work I don't want very unhappy don't use this app.
No service after booking and fund also not refund
Service is so good
Customer service not responding and service person also cheating totally waste of money service person damaged my Hitachi AC compressor so please don't use this Urban clap if you need anything find shops near your place
Experienced professional services,price they charge is low as compared to the quality of work the team gives.Highly recommended üëå üëçüèª
This would not even be the last app recommended by me Really very very unprofessional people The painter was drunk when on work and was sleeping on my sofa in the living room Professionalism 0/10 Quality 0/10 Hygiene 0/10 Resolving complaints 0/10 Fake promises 10/10 Cheat 10/10 I would not even rate with one star to this urban company
I have booked AC service and the service was terrible, there was too much dust inside even after service and the service agent said that I need get gas charging and pay extra RS 3000. I denied but since AC stopped cooling I had to call repair people who told me there are fresh signs of forced gas leakage which means service people have done it to make extra money. When I complained about, the person started arguing and later a revisit was planned for me by Urbanclap but the person never appeared
They manage to not respond to the issues under warranty. Absolutely fake promises
Filling OTP is a big head ache. The number changes while you are typing.
good
Worst App. Fully time waste .. please do not use this app
Staff did not do the job completely. They have not cleaned at many areas. Rough scrubber was used on laminated decolam, scratches visible on that. When placed complaint, the Company promised to send again to finish job neatly but failed. They have returned Rs.2000.00 but what about scratches on decolam?
Not able to download the app, worst experience trying from 1 week
Dont use this app. Very serious issues with the co workers associate with this app.
Very good üòäü§†ü§†
I had a bad experience with urban company i booked a beautician from der and den she stole money from my house I tried contacting urban company der was no response from der side fraud company with fraud employees it's time to say good bye to the company
Excelent urban company family Thank u urban partner as a treated like gopd instructions
Very worst service, waiting for my slot from last 5 days for ac installation, and they not assigned any technician tll over the slot time, neither they are providing any communication, what a third class company...please ignore this type of apps.
The rating is not for the App. This is for the actual work that the technicians do by asking customers to cancel the service for their own profit. This has increased in recent times and the Urban Company does not do anything in this regard. With no paperwork, it is difficult to guarantee the work done by a technician. And stop responding with message templates. The ratings are not earned from work. These are asked to the customers to give in return by standing at their door.
good
must use. the technicians left no stone unturned and completed all the jobs required
Horrible service... standard response is that no personal available, reschedule or cancel your booking
very good. cleaned perfectly
Not God ap
Worst experience, if you are taking money today, providing service after 7 million years, then i don't think i need it. Booking fails many times for no reason. This app was good before, now it is just something else entirely.
excellent service each time ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
good work
Very bad experience for AC service. I have booked two AC services and paid Rs.1147/- rupees in advance on 2nd April 2021. One technician visited our residence and complete the first AC service and told us that they will complete the second AC service after six month of first service but my second service is still pending.Urban company not taking any warranty or liability responsibility. Their customer care avoids any answers. It seems fraud to me.
Unexperienced people are being hired.because those people I have loss of Rs.70,000.Ac gas installation was done more than it is needed and so compressor was spoiled.
Service was really awesome...I like it...thank to urban company.
Tried to have video consultation for servicing of AC but not a single professional was available for the whole day
E0f
Booking ke bad bhi nhi ate h paise refund me bhi time lete h koi phone bhi nhi ata h mere time 2 times lapse kr diya bhai log inki service Ram bharose h
Absolutely disappointed. The service providers are never on time. They don't value the customers time.
not sure why you are adding 2 ceiling fans too which are unnecessary as well as whoever comes for cleaning, they ask for ladder to clean ceiling fan. Many of us doesn't have it and they left by uncleaning it as usual. Not sure, why you are clubbing these two. 01/04/2022 - Concern raised as the technician did not arrived. And no call from customer care at all. Seems like customer care also became pathetic. Reducing my rating here. [Update] - Both of my concerns addressed. Hence, raising stars.
Didn't assig professional on time ...already paid the full charge and now not taking the customer care calls also I tried to use their service again ...same issue didn't provide professional now not processing refund also There is no way you can contact customer care
Very poor service
definitely
good job
Very happy with the service
great
Very good app for home services
very nice
Very bad experience with it. Charging high price as compared to regular one. Go find some local mechanic.
Waste of time and money. They do incomplete work and not respond to call.
whay additional Rs 150/- was charged after the servicing. No such information was given before the servicing.
Don't waste you time and money
The service is good but they will do financial fraud When u pay online, they will say they have not got it and will take cash I have been looted of Rs 2500 and the customer care is also of no help They will keep assigning different person and you will keep explaining the same thing. We will we the victim and we have to explain the same thing to so many person It will become so tourcherous that you have to leave your rupees.
Wrost experience
They were not even able to give service at their scheduled time.
Worst application, useless services
Even they were not able to give service
good
Damage my property Rude professional Try to contact urban customer care but unable to find Of someone can guide please help Company has taken charges also
great work
Awesome
Don't go for urban company salon services at all. I had booked for a professional paid surge charge for her and then urban company changed the professional without even informing. I had my palm burnt in the process and now I am trying to call these guys for 2 days and they are not even picking up the call. And have not even refunded the money for the services i didn't avail.
Everything becomes so easy with the help of pros.
They damaged my Ac ... and leaked the gas from other ac so that they can get amount to repair other ac also .. Most unprofessional and cheating services
Great
Waste services Urban AC repair. Opened the AC, proper not fitting waste of services
Can't even change assigned hair dresser which I don't want Always says "something went wrong" when I reschedule and same person is assigned every time and can't even reschedule what *WORST APP*
Good .
Worst service after service my ac stopped working completely. I have booked revisit request everytime it's showing professional not assigned.üò™üò™üò™üò™üò™
They don't know anything....
Very good
Don't send unnecessary and useless notifications otherwise I will have to delete your App
Excellent,technician reported on time and serviced professionals. Highly satisfied..
Pathetic: booked a cleaning service and they rescheduled it 3 times with a excuse that professionals not available. Than canceled the booking with same reason. Wasted my 2 days. Booked deep clean AC service: they advertise foam deep cleaning but when the service guy visited he do not had any foam. Its normal servicing which you can get in much cheaper price in your local area. TV repair: booked the repair and the technician visited looked fraud, he was not able to fix and canceled booking.
Charging convience fee and looting customer. Bearing one or two rest of the services are too costly. Rating customer.. tell me that was a joke.
good
very good service and good behaviour neet and clean
Very much satisfied by their services
Good
superb
good service üëç

service & behaviour was very good
Worst app booked service but unable to pay..showing this card payment is not applicable on this booking 2nos ac service required..
Excellent service
Simply buying my time and keep on rescheduling slot, pathetic services... Sent email as-well
worst service
Very happy
still this services are not available in mp cities
Its very timely,with sincere and honest efforts and minimum fuss
The professional didn't come at the scheduled time neither informed us that he will be late he won't lift the call when we call him. The response of support team is also late, the won't assign another person to do the job , a very bad experience.
bestest service...hassle-free appointments...professional workers...
I had a terrible experience where my new ac was damaged by naseem khan an urban company professional. Even after complaining so many times urban company never replied and neither they called me. Naseem khan even offered me cheap gas filling without booking from urban company. This kind of person's are denting urban companies image and urban company is not taking this issues seriously. I would not recommend any one to book ac service at all from urban company.
timely service
Nice company
excellent work
Horrible sevice standards....don't keep up with their words...urban liars
Perfect
I have booked for bathroom cleaning, but the guys who came for the job was not able do the job because of their inefficiency they were not professional time wasted,
Excellent services
Highly unprofessional behaviour from company i had an issue with booking this representative name "vanshika" talked so rudely like i was an employee of her or so and cut the call in between of me speaking i think this is not really professional as company says and brag abour professionalism. Really disgusted!
Bogus services in most cases. Always same excuse by the assigned service professionals. Only a few are good. Lost faith on Urban Company.
Provide service in (telangana) KHAMMAM district too... Pin 507163...
pathetic experience. booked ac service through the app. my ac was cooling fine before the service, but the guy told me there is no gas.i said that it was cooling fine and refused. when i checked it after the service it was not cooling at all. the guy now continuously calls and says that i should get the gas refilled even when i have refused.
We are happy with easy of booking , payment option, price clearity. Technician came on time and did his job satisfactorily. Thanks !!
In my experience they totally waste. In my washing machine door lock problem.they are removed the spares 2 months back.till now they solved the issues,spares not returned.but in their appthey are post problem solved order complted.
Technicians were very friendly and they did their job perfectly without any hustle. Thanks UC
over-all professional and good staff.
The instructions by Urban company to charge the customer for more expensive services should stop. My routine deep cleaning of the AC turned out to be a nightmarish experience when the UC employee charged me for faulty component(4k Rs charge for PCB) although my request was only for cleaning. UC should focus on giving good equipments & spares to their employees. The AC cleaning foam bottle was empty and he did not have a spare. Final cleaning was with water only, no foam.
App is good. but full premium home cleaning service is not good as urbanclap promises or showcase in advertising.
good work
App showing no slots at all. A kind of eye wash. They should display " we don't service in Agra. Wasted money on UC membership
Last cooler service booking was worst experience after so many years
Never use the srrvice utiltimately these people buy time.. take money then it will be refunded in 7 working days.. Wrost comp. Booked my ac appoitment for 31st mar at 5pm... Now when i open this app it ask is it confirmed...are u people out of mind when i made the payment why shld i need to confirm.. I clicked on confirm nw techinian says cant come wil come tomo by 8am.again he called can i come today after 8pm i said it would be tough to setvice ac in dark come tomor... Now he says i wil come
Dont use urban clap for AC tasks. They send fraud technician who forces to cancel UC service and take their personal service n later dont pick the phone if any issue comes. Complaint done to UC, but never received call from UC escalation team, they close the ticket without redolution. Simply avoid UC for atleast AC work. You will regret.
When will this app will provide service in bhikhanpur the worst never provide service in my area
Good
The way they clean your Air conditioner is like superb
best service provider
After service (ex-water purifier service) if there is any issue related to it, they start making excuses. Poor experience, better to go with local vendors
Worst service
Very disappointing experience I felt today . Please never book a AC gas filling service with them if you don't want to make a bill to double from 2500 to 5000
I work in this company, And my category manager change my hub without any information. So disappointed. Didn't expect from this company
Md.Tajuddin really did a excellent job on me.
BEST SERVICE AVAILABLE AND ALL ARE PROFESSIONALS BECAUSE I BOOKED FOR MY FRIDGE REPAIRING AND ALSO FOR MY DUAL INVERTER SPLIT AC SERVICE AND ONE NON INVERTER AC SERVICE ALSO NOTE ( THEY ARE DOING BEST JOB PERFECT 10 OUT OF 10 MARKS FOR THEIR WORK FANTASTIC TREMENDOUS MARVELOUS I AM ROSHAN FROM NITI VIHAR
I've been using this app from the last 4 years. I've never been disappointed with any of the services being provided by the urban company team. There were somethings which initially needed some modifications but with time everything changed. So, yes, today if I look for anything to be done on time and appropriately, I book the respective service and find it quite helpful and happy about the same. Thank you Urban Company Team for delivering services on time and assigning the best of professionals
The service has decreased by time
trusted brand
Bad customer service, pathetic call center. The standard lf service is quite bad
very nice professional so sabse baat time Se pahle need Thi muje 20minutes pahle aa gye üëå
Worst service they will damage your property and equipment.
No professionals has assigned for AC repair, I have booked twice and rescheduled but there is no proper response and intimation. The worst experience after installing this app. Don't trust this app blindly.
professional is very polite to provide the services.
Do not service with Urbanclap's app because it is an unless app and takes more money from the company or you have their ac repairers don't download any urbanclap app worst. appcustomer care executive very poor
Good
worst app.worst response.never book through urban company.
very nice
good
Pathetic service. Person not assigned as per schedule time
Very polite
amazing work , such good services , best of luck
The technician was very polite and explained to us the likely problem nicely.
really awesome cleaning..Good service
Professional
Worstttttt team work.... Their teams are busy at the mentioned address... No members are free to give service for weeks.. Now slots are not available as per customers convenience... Worst experience.. I delayed my AC service for nothing
It's been 2 days since I booked for service cleaning and no professional is been assigned n even after rescheduling also no one assigned. It's totally a time waste of customers. If no service available then simply say it . So that customers will not rely on ur service. Sure will complaint about ur service.
I should have given zero star... After ac servicing my ac got damaged .. revisit mai bhi kuch solve nhi kiya ... Call back mai they told will give UC credit or will send senior professional but nothing has been done.... Please do not use this app for any services better to call your local man they say something and do nothing
Foam were not spreads uniformly by the spraying it was done by a brush, which is not recommended, it seems that they have been saved by the other means. And in the gas charging field they are very peculiar method have done. At least they should allow to carry a light weight machine to show the measurement of gas before filling for the customer satisfaction and content. And on the gas cylinder there is nothing labeled which quality of gas they charged in to inverter machine. There's no attach opt
Nice service
Very horrible experience, we have took a painting job and seepage work for 30K from them and after 2 months, seepage was all over the place. Their painter Irfan Khan did not pick up our calls and whenever we lodge complaint the app messages us that they will call back in 15 mins but no one calls. After sometime we can see that they put our complaint in resolved category. Very unprofessional and obnoxious customer service, they looted us for 30K
Very bad experience
Worst service provider. Super expensive. Nothing mention in invoice..
Headache off one's shoulders.
Maine appliance protection plan purchase Kiya hai,lekin mai claim registered nahi kar pa raha hoon,please meri problem ko solve kar dein.
nice without any kitch khich job done
Worst Services By Urban Club, They damge our products and and not responding... Collection amounts from us and looting our money, technicians asking us to give 5 star rating.. my AC got complete damage after using their AC Water Jet cleaning... Since one week am fallowing up with them not even caring about my complaint... Urban company is Looting company and customers applicans damaging company...
Very nice
Best app for any house hold related service
All is well until something goes wrong. The attitude of engineers on property damage, the unhelpful approach of people receiving our calls on escalating matters, the process of refund.. too tiring! Can be easily avoided by the local handyman instead of Urban Company. Giving up on this!
I never had seen Such a Worst Service. No Professional is answering Calls. Customer Support response is too Worst. Without any Professional they are doing all Bookings and again asking Customers to Postpone it for tomorrow and Day after tomorrow
They destroyed my window AC motor during service. They didn't covered the motor due to which water get inside it and its get damaged.
Not happy with the services. Sometimes people cancel, sometimes people refuse to do the work. It's better to get local people to do the job. They are more motivated, accomodating and resourceful.
Purely waste service by these people. For new job they will allot a person immediately but if a work has not been done properly by them, then just pray to god. Horrible service. They just will experiment with ur appliances and throw a bill to u.
Useless app with many false promises. They have a standard parts rate card on the app for AC. But after visiting the premises, the techincian says we cannot provide parts at this rate. And we can't provide you 60 days service warranty which the company promises during its promotions. Won't recommend to anyone.
I was not able find anyway to connect to customer care, had to cancel the service rather than make adjustments
I am very dissatisfied with this people come late by 1hr and services are very poor and the customer support is also not supportive they don't resolve issue and mark as problem resolved
good
The technician ruined our split airconditioner & desired my repeated requests no customer care support being assisted
The customer care doesn't care to callback. I endup wasting 2 days waiting for the professional after paying 4k. Really disappointing
The application is not working properly at all. Whenever I click on a particular service, I.e. AC or Men's massage, the app simply redirects to the homepage. Please fix the app asap
Good service
done perfectly
excellent work
Highly unprofessional and unethical people in the system. It's a scam and fraud what they are doing. They take advance payment for booking and at the last moment deny the services and take 4 to 7 days for refund. It's a scam of using people money without any interest
AC servicing was a good experience and job done very well
Great service..
It's really worst experience with U.C. for A.C SERVICE..
. Ii √ß pp zz d you. IPL üòô BH no in no BH ll lo na BB on vv VV cc; r bhuva no BB.. Tj
Really bad experience, they didn't assign service engineer, don't followup, no response to chat as well. Useless team, I suggest to go with house joy instead. Much better response. This company is unable to provide services but happy to advertise annual membership . That annual membership is a joke and waste of money as they can't provide any services reliably.
Worst services. No response and they will not lift the calls and for repairs under warranty they are not responding atall.
it's really awesome service....
Your price are only for higher level guys. Not for lower or middle class peoples.
Worst service don't book any body please they very useless plz my personal request don't waste ur money our maid r better than them
Very poor services never book from urban clap
superb
perfect
Excellent
Ac service professional broke the indoor unit. No response from UC after 20 hrs also. Living without AC Since yesterday. UC app says,there would be resolution call within 15 minüò¨üò¨. It's better to go back to your friendly neighborhood mechanic.
Prime bookings are never available
excellent service
Very disappointed by painter
excellent
It's perfect and very easy to use
Don't recommend this app to others. They are not professionals. Automatic cancelation of service will be done. You can't able to reach any person if any issues, only they can call you. Refund also takes long time. They are not worth for single star also.
very good
1st experience is the last experience i believe and my 1st experience with UC is very bad.. there customer service people ask us the preferable time and still we dont get our service done by that time and after that the ticket which i raised is automatically resolved without informing us.. a very bad service and i will let people know that never ever use URBAN COMPANY SERVICE'S.
very expensive services for ac gas charging
Thanks UC for resolving my complaint
service is not up to the mark
Please don't act on official portals like you care and ask for feedback.. you know exactly your miserable time management & planning
Recent professional was very good. Still have not heard from the customer support. But I change my rating solely for Benazir Nisha
excellent and prmpt service
Always experiencing same thing..no slot services at attapur for spa
Bairiya SAMPATCHAK area in patna new isbt bus stand but urban staff no come this very bad response about and services
The app is pathetic. Very unfriendly. 1. Cannot see the cart if i close the app before placing the order. I have to start allover again to entire search the service and add to cart. 2. Cannot see customer care help button anywhere in the app unless you place an order.
very polite and professional attitude.
they do excellent job
Pathetic Service. Waste of Time & Money
First, the booking is unilaterally rescheduled, which took us contacting them to fix. Second, service provider arrives with little to no supplies. When inquired, behaves rudely and walks off_no work done. Third, booking is cancelled with a misleading reason by the company, absolving them of any responsibility. Fourth, the company connects me to different customer care professionals, having the same conversation over and over. They have no control over their extended staff and no inclination.
Poor Service
good service
Their services are great
it depends on how they work, skill varies with each and every one. so you must have to be lucky to get the right one.
Application not working.
wonder ful experience
Customer service is pathetic they never call back or inform u about a service cancellation
I availed AC service from UC. Their technician was a con. he damaged my AC intentionally so that he can charge me for refilling the gas. So a AC which was working fine prior to UC service stopped working within 2 days of service because UC technician has leaked the gas. Beware of these theives..whatever is shown in the Advertisement about cleaning and professional service is a big lie..my advice never take any AC service from UC. Call manufacturer engineer or a trusted local mechanic..
very good
No one can be more fraudulent then this company.
Pest control service is charged too high. No doubt pest control is done professionally. They promise 90 days of warranty but after getting the payment they CANCEL the warranty period without informing the consumer. Consumer is left with no option than to purchase again a service of pest control. Worst feeling after being duped. 5 star for a person who did the job but 0 star for their policy of cancelling the warranty period without informing me.
Bhakwas, they visit your ac at reasonable price-seems to be- suggests every customer to top up ac gas-@2500 rs, chota Kam unclog @ Rs.700, no need to top up gas for 10-12 years unless leakage Don't get cheated.
I have Urban clap membership. I did booking for AC service and repair. I did booking 3 times but the engineers were no able to understand the issue and just left by cancelling the booking. Don't you have support system for engineer in case they are struggling to understand the issue. What is the point of membership when I am struggling for 15 days.
Still the same, cheats and frauds. Lying is an acquired skill I think
My experience with urban company was not very great I had requested for a home hair salon service before a wedding and nobody arrived despite of being allotted a specific slot for me in the morning.When I called the customer service they said that the person forgot about the service and we will not be able to make it in time. Do not relay on their service if you are in a hurry or have an important event right after. No idea if we have improved their services lately but try and let me know.
You can beat SCAM 1992, in terms of fraud.
Refund process very poor üòî.
Last AC service in which gas filled but now AC not producing cooling what was the worst experience.
Good
The service provided by classic option is extremely bad...and pathetic...please improve services by beauticians...
Very bad experience, no punctuality, no proper tools, don't clean properly. AC is not cooling after service and installation. Previously it was working fine. I recommend don't order any technical services from this app. These people are unprofessional and invested money for good ad and looting customers who are giving opportunity to them.
Nice sevice
Start incorporating services which help us in selling items at scrap value or second hand price..
üëç
Atul bhai great technician very good service
good service
There service is pathetic. There people dont respond the call. They reject the service I hav paid for as per there convenience without any prior information.
Pothetic experience,first a fal she came late at 3pm,on other side she forgot pedicure cream for which she went down n came ,she was super slow,the slowest beautician i have ever seen,for just 2 hours work she took 4 hours,she completed everything by 7pm she forgot nail paint remover too... I have paid a good amount of money but my first experience with Urban clap was damn pothetic.. kindly give proper training to the people you hire,else send proper professionals.
Wonderful
Very unprofessional service provider... The so called UC professional was not at aware of the booking... when the person did not arrive at the assigned time then i made a call to the professional and to my surprise he said that the Customer care is taking the booking on its own and he is not aware of the booking... when this was reported through app i was given an option to have a call back but i did not get a call.. very unprofessional / unethical and disgusting experience...
I tried for scheduling a revisit just after a day however could not do so as it shows some error which I believe is not a valid response ..
Fully satisfied with the service
excellent
Excellent job
one should surely go with him. he has cleaned the bathroom very well was happy with his service thanks
Excellent app with good staff
It's totally waste of money ... professional are expecting money for each step of their move ..better to go with local machanics .zero rating. Charged 1000 rupees for door bell installation
Charging minimum order fees and convenience fee at the same time is outrightly looting the customers.Shame
Nice app for various kind of day to day work
Booked ac installation for the first time and thr professional rescheduled it from afternoon to evening and then informed he'll arrive in the night, I asked him to let it be. I've raised a complaint and there is no call back yet. Not a great first experience.
Never book chimney service. Their partners are unprofessional and highly unskilled. Damaged my chimney.
I would have give zero rating if possible.. pathetic experience and pathetic service..the service provider ruined our velvet sofa as he washed it with liquid detergent instead of dry shampoo.. I raised multiple issues but no solution provided. I have done the payment to the service provider and they are saying that we have cancelled the booking..we have all the proof which signifies that he came and took the amount..If not resolved we will raise complaint in forum
Ghatiya company hai..service ke rate app mei kuch hai aur service executive ki app mei kuch. Aur booking slots mei nahi aa rahe
very good
Pricing is too high.
One of the useless service provider. Booked a plumber for 27 th march 1. They have helpline for the professional and they cancelled the service as the plumber reached. The added a cancellation charge for rebooking. They have given a cashback after a good amount of follow up. Wasted my time. 2. Again booked plumber for 30 March for 2pm. The guy arrived early and said no tools. Urban company doesn't work to resolve problems for the customer.3. They booked again and plumber asked huge amount.
very humble and soft spoken therapist..
Bad service
Please revisit your charges. you can certainly make it more affordable.
Waste. My rating is 0. This app is complete waste. I tried to connect them to repair Air cooler but always showing 'all our professionals for this locations are busy. We can notify you when available'. Everyday since 10 days same message. Hopeless and uninstalled this. Friends, don't waste time to use this. In Bangalore City facing this issue means, just understand other city. My friends also faced same issues so we all decided to avoid this waste app.
Nice experience Love it ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
This is a very bad company the technician will not even get assigned. Local people are better than them
Good work
very good services
User interface was good as well as it's services
Worst Experience with urban company
Pathetic experience i had recently. Beautician name is Latika Sharma. She is continuously reaching me on whatsapp to book her personally. I told her i didn't liked her service so stop messaging me but she is messaging me every month and forcing me to book her.
very good
everyone should try
Good service
No customer care number for support
please consider my point frst uc is telling some amount after that ur giving extra amount
satisfied app
Good
Very unprofessional ..not well trained
Professional didn't come as per the appointment also didnt even bother to inform.
Worst service don't believe, they are not correct people, they are service start with Rs 599/- but end with gas 2800+1200 for nitrogen test etc.., I am fully disappointed with these people.. worst worst service.
Very good
My AC was damaged by UC person. I kept complaining but urban company kept ignoring. Now with summer on threshold i am left with a damaged ac.worst service, no customer orientation. Writing again- the problem has not been solved yet, looks like the AC is permanently damaged, I want the refund.
marvles
Great service. Seetha did an excellent job.
S time saving and energy saving. Luv it
good speed , light cleaning should have been done to customers satisfied .
Excellent service
Worst experience with Urban Comany They don't arrive on time. Executives keep on updating that the customer phone is not reachable and thus delay the appointments
Great experience in AC service
My latest experiance is like cheating by Urban Company. Got AC shifted, mechanic discharged ac gas completely and then asking payment for charging the gas. This has to stop.
nice service
Poor & pathetic costumer care services
This is app very helpful...for all types of home need services.
It's been 5 days and a pregnant lady is suffering cause of a professional sent by them who ruined our AC. We claimed UC warranty and again a professional came and checked everything, approved the problem. And it's been 4 days since we're waiting for a call from UC. Tried every mode of communication available. I'm so lost and out of options at this moment.
Nice work No need to search for services now, just download the app and book the service you want!
Seriously users don't use urban company they are ridiculous. If anything is damaged while service you guys will not get any resolution. They will keep on faking commitments and your warrenty that they give will get over. My property is damaged while AC repair and these guys even are not supporting...
Repeatedly getting worst experiences from UC, i wonder how they got 4.5 rating,.. For ac service, i requested for online payment option after service,..because of getting cashback,And i have added money to amazon pay, but professional changed payment through cash without asking me,..regarding that i have complained to customer care, but no solution for same,.. My amaozon money and cashback wasted, this is third time i am getting worst experience, UC ENJOYING MARKET LEAD BCZ OF monopoly,.day 3
No place.where it says time of service..or confirmed booking.total.waste of time..highly irritating
free of cost it I like it ü•∞ü•∞üíúü•∞üíôü•∞
The worst app ever.. super shady.. you can't find your booking.. you can't reach out for customer service.. don't waste your time with them.
Sending inexperienced person's
I am extremely disappointed with the service provided in terms of booking and professional being assigned. Have never received any call back when requested in the help centre. Had high hopes with the company but have lost faith in its service.
Third class even charges are higher then local
Good
They promise a slot and simply deny service after payment
I m satisfied with the service.good job.
prices are high it should be less
Third class fraud company! Their AC technician damaged my AC and they haven't provided any resolution to that. There is no way to reach out to customer support. You keep requesting for call backs and they never respond. Cheaters of the highest order. Won't ever place orders with them again.
Very worst customer service experience. I have been keep on requesting a call 4-5 times in a row and one time they called they didn't resolve my issue rather ask for sometime and didn't even follow up after that.
excellent job provide by uc
I don't really write any review but I have to write today because this service is very terrible.No discipline shown from both the company and the professional.
Pathetic App. 29-03-22, Booked ac service no technician assigned.. UC clueless UC do not have control over there technician. it is another aggregator. 8 out of 10 booking has problem. Painting job , 1 yr warranty given , patches comes within 3 weeks. But UC not providing warranty claim. You better hire from Justdial kind of website or on ur own network. Avoid UC at all cost!! I hv mailed u already. Talked to ur team 10 times. No resolution.
Too late service..... Machanic reached after 2hours of my booking time.... And the worst thing was the customer service didn't respond any message.... Worst experience
Bad experiance regarding urban clap carpainter assigned.....urban clap carpainter never carries ply cutter and because of that my three booking had been cancelled....carpainter is not carrying cutter which is basic need of his work is unexpected. Still my work is pending because I had dependent on UC Carpainter.
Not good service
Addressing the urban consumers pain point
I had placed AC service request (prepaid). No one turned up. Customer care is not replying back to requests. Money was already deducted.
Worst experience. They booked the slot for window AC installation and service but never showed up. The reason given was unavailability of techician. Why accept the booking in the first place. On complain they they took their own sweet time to revert back the amount and that too incomplete.
I had worst experience with this co. This co. has no proper helpline to solve your issue. I strongly suggest that never ever take any subscription from UC. Because after that they won't be interested to serve you any more.
Chor company, I am a plus member as well as amc holder but company charged me full amount on refrigerator repair on 13 th march and my complaint still pending, no action taken by company.
Urban company service is very good and employees also expert their work. I am very happy about my repair work..
Pls train them properly in communication level and how to talk and behave with customers, they are getting angry easily, their behavior not at all good talking very cheap and no respect.
super
urban company a very useful app to get domestic work and repair done.
Good work
Too costly
great job
gud
well behaved and good work ,nice person
Agencies hired by urban clap JAS SERVICE PROVIDERS are really unprofessional and stinking badly.... very bad experience yesterday.... spent approximately,‚Çπ 9500.00....
I 100% agree with one of the customer the service providers don't turn up. I had booked a carpenter and twice they did not turn up. We are waiting leaving all our office work to get the work done. Total mental agony.
good
Everytime I try booking a repair service the app shows Technicians slots are currently not available.
Very unprofessional
Best company for AC servicing
Very nice work
Full advanced payment taken but Service not provided at the assigned time. Not worth 49 rupees convenience fee.
They provide temporary fix for the appliances and ask for multiple part change to raise the amount for the billing.
not very professional as per company reviews and demostation
Nice service so far...... I received only one service as yet ... Thanks
Professional are not actually professional. they only look for there profit not for customer satisfaction. Forcing customer for extra payment for doing nothing. Very disappointed service. Don't go for it specifically for AC service. Very terrible it was.
Cheated me with wrong instructions no refund yet
Your App is not working over Wifi. My wifi is working properly and all other apps are working but your app does not seems to work. It only works on Mobile Data.
Nice service app, used for my AC service regularly from last 2 year + used salon service - Kudos to UC team for their 5* star service
nice experience
Good peat control Work uc company
Really a wonderful app using since 2020
Nice
Pathetic. They keep you waiting. Do not allocate technician. Keep rescheduling and their technicians do not appear on scheduled day. Finally when you cancel out of frustration, they do not refund you full Booking amount ..
This app and their services, customer support deserves zero star. After my ac service it has started making weird noises and since then i have been trying to contact urban company service, they haven't call me back yet
Don't buy premium membership as they don't deal in time...waste of money... Waiting for a week for technician to visit...but they don't have time to call customer...its was a prepaid order and my money is stuck with them.
Nice app
Excellent service
Looking out for a company where we can get all the basic services in a click .. finally landed in urban company . The process here is very easy from selecting a job to payment . Great app and highly satisfied with the services availed so far
Good services to us to
The worstest experience,I have booked for window cleaning, a call came from urban company butI couldn't answer the call , the representative again called me in the evening and said that he cannot come in the morning, he xan only make it after 3 pm , I said it's ok with me, and come in the evening, later in the evening I received a message stating that i no longer required the service.
Excellent service
Very bad support after service.
Expensive services.
3 days se try kar rahe hai BOOKING hohi nahi rha ... 1st time krva rahe hai ... starting me hi ese issues hai .. App mai contact number bhi nahi diya aapka to help kisse mange
A customer centric, hassle free, transparent and neat dealing. The standardization of each elements of service is the best part that I like most. Cleaning jobs such as bathroom, kitchens, repeat package of celing fan cleaning etc. are not pocket friendly. UC may think about innovative application on cleaning & less time taken. After all cleanliness is Godliness.
I gave my flat for painting, end of the day felt like giving a local painters is much better. Or directly giving it to asian paints. By paying 50k I am not satisfied. After my review. Resolve team sent a formal mail, and they by themselves decided its closed. As far as painting service don't go for it. To Resolve team Don't reply to me by saying will solve your issue, u people r not for customer satisfaction.
Booked for a AC service, payment done, but technician refused to give service, payment received back. Worst experience. Rateing -ve
Good service.
App works fine bt aftersales is pathetic Professional damaged my property and UC has not resolved the issue as yet i have to bear a loss of 15000 for the damage caused by the profeesionak to my property
Company gives no option for model at the time of booking.Also there is no tablet provided for water tank cleaning
Frod company, they charge 1800 for AC cleaning
It's good application for all services
Very high rates....
excellent work
good service
Most unprofessional service ever.... The slot booking facility is of no use when there is a delay in the service being provided. The engineer called me just one minute before the booked slot and informed that he will be 1 hour delayed. Also, I raised a complaint on application and no response was received.
Very polite behavior the professional have and well job urban company you had a great technicians
Nice experience with urban clap.. My life is more easy now reagarding parlor issue
Used UC for the first time and liked the service. Some professionals are very good
Got a free video call and fixed my own thing just by explaining. This is so cool. DYI
Excellent servicing and worth of money paid Far superior to company servicing
Pathetic service...after scheduling for week these people simply cancel the booking citing issue of Non availability of service guys ...what where u doing for whole week sleep over the order
Unprofessional
good service
Pathetic service nobody will accept the service you won't even get a proper reply from the professional most useless app ever made.
There is no cumtomer care number.They talk to you at their convenience . They do not value their customer if customer claim their warranty. Very bad experience.
Excellent service provided by Raj Santan Kumar and his team A definite 5/5
My repair and service done yesterday, as per professional I pay 10098 RS , but still not getting my correct invoice. After several follow up now aap is showing paid money , however while downloading invoice in my Mail still old invoice showing , where reflecting I pay only 798 RS where I actually pay 10098 RS .Struggling since morning, but not getting proper response from urban company, worst service , *logo Ko ye bewkoof samjte hai*
Pathetic Services!!! First the slots were given after 10 days. Still we waited for ten days but unfortunately no one came at the given time. I was rebooked after 2 days. The technician came but we faced some issues with billing. It was a completely prepaid service but still their technicians application was showing a balance of 190. We tried to reach the Customer Care but they all were busy. Had to spent more than two hours to get the issues resolved and finally cancelled the booking.
Great app... Cover all kinds of work related to home... Cost effective also...
Excellent application, one stop solution
The Salon services are good, but please please do not use the app for any repair services.. their Engineers are not qualified and they will damage your electronic goods rather than repairing it. Our A/c has stopped working completely even though it was earlier just a minor issue for which we had booked the service.
It was good üëç
Good service..one can prefer..
overcharged...approx 3 times higher than the price shown at time of booking
Very bad experience to book a.c service, No one visit and automatically booking canceled.
Urban Clap has very professional technicians like Anjar Alam. he was superb and mind blowing
Excellent service, superb
service verry good
Chor kampani
I have booked the service to replace the channel of the drawer of kitchen but after few days of replacing it the same problem persisted due to the fitting issue. After sale service was also Pathetic. I wanted to take a revisit. He insisted for refund I dinied just becase the refund amount was 208 and my total booking amount was 298 He asked me to take the refund and do the fresh booking. It was a loss for me of Rs. 90 I denied I am upset just because of this kind of unprofessional behaviour
Worst service provider day by day getting worst service waste of money and time unprofessional team
Good service
Good
good service excellent service technician work
I have been trying to get in touch with someone from your team, have raised call back request 7 times, still no one has called yet. Very very unprofessional.
excellent
Avoid at all costs. No customer service, or service. They take our booking and make us wait to only inform us at the last moment that person is unavailable and we may cancel or reschedule. Our time is of no value to them. I took leave to remain home for the same. I also have their membership which is supposed to give you priority and better service. Now we know better. When they call you and do not solve your problem, they will not even connect you with a supervisor.
Worst experience ever, the electricians here are very inexperienced and abusive, they use foul language for the work they have messed up, when spoken to backened team you get zero support
I though this app provide good service. Ac service & repair section free instant video call consult is not opening. I don't no what is happening iam gone delete this app.

Kindly provide more services in minimum amount
Fraud company
Good
excellent,i book 10 o clock 10.30 plumber arrived and nice good job ,i amm very satisfied with urban company and plumber
Caught one electrician stealing atmyhome sent by UC. On complaining they said they have disengaged the services of the said person. Today booked AC service and the same person is being sent for the job
Stupid App, if UC consultant charges Convenience charges but still full charge is applied and we rate the Consultant as 1 rating and they block the UC consultant and his work until the customer doesn't change the rating. And for the customer they cannot change rating after 2 days of submission.
Worst service and worse app. I am booking service from 2 days but these people dont have professionals. Also they have not given any number for contact . If someone paid then their money will get stuck with them. These people will give u call on their cmfrtble time. If u urban company dont have sufficient staff and they cant give service to people on time then please kindly mention in block letters we are not able to give service.finally, stead of 10:30 they came by 12:00 noon.so i edited
Stop this junk app.you take booking n don't assign professional and dont even care to inform the recipient on top you delete the comments from playsote app too.. how much more perils will you go down too. Really pathetic.
will review the working ac for few days
app is good but policy is too worse
First impression is best
222w
Good n clean work
superb experience
Worst experience, they have spoiled my ac and now they are not even bothered to repond to me. Pls don't book urban and they don't have ethics and is the worst service ever. They are cheaters as they do wrong service but pretend they are the best
Doesn't even get downloaded
Almost I spent 3500rs last year and 4500rs today for my AC issue ..still AC is not cooling as expected.Very regret to use your services .Last year I booked AC service due to ac is not cooling.At that time your so called experts didn't check leakage and simply filled gas.After 4 months again same issue .Today I booked again and spent 4500rs ..still AC is not cooling. I sent a mail reg how you technician cheated.
Very very poor service. I think URBAN Company is not a professional their Engineer are not punctual.
Extremely unprofessional.. Was bit better before. Now a days all the services are bad. Either the professionals don't contact at all and we don't even know if they will come for the service or the attitude is not good. Even customer support is not keen to address issues on time..
Urban Company is a cheat. Based on their ad that they provide deep clean AC service I booked two deep clean service for my ACs for Rs. 649 each (Rs. 1300 for two). They claimed that they use foam jet for their deep clean service and it was also mentioned in their booking details but when the service people came they said foam jet is an extra add on and we will have to pay Rs. 350 extra for each AC to use foam. They just cleaned my ACs using water and they were done. 1300 for water clean service!
Ek no. Ki bakwas service hai is company ki is se better local hi sahi cheap and best ye log high price lekar bhi thik se kaam nhi karte... Professional ke naam lekar rate lete hai aur inki inke company se trainer type log aate hai jo sikh rahe hote ....
My Chair has been damaged by the so called trained technicians. Every day I ask for a call back. They call and say we are working on your issue. 8 days have passed but no response from Urban company.
excellent
Trying to book service. At first it showed all slots are available and moving ahead it's showed that no slots are available. How can 12 slots be booked within a minute. It's pathetic app.
Highly unprofessional services by so called professionals. Even after confirming the booking, professional didn't show up and didn't answer calls. Don't rely on Urban Company and there lucrative discounts. Extremely dissatisfied
excellent
nice
Extremely bad experience. I will never hire urban clap. Unprofessional people.
I booked intense deep clean mainly because of Machine but the Machine was not used, that is only for advertising purposes itseams very bad... How can I expect deep clean without Machine
Worst Service and Support
Worst app
Daily Life Necessity
worst service, customer support even don't know anything..
Very skilful person they are sending the problem
Worest experience. My first booking was cancelled by the service person without my knowledge. I was waiting for my AC service without attending any of my office and personal work. Don't really on this fake companies, trust your local people.
Services are awesome but charges are also getting increased.
I spend 1.5 k on pest control but now also received bedbugs this is 4 day
Nice service üëç
Good app
Inexperienced ppl are working here. Worst hairdresser I ever met through UC
Excellent service. App very comfortable and scope of work covered widely.
Using customer innocence, doing unwanted things and charging more
Today got out split ac serviced. The technician was the best in his profession.
customer support services was very slow and poor
Very unprofessional behavior. Technicians damaged my Indoor panal of AC . I came to know this on next day . They are not technical person they ware look like kabari wale. Don't use this app . They are running scandal for cheating peoples we should call our near one technician for AC service .No reply from this company side now I have to buy new AC because of this company service.
Had very good experience up until now but the UC lost its professionalism, they outsource local professional which now a days respond as per there wish and customer care response is always same that we will call you in 15 minutes but call will never come. UC plus membership is a sham, you get same professional as everyone one else and customer support is a prank which they play on customers.
perfect work
The executive solved my problem very nicely. Devoted time to solve my problem. I am satisfied with the work
Poor service. After booking service not provided also no communication from the App officials.
Unprofessional service man
I am highly satisfied with the service provided by Urban Company
why is there a monthly fee deducted from my card $3?
Very nice üëåüëåüëçüëç
They are good until you are a revenue generating customer. But when you need their help, they will find execuse and citing policy not to help.
Just so much better than normal local service men very easy to use recommend it
very good app
superb, Amazing and Outstanding. Totally worth the money! Highly recommend! Go for itüëç
Good app, but it could be made more user friendly. Consumer service interface is very cumbersome and slow in response. Like there's no phone number to contact incase of any problem which requires immediate action or reporting. Consumers have to first press help , and press Callback. The response time of call back is 15 minutes to an hour, by this time frustration sets in and the consumer has to cancel the appointment. Request have faster procedure for consumer to convey grievances.
Very bad experience faced. Without intimation the service fellow cancelled the booking. Did not explain the reason for cancellation. Whole day plan got waste because of urban company. Very sorry
Good service , expert technician .
Bad experience....the company just know to cheat and earn
great service
perfect and professional services
No option to connect with cutomer service, when you try to claim warranty there are no alots but for a fresh booking you can book any slot. Have been trying to book for 8 days but have not received a callbank so far.
will recommend
Fake promises made buy company,and bad professional, really wasted time with there service,and at the end they cancel the project.
Awsome
safety money is taken more
Exceptional .I would definitely recommend Urban Company
The service provided by Arockiaraj and team is not upto the mark ,, Especially Arockiaraj is not letting their co-workers (two person came along with him) do the work politely , Always rushing them to do the work . As a customer I am not satisfied as this is first time service for me and I heard too good about the UC service thats y booked . That guy always focused on attending next booking inspite of completing all the work here in full house cleaning premium which would definitely take time .. There is no perfection in his job , whatever we ask he says that is not covered and he tried to escape saying deep cleaning for floor is not covered then I checked everything and was clearly monitoring him to do it .. No professionalism .. Please do not assign them to anyone sorry
No beautician assigned. This happens every time. Please reconsider staying in this business Urban Company, you seem to be losing your grip on common sense. Take a step back and question your decisions
Today was my first service and the service provided was awesome and at an affordable price
Good service.
Poor Sevice, they do not have customer care phone number ...
Worst service charge

Professional denied the service and there is no freaking way to reach the company call center
supriya's service was outstanding.would suggest her to other clients
Wrost experience, it's a layer company.
Money was debited but didn't get the refund
Pathetic experience. AC service job paused in between and service agent not returning with the repaired part. They are rescheduling without any communication or consent from customer. Do not ever pay any money to them. They will just grab it and not do the work.
I booked an appointment for Ac service. Agent was not even assigned and then i canceled. Then I booked bathroom cleaning service where i had to reschedule this time as agent was again not assigned and Today The agent was supposed to come by 4:00 PM and still the Agent has not been assigned yet. Worst experience
Good app
average
Took services for my 20 years old Sharp company microwave which stopped working.Sri Devdas service tech got it rectified and kept in working condition although motherboard could not be rectified perfectly due to it's 2 decades age.Will watch it's performance.
For female services are good enough. For those I would give even 5 stars considering the level of service and corresponding price. But gave only 3 stars because there is no pedicure service for men. This is an emergency service for men, because most men now a days are diabetic and they need diabetic foot care.
The professional assigned refused to provide service and also demanded extra money. When raised an issue through the app, the customer service did not even gave a call although the app shows that they will contact me within a stipulated time frame.
They never ask u about ur ac make and Technology but refuse service saying they are not compatible for them
on the expensive side but handy.
Excellent application
I would recommend not to install the App and waste your valuable time. Let me share you my recent experience. I booked deep clean of my toilet, the professional who came said deep clean is normal clean you should book intense clean. Asked me to pay more when deep clean was enough. I asked him to do what was booked. He refused and went back home. He had 4.7 rating with this behavior. I cannot rate him until he cleans the toilet. So he is cleaning only which he likes and extra money he ask.
As per your add i booked bathroom cleaning charged 550/ the work is not more than 100/ rs cheating business
Good technicians for AC and bathroom cleaning work
Foam & Jet water wash was used by the technician to clean my Samsung 1.5 Ton AC. Temperature Display Board was removed and kept aside before the device began. Technician Naresh did a good job. I would highly recommend his service. Thank you.
Extremely poor customer service. Very difficult to contact them. They say they'll call within 15 min. but never do even for UC Plus members. I would have cancelled my subscription if I could. They reschedule my booking by 1 week with no compensation and even after a week there is no response from them. Feel like a waste of time.
good service thank you!
Nice
Nice work
Good
Good Service
Pathetic Useless and Loot Company. First they will cancel your pay after service delivery few times then again if you opt for prepaid service , they will cancel it on pretext of no response over phone and then deduct cancellation fee from your paid amount. It's a big loot company , don't go for their services.
The AC was damaged during service by UC technician. Now there is no response to my numerous reminders. There is no email or or contact number available. Only a request for call back, which they never do. Really bad service.
excellent
After promising that the service will be provided by today for 3 days then my booking was cancelled providing the reason that the agent is not feeling well. This is highly unprofessional and its like you only do have one professional providing the cleaning service in the whole area. And if the professional is really not well and you only have one professional in the area so convey that same message clearly to the client as well rather than promising regularly to provide the service the same day
nice
Need to respond more quickly but as j booked twice then I received the services.. However very helpful app
Worst service, wait no service at all
best
good job
UC is not reachable at all , they give you missed call follwed up by message that they tried reaching you . You will experience this only when you face any issue .Urban Company has no control over the assigned technicians , carperters etc . Time slot is not adhered , several times the job gets reassigned . It's time to go back to your local , nearby capenters , plumbers etc .
Adding/Saving of addresses is disabled. Pathetic app, if a certain service is not applicable to my area, why bother to show them as available? If it's indeed the case and not a case of faulty app.
My experience with UC was terrible,i called a person to clean bathroom ,his name was dineshan,first if all he came 6hrs late as per the scheduled time and hewas so much in hurry to finish his work,he did such a shabby work n he even asked me for extra money to clean mirrors of bathroom,moreover he was selling me UC cleaning materials and he even did something to the geysers n it stopped working which their customer care people refused to accept n rectify.very very bad service by the UC.
good
Pathetic Service. I saw the Ad in Facebook and booked AC service for ‚Çπ499/-. But when I was checking out they added ‚Çπ49/- Convenience Fee, God knows why ! The quantity of foam used was not even 20% of that shown in the ad. The service personnel said it needs gas recharge and sent an estimate of ‚Çπ2500/-. I rejected it. Next day had to call the local technician who charged ‚Çπ1800/- for that. Sorry, I am not going to try them again.
Services are getting from bad to worse...Extremely untrained random people who they call technicians... They would first find ways and means to mint money... The person went to my home without even calling and started checking without taking the otp...and when he found out he will not get much money...asked me to cancel and after that i did next booking and rescheduled but it also got cancelled. This is when i have taken UC PLUS membership. The feedback is for AC repair service
Just to clean with scented water we are paying 450 rs. They don't even clean the bathroom properly. Domestic workers are far better.
Can anyone senior contact me for my 5 days ongoing issue. The call centre team is behaving like your customers are fool. They don't listen to the customers and let the software handle everything. This is regarding my last order placed 5 days ago.
Bathroom cleaning is very poor, Ur employees are using acid and pathetic duster, ur boys saying that urban company taking 25 percent taking comission than how we use good chemicals
Automatic membership charges applied and can't see even have any benefits of that membership.
Good skilled and good behaved personals and they carry tools of trade as needed.
Pathetic customer support and local unprofessional technicians.
Unprofessional people ruining the reputation of this portal otherwise meant to simplify the processes. Horrible experience with their support teams.
Very good service keep the momentum
UC has an army of some really good professionals.
No need local arrogant peoples
Not ableto download only
Excellent
On Time... Very Good Experience with 3 types of services till date.. AC Services done last 3 yrs continued, concern person is highly recommended from my side. Also good experience with Carpenter services & Washing Machine & Microoven services...
perfect software and team
The technician broke a part while repairing but promised to provide me spare part.After waiting for more than a week,UC didn't provide the spare part.Then when I approached IFB,the IFB technician told that the UC's technician was not skilled enough to operate. There was a screw to open but instead he broke it.Since the spare part is also not available with IFB,my entire Washing machine is useless now.It's a loss of Rs 25000/-. Even after sending photos, UC not responding to my complains.
Worst service no experience candidates...
Had booked for cleaning services and the person scheduled to come didn't turn up. Urban clap team called and told sorry for this. Total rubbish approach. I had travelled for two hours to go to the new apartment and waited for 4 hours.
Even after membership availed, it is always showing service is unavailable and will notify when it's available. What for membership fee collected when service is not available
I booked for ac service, they charge extra money in deep cleaning for Cleaning through foam, but they don't do foam cleaning
I had availed a sofa cleaning service. My sofa fabric got damaged due to the brush used by the professional. There is no way to reach customer care. I have raised request through help center but no one from urban company is acting upon that. Will change the rating if my issue get resolved. Edit: Even after sending email to the mentioned address these people never bother to solve the issue.
Overall bank
After getting three AC serviced, two of them got issues and the third one pcb got damaged. No response from the company. The sevice guy took pcb, display and remote for repair but has not turned back. Being an UC membership, going through all this. The company is not botthering to call even.
very convenient and fast service .
It's not having contact info.
Bad experience during my booking.without doing service. Company cancel my ac service.now I am waiting for refund.
Hi Team, It has been very bad experience with Urban Company. My ac stopped working after getting service from Urban Company. In revisit, engineer told the pcb got short due to their carelessness and inexperience as they run ac immediately without cleaning. Later on i got a call from urban company that they are inexperienced to handle the situation and they will assign SME for the same next day. But SME didnot come. Its like a nightmare for me getting service from urban company. Rohit Dhingra
Wasted my 2 days, saying we are working to assign professional . if you don't have professional then why are you showing available slots.
Booked for furniture assembly. Very unprofessional setup - both the booking and follow up experience.
Aik hafte se me try kar rha hu lekin mujhe app pr professionals available he nahi ho paa rhe h . .. very bad app . I dont like it .
Amazing experience üëç
No customer care support number
So... They didn't provide the service, they didn't provide the full refund What they did provide was a lot of hassle, and an experience of how Indian consumer courts work XD All the best to me. #FightForFullRefund
ok good üëçüèª
Tried thrice and got the worst services
Earlier they used to assign professional beauticians but now randomly they assigns whoever is available. And most of the time you feel like waste of the money and time after receiving the service.
very good
nice
Life saver at times
App is ok the service is atrocious and I have been a customer since last 5 years. Since last few months it's become worst
Worst customer experience i faced recently what they are doing is while applying wallet money it shows service not available at my location and when not apply wallet money it accepts booking i raised this query via mail to their helpdesk even no response yet. Worst customer experience hope they have some value for customers :(
Extremely bad, would never recommend any one to use their service. The workers were rude walked away in 10 minutes brought dirty sponge to clean the flat. A revisist was secluded a week later but conveniently cancelled by them without informing me. I was waiting for the revist and after number of calls get to know due to their personal technical reasons they had cancelled it. No decency to call and inform. I was told they would get back after 48 hrs but got bk on the 6th day.Sad plight. Horibble
After so much of hype created i gave your services a shot. Utterly disappointed with the professionalism shown.My bookings were rescheduled 3 times eventually getting cancelled.i had to adjust my office commitments again and again. Definitely not recommending its services.
Good service for all India Urban company
Very gud service
Nice I like urban company
Worst App Urban company, No customer service number, Increased in charges now since it's summer all the AC service cost is hiked, May be because of Russia-Ukrine warü§£ü§£ü§£
Good
I used bathroom cleaning my bathroom get destroyed. I used ac service my AC is damaged. Really sorry u guys hire unprofessional persons . And give no solution for this. U guys r really unprofessional.
I have taken UC service to install a new split ac. During installation of outdoor unit the service person damaged it. I have raised this concern on the help section but they are not helping me out. It has been around 1 week. Please think twice before taking Urban company service as these service persons are very unprofessional and have very little knowledge of their work.
Services not good
Only mong loss
Bhai log chor company hai yaha aap log ko kaise chu bante hai aap log ko pata nahi yaha par aapko service kam rate pe deke aapke AC ka gas laek hai ya phir ye part kharab hai karke next service me aisa bolkr aapse paisa wasul karte hai Iss company ka mera friend hai jisne mujhe apne compny me tranig ka video dikhya kei customer ko pahle low me service do uske bad usko kaise paise nikalna hai vo batyege isliye plz iss company se dur raho
excellent and trust worthy to get any service
First time took ac servicing from UC and it was really amazing and far better than my earlier experiences of same service from others.
Good service and much satisfied
Fraud ac services
ok ok
Nice
Worst company ever seen, after paying full Payment in advance, again taken 100/- without any reason. Pathetic..... Ridiculous... No words to say.
Worst experience. Could not even get a slot for a simple thing for more than 10 days!!
The worst service in RO water purifier ordered. Despite escalating so many times there is no traction whatsoever and the company is least bothered. The purifier was damaged at the time of installation and no one is bothered to resolve it yet. Every guy who calls just says we will resolve the issue and when we call for a follow up there is no response. I just want to return the product and get my money back.
Good
Booked for AC cooling the guy took the amount but still AC is still not working n cooling properly
Very bad aap because I booked the appointment for ac service but they didn't come.
Don't move this application.. they are least bothered about customers.. I have booked for a carpenter on 21st for 22nd Mar morning 8.00 am but couldn't get any response untill 23rd Mar 12pm inspite of calling customer support. Later an executive called me and told me there is no one in office to schedule the skilled labour..and simply cancelled my booking. Complete day gone for me.. including a day loss of pay!
Disaster to deal with! Booked for AC service. After i paid, suddenly the appointment date changes. The earliest availability is two-three days into the future. When overdue, request from the technician for a few hours delay. No signs of him. I call up, told that company will contact me in half an hour. Nothing from the urban company. I check appointment, and find it rescheduled for another two days later. No phone number to speak to a human. I complain, call back promised in 15 minute. Nothing
Worst don't use,I am lot of problems facing, to bad minimum CUSTOMER responsibility AND MINIMUM PLANNING, only URBAN COMPANY JUST ONE PART, CUSTOMER AND DEALER, just AC installation I am facing 7hrs time,THEY WANT ONLY MONEY üí∞,,,,,,
Watch is not showing accurate no..I think while assembling it missed the exact location.
No one available I tried many times.
Thier services were good. But now I am facing problem. I am UC plus member. I paid for 3 classic bathroom cleaning services. I got 2 services. But UC blocked my 3rd service. I complaint about this, but got no response.
Good service done by technician
Overall good
Verry bad..... Tried since last two days in lucknow but slots available
Worst service. No customer care number to reach in case of any issue. Need to wait for their call back. Doesn't feel value for money now a days... Looking for alternates
excellent
They applied a cancelation fee after the service started because I didn't agree to a change a part which was completely fine and working they are fooling an engineer which designs circuit and know the working of these appliances that's hilarious and how stupid of them ü§£ I really don't recommend so called "Urban Company" for electronics repairs
Good experience please refund for the booking i have cancelled and you have said refund will be credited please check
Horrible service in Ahmedabad...0 star
Fantastic work done technician who represent urban company.
Did not like the Products. Beauticians compel to give 5 star
3rd class company I booked technician for A/C servicing. First of all I have get a slot after 5 days ....It's ok I booked They demand for advance payment I did for 3 a/c and now on the time of slot technician didn't come and replied me to that he is doing his personal ac servicing and he can't come I am uninstall this 3rd class company
For their technical issue also they penalize the customer ... Very much sick of UC...
why you have removed my comments. its pathetic service by Urban compny. they even don't want to receive negetive customer feedback. unbelievable.
Really the service is relaxing and behavior is good.
Good services.
Nice
ü§©
Had a very bad experience with urban company pest control service. Had made it done 2 times and still not satisfied with the results. I am still having cockroaches roaming in my house. Please do not take this service. Totally waste of money and time.
Worst experience
Fake app . They promise of providing service, But after the payment they never care for their customers. Plz donot download their app. Dont waste your time and precious moneyüôè
Good and prompt service
The technician was very good but urban company didn't provide anything to the technician like plastic covers to cover the floor and mattress, wiping clothes to clean the area and ac nothing. just a cleaning foam and nothing else. very very disappointed at urban company üëéüëé
fabulous and excellent
The most horrible experience! The professionals don't turn up. The app doesn't help in taking any action. Nobody from UC team ever calls to rectify issues. Just the most irritating online booking experience so far!
This is an app where you can find group of fools, who do not take anything seriously Their professionals do not arrive as per booking slot They have already charged the money but unable to provide service
I booked a service for my split AC for rs. 548/- . When the technician came, he said the gas needs to be refilled and charged me 3248/- but only got the invoice for rs 548/- that means no warranty for the gas filled. I am trying to contact the customer but pathetic service, no call back yet. I called the technician, he said that was not via urban company. I will vo ahead and complain further. Please don't use this Urban service.
Pathetic service from a so called big company. Firstly gave me an available slot which was 2 days after the booking date but it's already been 5 days and no one has showed at my door. Now telling me that earliest they can arrange the service is after 3 days although slots are vacant even for today if I make a new booking. Very disappointed even after make a complete prepayment.
Very expensive
Excellent service
They were unable to provide their professionals on the scheduled time. Asking customer to reschedule. Even not calling back after written concern.
Excellent Service üëçüëç
Excellent Service
it's good enough
I've booked service for AC servicing but no representative was assigned even after waiting for 2 hours. Why you are running so much advertisement on TV when you are not able to provide services. Total wate of time.
Do not book foamjet servicing from UC. This is a fraud service. There is no foam in this whole process. The person assigned to me says, the foam spray supplied by is a faulty one. It's hardly water. Waste of money
Don't use this app totally unprofessional service no customer satisfaction
Nice work done by UC, fully furnished house cleaning.good app, one platform to all your worries.
I ordered a service ,and they cancelled abruptly
good service provider
Amazing
They fool customer Don't use service Don't use subscription
good and excellent work
Very useful.. and very professional
Urban clap is failed to serve the prime members back to back. No compensation no apology. Very unprofessional behavior. I want my membership refund and the compensation for wasting my 2 weekends.
good
Good experience with service, useful app
The first service was supposed to be free which I did not get. Rest is very good.
Good

Worst experience
Good services
We had repaired washing machine and the service was awesome and they resopnded immediately within 2 hours since we had been calling our local servicemen for repair but they kept delaying our request for about 3 weeks but uc had immediately responded and done the work flawlessly! The cost was also affordable.
Fantastic
Great üëç
nice experiance of use the urban service for my ac service.
Bad service experience: They take the money in advance but don't assign professional, and then call up to reschedule the booking... Every time! Why on earth would a person want to reschedule the booking!!! And time slots are provided by them, not us #Cheaters. Professional was not assigned on provided slot yesterday, then booking was rescheduled for today 1pm, and now it's 2.30pm but booking is still not confirmed. Also awaiting call that was informed 1.5 hours back.
EXCELLENT SERVICE
Excellent work
Bogus App dont book any Service from from this app, their Mechanics are frauds. They will ask you to cancel booking and then charge double triple. Company has worst Customer Complaint support. Its Better to Search for Local mechanics.
Booked for ac service twice on app, technician dint turn up... Pls don't pay for annual membership as they don't refund the amount even if the technician don't turn up, u get refund only for the service booked amount... I had informed them to refund my amount as technician dint turn up but they denied... Nice way of making money without providing service. Highly disappointed
Aircooler repair is still pending even after rescheduling twice on assigned Engineer request to arrange the spare part.... Worst this is there is no real time UC call back number customer can reach out. Disappointed
its seems UC interest is only booking order not resolving problem that's why the have created so many service categories and if I book one service technician is stick to same and refuse to fix the problem.I booked AC service there was low gas the technician simply refused and told me since I have booked for service they cannot fix other problem , please stop making customer Fool, he was in hurry taking other task, basic gas refilling is expected with ac service without any separat booking
Pathetic service by urban company. My booking was for Saturday 3:30 pm. Technician didn't visit. Raised complaint but customer care didn't bother to call me back. Simple keep closing it mentioning not able to contact me for next two days. Did big mistake by choosing urban company instead of local technician. Will never recommend anyone for urban company.
Third class service, I am not happy with urban clap, They not provide good service, Don't waste your time.
There is no value for customer time. If any of your customer booked a service with a designated time slot and if you are not able to provide any service on time then isn't it ur duty to atleast inform us with the reason. I am just waiting that u will allote the service guy from quite couple of hours. If u dont have the team then why u take the orders.
A true Companion
Most unprofessional and useless service provider. They just charge extra in the name of professional services where as services and products used by them is third category. Many better option available apart from UC
Hated the service in Jamshedpur really waste, had to wait for three days for ac service but the technican did not come for service got it rescheduled for three days. Finally uninstalled the app.
very reliable and skilled workers is the best thing in Cities. Urban Clap has been providing excellent services so far .
Good
This company has zero integrity ripping off their workers across all platforms from electrical engineer to hairstylist robbing their money and time. Never Use Who Encourage modern Day slavery
Professional are not signed even after the timing being fixed. And there is no way to speak customer care. We will have to wait for them to call and all you can is text from them saying we tried contacting you but couldn't. This kind of service was not expected from urban company. I am going to uninstall the app right away
I booked for ac servicing 6 day ago for today,but they couldn't allot service person
excellent
Awesome work...very professional does what it promises for the customer.very user friendly app.
Superb all in one service
professional outlook and service.Dedicated staff who knows their work well.
Excellent service
Nice service at affordable rates
Unprofessonal technician. incomplete service .said he does not know how to do service
Worst app
She is very nicely done her work, keep it up & stay like this üëçüëåüëåüëåüëå
Urban Company, No ethics, No professionalism, No quality standards, No way to reach customer care unless they called us, Money focused. Generally anyone choose Urban Company for hassle free, unnecessary followup, cost etc., but my suggestion would be even if the price is little high than the Urban Company, please try to get the services from there. Urban Company is just a cheater. Don't trust it. They will take money before work starts and if anything happens we need to wait for their calls.
Excellent
Recieved water purifier service, bathroom and kitchen cleaning and pain relieve massage.... All services excellent
Good service persons
service is good
Pathetic experience, urban company rescheduled my booking without any intimation,
Really Appreciate The executives Hard work implied in servicing your our equipment.. Keep Up the Good Work..‚úåÔ∏è
Had a very bad experience with the booking of a mechanic for fan repair. The mechanic doesn't turn up despite calling him and when requested for a reschedule with Urban company, they give a booking after 2-3 days. How do they even think I can survive this heat without a fan. Do not consider UC for mechanic bookings. It's pathetic
very nice
good professional service in pune
Easy to use app. Clear demarcation of tasks. Professionals are well trained and courteous . So far experience with this app and overall service has been excellent.
App works fine but actual services are extremely pathetic
General AC service was excellent. I never expected as usually done in past by various service provider. cleaning of AC as well of bath room was quite good, a lot of dust n dirt, was cleaned, which was remains since long even after regular service.
Very bad service by urban clap booking done but no service technician so all user kindly ignore this due to wrost service
Hi UC Team, I am very disgusted with your services. I booked an AC service on 20.03.2022 and made the payment for the service to be scheduled on 26.03.2022. Much to my surprise the technician denied to come. When UC team was contacted they rescheduled the service but again no one came. Now your team is saying that no one is available to provide service. If thats the case then why did you accept the booking/payment 6 days prior and still could not manage to arrange a technician in 6 days.pathetic
I have'nt got the opportunity to use your any of the services, but I need your services for cleaning my 3 window A/Cs during first week of April. I have heard much about your service qualities and I have decided to engage you for cleaning ACs. After this I may engage in domesti requirement. Shall be glad to hear from you whether you can help me or not, if yes when,please confirm . Thanking you. N. Dasgupta, 262, Dakshinsyan Apartments Plot no 19, Sector -4, Dwarka,
super
Pathetic..is the word..they have all local goons appointed as technician..came for looting the customer..and I think urban clap is also having commision from them.In app they show very less cost or rates for the service but actually when final bill comes it will be all surprised.i have been cheated by them more than two times and now I will never call them.local technicians are far better.If you really want to be in trouble take their service.
Excellent service by technicians
This video consultation is a great initiative by Urban Company. My first consultation almost solved my problem. Second consultation gave me an overview of the problem so that I could decide whether to go ahead for service or not and the rough cost estimate. Thank you very much for the service. I strongly recommend every one to utilise this opportunity.
Good Keep it upüëçüëèüëå
OUTSTANDING ‚ù§
Getting experienced professionals without wasting time
Good service
Horrible experience...the worst app for booking any service.zero star also not deserving
good service
If UC unable to Provide AC service as per the Slot available then why didn't remove this option from App. I have wasted my 2 days. It's seems lack of management and Policy.
Very good service provider.
Very good service provider. Value for money. May go for it.
Very satisfying
The rates mentioned while booking a service and the final bill after completing service was different in all three bookings till now. It makes me re think about using the services of this app. Feeling ripped off.
Looting money. Money minded people
Urban company make their customers fool,they don't have any professional for visit ,for last three day they are rescheduling time only even in gurgaon area bad service. Never recommend
Unprofessional service. Keeps on cancelling the service at the last moment
my first experience with UC. It was smooth and great. AC cleaning person came in the scheduled time and performed his task as expected.
Pathetic service inspite of having plus membership they didn't provide timely service. I rescheduled many times due to lack of service providers. Still they are taking bookings without serving. I don't know why they charge for prime membership. If you can't provide service on time.
good service
Emergency services are never available and there is no instant chat support service.
nice
This is a useless buggy app , please hire some good engineers . So many lags in the app ,plus so many payment bugs . When using post pe offer to pay ,I'm not getting the postpe option in payment methods , even not accepting post pe card , when used cred pay offer for payment ,white screen appears and nothing happens . In that time the slots are not available anymore . Pathetic experience , waiting for a competitor for this app.
Worst after service issue resolution, techinician will not lift the phone and respond even after 2 days. And customer care will not call after 15 min they call at their willing providing no assurance why the technician is not turning-up. Not recommended
Any time unavailable to location n charges to high very bad experience...üò±üò´üëéüê¢üê£
They have become pathetic over time. Query resolutin time is pathetic. They say will call in 15 mins, but no call for 3 4 days. Sometimes they just cancel scheduled call. Good opportunity for someone else to enter
Professionals are not arrived on time..What is advantage of plus membership?More than 2 days passed but they have not professional and not sending..Taking conveyence fee minimum order fee training fees cancellation charges etc but when comes time for their ontime service..Always failed.What will they do? write us on this email id..contact through help center..We are arranging etc..
Excellent service
Worst scheduling experience, they don't even check with the available professionals to schedule at the given time slot. Once scheduling done they will cancel the booking stating professional not available.
Poor booking experience hight of disappointment.
Good app and professional service
Worst experience. Customer care service gave me half an hour time they will call me back now it's 3 to 4 hours till know doesn't got any clarification or update from cc.
Highly Satisfied with the services
nice
price too high
Professional services!
Worst service professional cancelled befor 10 mins and no other slots available how if someone wants service on time and end moment cancelled don't want to trust again
GOOD SERVICE AND Excellent WORK ..
wish I could give negative reviews... unprofessional technicians... Cheats.... Technician took away 1800/- seperately for AC gas and now the AC is not working at all... Claimed warranty revisit, they scheduled it with same tech..He called up and said will have to pay 2500/- extra for the issue... Whereas he never revisited.Requested to arrange different tech...He refused to visit.Raised callback request 3 hrs back..No call till 2.5 hrs n after that they called up n said we will call bk again
very nice service. service persons was very professional.
Best service experience
Mixed experience but preference on the satisfactory side more as the haircut professional did a wonderful job for my father
Very good company.
Very poor response , expect you to pay first without honouring any commitment
App bohut acha hai useful hai..
company have olso taken work with labour work withmateril also
excellent work
rajeev kumar for bathroom cleaning was good and polite
Very good service
Great Company
Not recommended, no transparency, not much benefits of having the membership, no direct customer support number, first raise a query then they will call you, the professional who comes for the work tries to do self promotion and then scam you, one must not rely on them too much, it's all about luck!!
Useless .they don't deliver service on promised time and do not respond to complaints also . Second time in last few months service not delivered on time and no repsonse
AC SERVICING IS JUST FABULOUS. We were paying roughly the same amount earlier to the local AC servicing guy but results were not so impressive. Last year when we opted for UC we were spectical about the quality of service but it turned out to be Outstanding. I would definitely try other services provided on UC soon
PLUS membership is WASTE OF MONEY. DoNT buy it. Only PAY after TAKING service. CUSTOMER schedule doesn't matter for UC also their STAFF didn't cancel even when they are Denying the service after ACCEPTing it
What they show as ads and what they actually does are completely different things. Simply wasted my money and time on their service.
till now all worthy services ..I recommend 100%
I booked for ac service and the service started on 24th Mar. The working AC got damaged during service and now uc is asking me to pay for the damages. The customer service team never responds and after paying money to uc I am left with an ac which doesn't work. This is the second time it's happening. Nobody should have such a horrible experience hece I urge others also to not use this good for nothing company unless you are ready to go to consumer forum.
My experience with urban company is wonderful. Best service ever...must go with urban company
very costly very bad
Chor ka bachcha h.... installation keliye Ac ka 6000rs lia
Worst experience they accept order after that never fulfilled our request. Never believe them for your important functions. They are not capable to manage orders.
Nice app and excellent service. Can u add tailors as well
Unethical technicians... kindly avoid using UC and directly take service from the manufacturing company.
Bahut gandi company
Worst experience, they do not respond and resolve issues
Very good service
really very happy with service
I am a UC Plus member, while booking the service the slots are only available if you pay the full amount online. Then there won't be any professional available for the booked slot. After few hours when no professional is assigned someone will call from Urban Company and with a commanding they will say that no professional is available for next 3-4 days and they will reschedule the booking after 4-5 days. If we cancel the booking then again the refund will take next 5-7 days to process.
Unfairly charged amount was given back as wallet money. And now the wallet money has expired. After raising multiple complaints, there has been no response. How can someone's hard money in wallet they can expire, it's not like a cash back or promo money. Really poor in responding to customer grievances.
they did a good job, above expectation
I am very much disappointed from your service. Your so called professional came for ac servicing, damaged the ac motor and went away saying he will come next day. It's been 3 days he is not even picking up call nor you all are doing something. What am i supposed to do now.
Worst service
Very bad experience.. Not arrived at time.. And very bad service.. I had never expected this from such a wide used app.. üòûüòû
I am trying to book for washing machine repair but always showing no professional available. But just two streets away my friend house for him it is showing. Then what is the use of this services when we not getting services everywhere. Uninstalled the application already.
Perfect...
The service person should be little more politeness.
Great
Their call back service is so poor that they say they will call back in 11-15 minutes but they call after 5 hours. They very purpose of this is lost.
Poor Service and Customer Handling. Fraud and clever professionals, No customer service number at all. They fool customers and never refund the correct amount as well. No ownership and responsibility of work. Unmatured staff and pathetic exp with UC
Good
UC is great.
Loved it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Even after the booked slot is crossed, professional is not assigned nor you will get a call for the update. There is no way to talk to customer support as well. Such a worst experience and never recommend to other's
Urban company provides good services and chooses professionals according to the services we require. Very helpful to have service at your doorstep.
Good App but Costly for AC Service
It was good
well done üëè
Total worst sevice no complaint solution charges are just double then market and work is too delay please don't use it
excellent
excellent
Now a days UC not providing proper services Even customer care also not replying to calls Worst experience ever , don't go with UC in Hyderabad
Pathetic service, service Engineer didn't come even after the scheduled time. Even the Urban company help is unresponsive.
The guy is really good. I recommend him for his laborious job. The man is really very superb on his duty, very punctual and very devoted. He cleaned my bathroom very well and removed 95 % ( 20 years old stain mark) and now it looks really new. Thank you very much urban company and Gouranga Sarkar for this excellent service. Again I will book this service after two months.
Thanks for your service. Excellent work.
Amazing service
Pathetic service, can't handle scale on ground. Reality is very different from shiny attractive catchy TV advertisements.
amazing
my booking cancelled .
Option should be provided where one can choose between services of classic and premium products.
Poor Invoicing Total bill - 698 Membership discount - 100 Paid amount- 598 Payment pending - 100 ( i dont know where you guys learned math, I am happy to take addition, subtraction classes, if required. I requested to check invoices and payment 2 times. The team said there is pending. 26Mar-if u r lucky you will get the partner by ur 10th reschedule. They train partners not to care. Fun part-you pay convenience for the training! Go UC!
I opted for service of 2 AC. They cleaned through water jet only. UC Billed for foam cleaning but the person denied for foam clean. During installing the AC they broke the plaster of wall and argued that it is common in window AC servicing. Not cleaning done after service was done properly. Denied service for 2nd AC due to reason of low gas in compressor. Instead asked to repair and extra charges. So cancelled my remained service. Very worst experience and will never suggest anyone for UC...
this time services are not upto the standard I booked the slot of 1pm and after a lot of writing my service was done at 0635 pm
AC indoor unit got broken while uninstalling AC, worst service.
Very good We
3rd class experience... Already paid full amount while booking online services... When professional came... Said change in rate Card... Want extra amount... Pitatic WILL NEVER RECOMMEND SOME already taken exclusive membership... That money also waste...
üëé
Worst app. Don't depend on this.
excellent
Worst experience,no time bound ,all time reschedule ur booking
Do not take there service I have booked a spa and on assigning the professional they call me an told me they cannot come to my place. I reschedule my appointment again and again thrice.... Then finally with a pathetic service. I cancelled my appointment and requested for a refund. Since 16th of March I am yet just waiting for my refund. The call centre is even more pathetic they tell you to raise a call and the call is never intended back to you my refund is yet pending till date.
Professional work, polite behavior, reasonable prices
Its was really great platform
Every thing is not available.
Urban company is not a customer friendly now. I have booked 3 ACs service 3 days in advance and schedule was at 1.30pm today. Suprisingly, no technician was assigned and calls were not responding. Many reminders sent for details but in vain. Later, i came to know the booking status resolved by Urban by cancelling it. What a tragedy of UC supportü§≠ please beware of using Urban as their service support is pathetic.
please let two options be available both salon and hair
I little bit confused about the spare parts price. I think they take excess price of spare parts. Maybe I am wrong. But i want to know a AC water tray pipe price of Rs-700. It's maybe too high.
very politely behaviour
Booked an appointment in morning for 5 PM slot. At 4:45 i get a message that appointment has been cancelled. Very unprofessional customer support. Don't use this app
satisfied. if asked, definitely suggest UC for ac service.
Did house painting using uc, the quality was very poor , and supervisor is not replying now
Good. Recently I scrolled through CCTV category. I'm surprised to see that UC is promoting a Chinese govt owned CCTV company HikVision.
Best service
I have booked AC servicing on 26.03.2022. Professional named Ajmer misbehaved with my old aged parents and refused to do the servicing. Threatened my parents.
Worst experience. Professional never gets assigned and the customer care team really dont care to callback
Cheater people charge me 6750 and still my a.c valve. Fit damage valve now i dont.have cooling due to gas leackge. Nobody answer me and even want to charge more. This company is proffesional cheater fraud and criminal.
couldnt clean a bathroom. lazy people dont want to work... money minded
At the time of payment they are offering 200 cash back on first AC servicing after payment till date not yet credited So may I request you to don't believe this type cheating but urban clap not respond my calls and feedback This type of corporate cheating am not expect
User Friendly
The app is not working it's not opening only nor logging in what to do
No profrssion support by Back end support
The company doesn't have control over its professionals. The professionals are not ethical, they doesn't have any issue even if we give complaints against them. Even some professional ask for extra money without any extra work done but the company as usual are not aware and no actions is taken even after complaints. Better to uninstall the app.
Never use this app for expensive electrical appliances. Technician will empty the gas in AC and Fridge, then will give you a huge bill. It is the technician way of making more money.
Awesome
Wrost service. It's 2 hour late still professional not come and complaint twice but did not receive call back yet. TAT is 15 min.. I am plus member too
Pathetic service , specially house cleaning team.
Satisfied with the repair service. Technician / carpenter attended the job as per schedule. It is first experience with Urban Company.
Superb Service...Very polite and professional staff...
charging extra from the coustomer
Cheat and loot company never ever using services of urban company ,doing unfair practices
Horrible Experience. Just keep on rescheduling the service. If you don't have enough professional to assign then why do you take bookings and torture the customer ?? Useless and time waste.
12.30 PM AC service not attended. Customer service gave false assurance that they are arranging shortly. Still no show
Quick n excellent service
Technicians are converting customers to their own work stations.
Every time they ask for excuses. Not at all puntual. Every time same experience.... They are unable to assign parterners on time... After many reminders also the company unable to assign professional. How they are giving ads without any fear a big question mark.. Worst response from customer care also. Uncapable persons in a good designed company...
No services for water purifiers, aquaguards, etc
Useless services....First, they rescheduled my service request for 2-3 times and then they insist me to cancelled it. Just wasted my time. Not recommended to anyone.
excellent service
nice app
Done everything as expected.
Very much unprofessional...underskilled people hired by them...if possible I would give them zero star...booked service of air conditioner but they left the gas pipe of my a.c. opened...lodged a complaint...but they didn't call me back on stipulated period and not even bothering to answer at all. You just corrected your time of call but again failed to your commitment. Horrible... I will wait another 30 minutes and after that I will go to consumer forum...
Excellent üëç
Very nice app its useful
Waste of money
Extremly unprofessional. Delayed services, no respect for someone elses time and money. Never recommending for deep cleaning services.
Excellent quality of work
Ac mechanic didn't used foam for washing of ac grill which company claim, even mechanic had not temprature measuring meter, so ac service is not so worthwhile as shown in advertisement, prefer a local technician . My very very bad experience.
My refund ID 41753790 NOT YET TRANSFFERED TO MY BASE BANK.SEND WITHIN 24 HOURS OR FACE LEGAL CONSEQUENCE ASPER RBI GUIDELINE AND CASE FILE FROM CONSUMER FORUM.
training required
Poor and fraud
Their do called professionals for cleaning services always reach late. They automatically charge for their annual premium membership without taking permission and then the service provided is poor.
very good service done by payal
AC damaged by technician 3 days ago, but no resolution till date. Only calls from call centre to accept the complaint
I'm trying to contact costomer care there no response
Beautician was good but in kit facial cream was very less for facial check it out increase it's quantity please thanks
She was so good and polite well experienced felt so good must try Mrs Preeti
Proffessional is late by 4 hr he is nt even telling how late he is, also I asked help from urban company none is responding me , my whole is is wasted just waiting for technician, also urban company imposing fine if u cancel the order .. really it would be better if I go with othe app or local vendors, really disappointed painful service by urban company ...
Good Service
While I have no issues with the quality of work done by the technician, you need to improve your customer interface by giving us option to call and speak instead of messaging. That would help us to air our grievance directly. Call centres are of no use and you should provide mailing option also both electronic and print. Don't hide behind anonymity.
Company has stupid professionals
Service is Pathetic. Booked slot for 10:30 and its 1:00 and nobody is here. Raised an issue in the app but No call from urban Company support. Just Pathetic service
Overall it's a good service but prices are on bit higher side
Good behavior
Good
We had asked to repair tubelight and the switch and the electrician gave us duplicate bill however the prices mentioned on the product is lesser then what they had mentioned in the bill. If we wouldn't have cross checked they would have easily cheated. As we had already paid them advance and when asked for refund they started arguing with us and went away and didn't even tell us where did they procured the material from! Just hate hate hate this fraud!! Please stay away from these guys..
Useless
very nice job
Non responsive customer service and rude professionals. Update: After taking multiple other services, I feel they are doing a good job of it.
AC Service
excellent work
They dont have contact number, they keep rescheduling the technician visit since last 5 days.... Shameful
promt service
Good service
Stop sending un necessary sms, I have give 5 star, I have reted many times, I am using your services but now your un necessary sms are irritating me.
nice service
Urban Company.....tall claims....and hopeless service...worst than a local guy working for you...coz if something goes wrong UC just backs out and you will be caught up in the loop of approvals of corporate offices and work will never be done...and then they will stop answering your calls and the job will be left open as it is......but atleast local vendor will reply and take the responsibility of work done and get it rectified...my case is related to my A.c. which damage of rs 13000
Extremely bad experience with the so called professionals and the customer service team. Even after booking a week in advance, they ask me to reschedule at the time of service. Beware of the membership fees they ask. It's just a scam as it's non-refundable even if you don't like the services.
hi, team this is not acceptable. when i booked for ac service payable amount was showing rs 448 and post service invoices genrated with payable amount rs598.
great work. clean n neat
Good üëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
foam wash not done...foam spray was not working...inlt water service has done...waste of money
Unprofessional to the core. The appointments are not honored and we will have to adjust with the new timings that they suggest which typically happens after 2 days. And, it is on us to follow up. Considering the amount of time spent waiting for the professional and to follow up with the Customer care, I would rather depend on other service providers, or do the work myself instead of depending on Urban Company.
No spares available for RO purifier of UrbanCompany and service keeps getting cancelled

UC is a great place for salon services as I have not used other provided services. They are there with you till the job is completed.
excellent
overall good
Your AC mechanics in lucknow are cheats. They charge over and above service charges for work which is already part of the service work.
Really expensive, and quality of work is utterly pathetic
Worst ever service. Making customer fool. No service provided.
Not provide sufficient daily leads waste of subscription plans in juhu hub false comment giving by urban company don't buy a plan
Unprofessional people are hired to work and no customer service provided. My refund is stuck for over a month. One top of it they lie about unable to connect with me! Shameful!
My ac went bad after 10 days of service. Won't recommend to anyone
Technician is never available in my area though i live in the heart of a metropolitan city and after seeing the reviews on play store I am happy that i did not get a time slot.
My first experience with you and it turn out to be the last. I had booked TV installation for 48+ inches. The carpenter assigned to me was 4.86 star rated came on time. I was confident enough seeing his reviews, but the moment he started working he looked confused as how to proceed. I did shown him few videos and left him on his own as I had office calls. One and half hour later when he finished his job it was a complete mess and he told me to call UC for another guy before he left. :)
They don't have their services in nizambad ..i was looking for home services
Will give - (minis) 10 ratings this app... Worest service üêï‚Äçü¶∫ They didn't discuss anything. After 1 week they simply cancel my order & refund the amount. They give adds in web & social media but they could not provide services to customers
After I booked a service for my ac. The man came to our house... The first thing he said, that we need to charge gas in ac. He said if take gas from urban clap it will cost around 3000 He offered me to take gas from him personally which would cost under 1000 to me. I refused. He just did the cleaning part and left. That day my ac worked properly, but from next day.. Ac is not cooling .. Even after keeping it on for 30 mins continues . . I am just not happy with the service.
I have first done ac service that was very good then i booked aqua ro service the person can and done the service next day the water taste was very bad that i claim warranty than no response i have to cancel the booking and i hired some one from local . Urban company is only good for ac services as my experience.
Bad experience why now there is no cash on delivery and AC service mechanic are available 3 to 4 day.
Good service
Service is worst.today my ac repair was scheduled at 5.30pm on 25/03/22. No service professional came,and no respnse from service personnel and uc.they simply cancelled my booking without my knowledge. They are telling no technicians available for tomorrow also. But in there app all slots are available for tomorrow. They are just cheating and making fool to customer.i have screen shot of available slots for tomorrow with date and time.just now at 10.40pm i checked.they are simply shame less....
They never arrive on time. No one recieve the call. I cancelled booking
Very Poor service, even after prior booking the desk manager called and said that no technician was available in the booked time slot He Provided the next available slot which was again not fulfilled as the technician was still not available üòë Very disappointed and not going to use urbancompany services in the future.
Very good.. First experience it was the best experience. I will highly recommend this app. But only lacking in this is Bridal makeup and saree draping and hair for marriage, if that is there it is a perfect destination for all ladies
Pricing should be affordable
nice service
Was doubtful when saw the videos on youtube.. But.. Excellent job.. Unbelievably clean.. Though light colored sofas..!!
Really the professionals of the Company are professionals in true meaning. Nice job performance by them.
We had booked an AC repairman. He arrived 40 hours late. Failed to fix the problem, made it worse and demanded hidden surcharges that doubled the pre-paid prices. He also demanded that we book Servicing and Gas refill and refused to come back. He also behaved in a very misogynistic manner and refused to talk to the person who booked his services, instead speaking to me, a man. If we do not get a response here, we will be compelled to approach the Consumer Court to seek redressal.
There was some incorrect invoice.However customer care helped to fix it.
I used UC service in Gurgaon which was excellent but after moving to vizak I found that the equipments & procedure used in Gurgaon is missing here & hence quality is poor. This is in regard to sofa cleaning.
I am very disappointed that time i am your regular customer. I am following up for last 2 days. One person came and he damaged all indoor outdoor ac unit and another person come he said i can't do work because first person already open all parts and not assemble again. Now tell me who will bear this all expenses...
Good job
very disappointing experience, nothing like customer support system, no one connected in-spite of repeated requests raised for help needed
Very very bad experience with them, booked a ac service but no one came even none of the person assigned for the service, customer service is pathetic. I called customer care thrice but nobody pick the call when I raised my complaint on app they showed that our team will contact you soon.
Service of AC was good but I had to reschedule my appointment as they could not provide me with technician on appointment day, so be ready to reschedule
Good
Urban
great job done
Nice work
Availed first service with Urban Clap. Very excellent service.
very bad experience.. payment kam bta ke jyada lete hai . or koi customer care ki suvida bhi nhi h..urban company ke jhanse me na aaye ye froud hai ..inse bach ke rhe...call back ke liye request lete hai but call nhi karte..bewkoof bnate hai
Ac service done accurate but in video they shows foam and jet spray wash but foam not applied
Completely bitter. Assigned representative Shyamal Das came and asked for extra money personally. Inspite of that problem was not solved ultimately.
Last three days my app is not working..
Useless customer service.
Pathetic app, i tried 5 times to book a slot for ac service. But i didn't get any slot.
I haven't received the tv back and the professional says it will take time. The technician belongs from a fraud company called service guru in Pune Hadapsar. I just hope he doesn't damage the tv in any other way because we asked him to return it back. I don't know how urban company hires such technicians
Polite, calm & friendly nature..best service
After 6 days I got slot and then also there is no professional assigned for my work. Worst application. Recommendation NOT to use this application. No professionalism in this app. It's like a local vendor.
I feel they should consider reducing the service cost, especially who do it occasionally like me. Though it is giving good service for bathroom cleaning have to take care of toilet clean.. Atleast take extra charge of Rs.48/-
perfect service
I would say it is a mixed experience. I get great services for AC servicing, Water purifier servicing, men's Hair cut. But for bathroom cleaning, I didnot find any different between the basic cleaning and 10x cleaning. Now, do not beat up the professional, he did his duty really well. I think it is you who should provide better chemicals, tools for tiles and basin/commod.
To be frank the rates are high compare, if we consult the persons directly.but the urban service is excellent. we find everything at one stop.
This is the worst app ever. Kindly do not use this. Rather this this there areany apps available providing similar type of services. They are zero on their commitment and neither the service person are any professionals.
I am a regular user for the services that are included in urban company app, i availed almost all services, plumbing, carpentry, geyser service, ac service, ac Installation, unInstallation, electrical work, house deep cleaning .. when i look at all these i can say one thing what ever services you are looking for with good service, everything is available from the comfort of your home, no waiting you can choose your flexibility time to make the work done. I am totally satisfied ..
Worst worst worst App plz do not try this app it takes very long time to assigned technician
Unprofessional, not punctual about the time. Does not respond to any call .
Total chor company! The technician who came for water purifier servicing removed a jumper cable when i wasn't looking to force me into buying new filters. UC instead of compensating me for this told me to book another service to rectify the issue. Never book anything frm urban company. They just want ur money üòë
I had booked servicing of 2 AC units as per the rate that day and paid in full. When the technician arrived for service, app was showing he has added sone repair worth Rs. 300/. I asked him what is the issue and he said there is no issue and that Urban Company has increased the price of service as of yesterday. I was appalled that how can they charge me extra when I booked and paid already based upon applicable rate day before yesterday. Either Urban or their technician is looting the customer.
Excellent
For the last 3-4 weeks, the app doesn't allow customers to book professionals they have tried before. Only a random new profesional is assigned. Since there is no customer care number to contact the team and the Help Center on the app is pretty much useless, any issue I raise is closed without even a message or call, and remains unresolved. As of this morning, the app also has no slots available for any service and any service area I pick. Time to uninstall and move on to better services.
Bad experience
AC cleaning service is just great!! More than what I had expected.
I had a good experience of Jet service of AC with Cleaning foam.
good
they are Charing additional amount by said COVID is there but it's not
Worst app and service ever. I live in New Delhi, the capital of our country and still the service is not available. Every time I try to book an appointment it shows " Our professionals for this location are busy". What a pathetic service you are providing to your customers. Never though of such a bad experience with a company like UC.
Not even able to book appointment for AC service. Completely wastage of time .
Exorbitant pricing for services available at half the price.. Professionalism doesn't mean only wearing uniform, it should be seen in the work done..( got deep cleaning done for my 4bhk house, unsatisfactory results) (just for installation of my AC I paid my local technician 850rs and got it done perfectly including a bit of drilling and gas refill. Whereas urban company asked for 1650 for the same.?? I don't understand why so much extra..
Bunch of frauds who are pushing this membership and not focusing on service quality. Local vendors offer much better service. Update: Issue has been addressed professionally.
Worst service app and even worst team of people I regret wasting 2days worth of time waiting for the so called professional to came and in the end I canceled
very good
just wow
Very poor service. I have booked for AC service on 20.3.22 for 25.3.22 (11.30 AM). But on 25.3.22 they did not assigned any professional for it and said that they will send the professional on 31.3.22.
If we are acquiring for membership the price will be less depends on availability, in my case I have membership account which shows one service as 350 and my wife's account is non member it shows 499 for one service. The main twist she is able to book the service for current day or future dates for same location I'm not able see any slots and it shows me it will be notified when staff are available and it never notified me as of now. If you need service better don't acquire membership.
Disgusting
Very bad experience. You can't rely either on their professionals or help centre. The professional refused to visit for the booking and every after several complaints there was no response from the HC. Finally had to cancel the booking as no same day provided. You just can't rely on them for urgent situations.
Worst service... Do hell with your chindi company
Good for working professionals
good service for variety of house problems
Very worst compay as they dont have a cystomer care to talk or chat and more over dont go for multiple service as i have a better experiance with the second free service for which they have raised a bill of 299.
Very Good one
This company is fraud.. took money 8000 and never provided service... they are thief and looted hard money... never take there chief service.. the other chef Vincent is a big thief stolen money and ran away... be alert from this fraud company ...
Unable to book service through Urban Company
it took multiple visit but they got the job done.
Best service app ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôè
very good polite efficient service
Nice
I booked an AC service and they gave me a slot after 3 days and after that they cancelled my booking saying that due to glitch slot is booked and now we don't have booking slot... Joker's
Three times i booked for spa and three times professional was not assigned ..... Very poor service...... Letting customer to suffer ...... No response from uc customer care after made a complaint also..... Very bad experience...... Will not refer to anyone...
Now worst service provider ever.. Charge is also too high.. And professionalism is missing..
Expertise with precise efficiency.
best service ever
Worst Service My AC failure after service pls don't use
I HAVE BOOKE MY AC SERVICE 2DAYS BEFORE ACCORDING TO ITS PORTAL SLOT BUT THEY CANT ASSIGNED A SINGLE TECHNICIAN TILL DATE. EVERY TIME THEY CALL AND RESHECHDULE MY BOOKING. I ALREADY PAID AMOUNT AND STILL WAITING FOR MY AC SERVICE. BAD APP AND BAD EXOERIANCE I HAVE FACE.
Shock observors replaced by uc professional which he brought outside as uc doesn't have inventory and after waiting for 2-3 days and so no warranty. From Feb we r following up with imran(Bangalore) on fixing shock observers. The machine is moving a lot and shock observers must be wrong or not fixed properly b4. Now warranty expire. How to proceed? I feel if something goes wrong thn beter to replace it instead of fixing it. None of the refrigerator, washing machine, chimney, geyser related good.
Laptop service not provided in my region, Mumbai. Start it so I can give 5 stars.
Servicing of my A.C. done by Urban Company professional up to my entire satisfaction.
Once it was good. But, now-a-days it's all pathetic service and poor quality products used. Oh, btw all the executives insist on 5 star rating by sweet talking for the pathetic services (some were good though). Till date I've given 5 star to all the executives but when I checked my rating it was 3.7 , and boy oh boy how would it make me feel, even I'm the one paying for the services and am being rated poorly.. take my money treat me poorly.. nice way of punching yourself in the face.
The video you show on your app nowhere matches the service offered including the raw material used
Refund credited and received phone to help resolution of issue.... Really nice
Worst ac service. One of the ac parts broke and the technician refused to change it. Thank god he himself checked before starting the service that ac was working fine. The ac started to give noise. Would not recommend anyone to have an ac service.
My first experience with UC and the service was simply hassle free.
When you are not able to arrange technicians on time as per alloted time then why you are wasting someone's time, even you r providing prepaid service, then what is the purpose of this app,??? Don't belive this app and waste your time for your needs and money. Worst service even at a metro city.
Waste i have booked bathroom cleaning they dont done properly they are not using machines..waste
Unprofessional workers
The app was fantastic üòÅ
Good Service
Falsely advertised for RO service when I booked on 19th march,2022, they couldn't provide a suitable technician. One who was assigned, he himself cancelled the booking.
Work is perfect technician is polite and professional
If u don't give services in our state or district then why u people publish this app in playstore.. üò°üò°üò°üò°
Poor service in Kanpur
Yesterday I booked professional fot hair cut. Neither the professional came nor an intimation from Urban Company.
These companies scrwed up my RO.. Post asking for refund to the bank account I'm yet to get it. On top of that now they have also added a cancellation charge on my account. Pathetic service and app. Account Name: Sanath Kumar V
Worst app even a service..called many times but no response from there side..giving excuses about vehicles repairing.. pathetic executerors..
Why you are giving advertisement and the major city of Tirupati there has no service in renigunta I am really unhappy
Professional approach
Don't use this service no customer care
Their professionals are always busy.
Horrible..!!! Disappointed..!! Unprofessional..!! Download UC app and you're done..!!! Book an appointment and you're gone..!!! No one turn up.. No call from the company.. No response to emails..!! AC service & Repair was a nightmare with this company. They don't have customer service number and they don't responsd to emails. Totally SHAME..!!! Will never use their service.
I booked AC servicing appointment for my 5 air conditioners. The tech suppose to come on Thur however no one shoed up after raising complaint and waiting for hours, I got a call and he promised that a technician will come on Friday however tech mentioned today the area is incorrect and he cannot come. This is most pathetic service I have received
It's my boundation you give star that's the only reason one star is coming in view otherwise this company and app deserves zero star... Really annoyed with the fact that no professional was assigned to me and even after that no other updates were given regarding delay... Even on filling a written complain on their app no replies... For this I really want to sue them in consumer court for wasting my precious time...
At Guntur: If you provide cleaning machines, your cleaning guys would do great. Without cleaning machines they are already doing good job!!
I am giving 1 rating because there is no option for zero rating. I booked sofa cleaning and pillow cleaning earlier the job was about 1 hr 20 Min but what we get after booking. 2 people came and finish his work in only 10 Min and collect the cash of rs. 1074 even without accepting my booking. after taking payment they cancell my order from UC app so i did not give rating to him. really pathetic service and customer support i have ever seen.
One service booked at Coimbatore getting postponed by 15days because of unavailable professionals. If the company has lack of professionals ..why commit to a service and get payment from the customer. Everyday I receive a call telling the service is getting rescheduled to so and so date and they close the issue.. awful experience..
Good and well maintained.
Outstanding service
I had booked for ac service but techician not assigned. So I cancelled it.. but didn't got refund. Paid through Paytm wallet. Same email id
The server is very glitchy please fix it . üò∂
we booked for. pest control The worst and the most un professional service.. extremely disappointed withe experience
Never take a service from Urban company They are cheaters. They will damage your appliances by sending local technicians. They damaged my AC which was of just 3 years old,I complained several times in their app but no one responded. It will only show our person will call in 15 minutes..but no one will call
after 1 year of getting set with a new barber at UC (which was my primary reason for signing up), and filling out a long survey and a call on my preference for a particular barber, and having the same barber for one year, I am now told: oh I sorry that Barber doesn't serve your area as it falls outside his coverage area, even though it's literally only a few kilometres away. What B.S.! And if you complain the say oh sorry its policy..well nice policy! you just lost yourself a long term customer.
Very useful app, especially when you are new in a place/city.
very nyc service
Very bad experience.the guys who came for ac service were untrained and created a total mess in my house.the ac wasnt checked post service as mentioned in the process.money gone waste
Big scam dis year
Quite good
Had a very bad experience with them.They charge cancellation charges if you cancel the service and also they charge cancellation charges even if the service is cancelled by their technician. No time commitment nowadays
Pathetic service and i have to remind to visit and do the needful. Scheduled for 3 pm reached 4 pm after call and raise a ticket.. package was for kitchen and bathroom but only kitchen service done. Won't book service again
Customer care service so poor, there is no direct number to reach them, after lodging a compliant never received a call back from urban clap
Good
Worst experience. Booked AC service, got slot for after 4 days, and on the day of service, no technician was assigned and was asked to reschedule, again for 4 days later! That too when I have taken a plus membership of the app! Highly unprofessional! Disgusting! Totally unacceptable from a company that markets itself as premium service delivery company!
very bad
Good company
Commitment of coming on time when I booked for air conditioner servicing is pathetic
When I was trying to book booking at Rs 399 due to app issue or technical issue , however now shoing price Rs599, pathetic
Worst services, i was given slot after 4 days & the engineer called me on 4th day at 9 pm which I missed, the whole day I have not received any call for assignment. After that he cancelled my service which was prepaid. When i called the engineer he was saying that he was 10 km away from my house at the time of call. Will never use urban clap services! Worst experience ever.
Poor service. Even after advance full payment, no service received and amount deducted
Labor charges and charges for checkup together is a whole lot to ask for apart from service/rate card. We cannot afford such
Just feel lucky if the professional comes on time and doesn't ask you to reschedule.I suffered for almost 3-4days just to get one work done. Once the professional just came and casually said that they haven't brought the required equipment and asked us to reschedule. Also only some professional arrive on time (only some). And I can't understand why they doesn't have a customer care phone number. Never going to consider Urban Company again,it wasted a lot of my time.
Great service provided
very poor quality of work for bathroom cleaning. strains in the bath hub are there as before. wall and floors not cleaned properly. glass shelf was broken. Revisit Booked twice by UC but professional refused to come says he busy with other projects. 24/March/2022:Booked a message for 8:00pm which was cancelled saying assigned professional is very far off, hence agreed booking was cancelled by UC. Hence it was only free time. Booked for 8:30pm. no one was assigned and no response from support
I booked n cancelled 3 times in the past as professional did not turn up and made it a big nuisance for us as we scheduled this in our busy work schedule, even after repeatedly telling that we don't want the professional to call us after business hours , even today i got a call from the professional assigned for tomorrow asking if he can come earlier, totally unprofessional , what's the point of booking slots then , not happy with the way things are being handled
I am not satisfied with my ac service please do not install this application
nice service
If you want to waste your money!! Perfect for you guys... They have a team of such unprofessional. They waste your time and money, and when you try to explain on the call to the customer care center, they never resolve the issue.. So please think before booking!
very nice service
Good
I didn't get my refund ,I have requested many times for my refund it still didn't reflected in my account.Always have the same excuse this is not the way you treat you customer.Now it's not about money you guys didn't have little concern about your customer.
Very bad it isnt working it is showing something went wrong please retry
Good service
Not able to book the service .
I requested for service only. Excellent job.... I strongle recomending it
nice
I booked for deep clean service of my split AC, for which they have indicated in their Application as Foam cleaning for the indoor unit and power jet cleaning for the outdoor unit, both of which are intense cleaning services. They charged Rs. 648/- and I paid immediately. I had booked the slot for 4 pm but nobody turned up till 6.30 pm. When I contacted the AC mechanic concerned, he said he is busy somewhere and will reach my place by 7pm. I doubtely asked him how can he service the ou
very good üëç üëè üëå
good service in Bangalore, but lack of resources in Mysore. Booking of two separate tasks could not be assigned to a professional after the booking was confirmed
Total Scam on AC Serice. The AC service technician will remove all the gas from the compressor and tell you that there is no gas. This happened twice to me within the span of few months.
last year I took your plan and paid ‚Çπ 299/-. UC completely failed to give any service I wanted. I'm feeling cheated here otherwise I feel they are successful in making these techies accountable for the services, so just keep it up.
No phone call for problems
Needs improvement
One of the worst experiences I have had in the recent times. Booked an AC service more than a week in advance and at the booked time no one showed up. After repeated tickets, no call from the help center. NOT AT ALL RELIABLE!
Excellent service very dependable professionals
Does not download beyond 62%.
I am unable to make a booking
Excellent company
Very bad service . And if you have an issue you not easy contact the customer service
Very much improvement of service, highly satisfied.
not bad could be better
so good
good service
good üëç
Worst service , really fed-up with this app not at all having responsible waste of time nd money
I got four ACs serviced and immediately the next day, one AC started to give trouble. It's been six days and i have raised this issue multiple times and despite having booked a visit, no one came. Probably because UC is not getting money for a follow up visit..i wanted to revise my premature 5 star rating to them, and they would not let me do that also.
Due to shifting of house, i have booked for AC unstalling and installing. The professional came and did that in the month of Dec 2021. He took my left over copper pipe of around 12ft long saying that is of no use which came along with my ac. And then we never have used our Ac because it was winter. Today when we were getting our servicing done then we got to know our Ac's entire connection was done wongly and due to that the ac is been damaged. No solution is been provided by UC.
OTP is taking in reverse order when I typed. Not once, happened at least 5 to 6 times today. After some time a message displayed saying that OTP generation crossed the daily limit. Poor app.
costly
Best
Too excellent .
Easy to avail service.
Urban clap was unable to assign any professional & insisted on rescheduling the appointment. Even after rescheduling on 2 day they did not assign any professional and asked to reschedule again..I had to finally cancel the booking and raised the request for refund. They did not provide any reference I'd through which I could follow up on this query.. customer care told me to call after 7 days if refund is not processed and you can raise new query if refund not processed but did not provide ref Id
nice
nice
Overpriced. They are charging just double sometimes even more for any work from market price.
Don't buy subscription of uc. They have no professional with them. After subscription u can't book service. Customer service is not good. Unable to reach customer care.
Excellent work done for dismantling TV cabinet, bed etc. The staff sent by urban company were highly knowledgeable and cooperative.. keep it up üëçüëç
Pathetic service and technician gives false commitments all the time
Worst services totally
Excellent service
Theif
Urban is the best sevice the provided thanks uc and uc partner
It was great experience probably I'll book with them constantly
good service, professional technician good, worth for money
excellent company
Very pathetic service they are not assigned a professional on time.They are not caring about your time and money and please don't take their annual membership as u don't get any better service as they claimed
Fake site Two times booked and amount collected. But service not done
Because of the damage done by the previous professional..now I am facing the issues..i asked for the general cleaning..now they are finding out the issues done by the previous professional..I complained to urban company and I have not received any kind of response
excellent work
Says you are professional but no promosing response to resolve the issue. Laps in communication to downward technicians and results in lapz in work and dissatisfaction by customer. I strongly recommend not to go for urban company for ac repair. They are incompetent
They have stopped there Deal of the Day service...That was the highlight of the app
Ontime-job done-good attitute-gentle speak-Professional work done of 500 Lts tank installation.Very Fast and satisfying so far.
Pathetic....fleecing people in the name of providing services. Behaving like true indian middleman.
Earlier i have rated it as 5 star. But they are not professional anymore. I have waited a professional for 2 days but he has not arrived. Customer care is now pathetic. Now UC stands for unprofessional company.
Good
Very satisfactory. Thanks for the service provided. Extremely happy with the cleaning work, will definitely recommend to others.
Nice
They were good earlier. But now their system has got rotten . Believe me they are cheating customers nowadays. God bless them.
Terrible experience with proffessional in covid timea theirbproffesional used same brushes for foot and hands and their proffesionals are rude she put cuts on my eyebrows and not given proper service their customer complaints handling is too bad they dont listen to customer grivences plz donT use urban clap
so nice services.
Utterly fraudulent company! The refund of 499 became 99 in no time!! Cancelled the existing booking and increased the price of AC service. On top of it their customer care executives give you missed call - disconnect after one ring- and you will have to chase them repeatedly! Number one fraud company
Very bad service
excellent
Most distressing and disgusting experience. Called for servicing of all my AC's. I was overcharged. Asked to make payment which was more than what came in the invoice. I was told by professional one of my AC's was not functioning,so changed condenser. The ac did not function. Made a loud noise. They told me that motor was not functioning. When I had shut my ac prev.season it was in working order. My motor was removed & taken away on the 9th of March. Today is 24th. No response. I'm in a fix.
Worst service
Good
don't have customer care number. cannot contact with customer care for any service related issue. I bought full ro service package. they don't show any link to book for fault/repair in warranty period. and they don't show slots and don't call back. I booked another ro service from this aap and paid again. technician are good but this urban company is a disappointment.
good
Their services has fallen down and how. They are not what they strated as. Really pathetic to see a great company go down like this.
It's totally cheter company. It's book my booking and told on service time it's not possible service as per your requirement. His one of executive name rahul singh told me cancel your request and book again, when I m going to book again it's demanding more money to me and schedule after 4 5 days and more expensive then earlier . It's totally fruad company and no value of customer and customer time.
No notification for ac repairing slot ire been days if they are not free then why are they giving any option for slot
Pathetic Service and customer support.
ok
Their experts are expert in making fool of customers. They show you 0 gas in your ac and ask offline charge for the gas. in this case customer thinks company charging ‚Çπ2200 then expert can negotiate some amount... but end of the time you pay for the gas which was already there in your AC. bad experience with me. both of my AC serviced well but huge amount for gas.
good
I've booked and paid but no service person assigned. It's way past my booking slot. Neither i received any call from customer support even after putting in multiple requests
Very bad experienceüëéüèªüëéüèª
My first experience. Very impressive and efficient. Mr. Mahesh Yadav is an expert. Special thanks to him.
App is good. You can get all the services here.
They dont have customer care which is a pain area. And company itself dont respond on query raised with them, within turn around time set up by them. PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE
a very dependable organization. meets the times lines perfectly. one can sit back and relax, when UC attends your job.
Not good customer support service
Can't book any service, always say " professionals unavailable " , need to book in advance after 5 days which only accepts online payment. Pathetic app and unreliable.
Super AC Service
good
Thanks you urban company
App is not opening
Don't ever go for painting work with urban company your hard earned money will be looted They don't hire professionals but hiring local Gundas to do the jobs and close the project without even completing it.in case, if we wish to cancel the project in half way due to nasty work done by so called professionals we won't get back the money we paid both are fraud professional and urban companyThere is no direct contact nos to speak with urban PPL and as to request call back but they won't call back
For online ac servicing. this is best application.
Pathetic service experience. Unprofessional approach and certainly not recommend anyone to get services from UC. Would better to get services from the Brand only. UC is not a company is a Call Centre I belive.
PATHETIC APP!!! No option to talk to customer care anywhere. Call back option in 15 mins doesn't work even after 15 hours. I feel Urban company is started to loot people... worst service ever
Not getting services time
Use less app they didn't assign service boy on time and after complaining they said you team contact you soon it now 30 minutes no one contact me never ever going to recommend this app to anyone at any cost for any services. They deduct money in advance and after that not provide services. Don't traped your self in theri ads they just are scam. Never goin to book any service again.
I am urban clap plus member but not able to login through my mobile number because I am not able to receive OTP msg. poor service.
I'm a first time user but m unable to get the slot and even after 1st time user the AC service cost is high rather than price which show me before the booking
I rescheduled it for the first time because your professional didn't arrive on time... No professional was appointed on the rescheduled time... No one calls for follow up or to fix the issue. What's going on guys? Too much business to handle? I am glad that I didn't waste my money on your subscription...
A very bad experience as am unable to book slots bcz professionals are not unable in Janakpuri area. Even after repeated calls nobody solved the problem and on top of it they insist on online payment more rather than availability of the slots for the customer
Horrible experience and no training given to technicians...
Will it also install? Stuck in 56%
From last 5 days no slots are available for bathroom cleaning...everytime says , that they will notify but never notify. Joke application
Highly not recommended The service booked was cancelled after the job becoz of fear of bad rating. The professional damaged my furniture and when complained to UC , the answer was " it's first time" highly unprofessional. Deleting the app. The customer care even deny taking responsibility . Zero star from my side. Never ever booking anything here again
massage therapist having best nature... nd she is too good in her work ... she is absolutely deserve 5 star... superb tooo good work ... Thank you so much
After servicing my AC not working properly.
Horrible service Appointment booked for 22nd Mar 2022 UC team rescheduled it for 23 Mar 2022 at 10 AM In the evening UC team calls to inform they could not adhere to the demand
This doesn't allow me to choose only full arm waxing without underarms. its so annoying to know that the company does even give a thought that most people these days get underarms laser and dont require the waxing.
Good app
Overall very good experience with UC, highly efficient customer service & host range of services available. No need to depend on local technician who may not respond you post service, however, with UC guarantee you can simply avail services with ease & peace of mind. Highly recommend
Good option to our home needs with reasonable price
Suman was really good at her job. Was very happy with the service she provided professional but sweet too.
excellent service
Urban company is good platefom for me .. But some reasone i give 1 star rating...
excellent service
This app changed the way i approach utility services forever. Excellent services provided.
Awesome AC Servicing
Useless application worst experience
good service,Nadeem Khan
Very much unprofessional approach. No value for customer time & money.
C grade customer care service.. You can't contact them. They will assigned you a time to call you and never made a call. Service partner refuses the services.
They are unethical, unprofessional you will get different quation for the same work also you will not getting call back timely.raised call back request in the it was showing 15min but I got call after 18 hrs. when I did escalation one of higher authority replied, me no one asked you to take our services and membership.
Pathetic experience, seems UC is hiring frauds in the name of professionals. They will make your appliances non working and then will charge extra to repair the same. No COVID protocol followed and finally no customer care to talk to.
good
Awesome
Worst over all experience. 1) booking (done 1 week ago)cancelled 1 hour after the scheduled time. 2) The resceduled professional shared the cost estimate as Rs 6950. But actual bill came as Rs 8750. 3) There is no call center number to call and complaint. 4) No revert call comes even after registering a complaint. Would not recomend to anyone.
There is no way you can get to the customer care. The app says they will call you in 15 mins but do not receive any callback. Do not book for an AC Deep Clean. Full of false promises. The technicians does not use foam even though it is part of the package. False promises.
Totally fraud company', after booking not attending the call and not provided any customer care contact number assistance, booked for assistance and not attending
Excellent
Excellent ..
awesome service
Most useless service providers....why don't u people do a precheck for availability of services in any area. Pathetic service .....don't fool people...
Pathetic Experience with AC service. Booking was done 5 days before the schedule time and no professional was assigned. Just got a call after 3 hours of schedule time for apologies.
Such pathetic service..I booked bathroom cleaning service and noone showed up...I tried contacting UC team and noone responded there as well....it appeared such a hole that there is noone I can approach and ask for what is the issue...I seriously request to close these services if you cannot manage things and stop fooling people
Worst company of the decade. 3rd grade company. Never use their services. They take the part of your tv & never return it & keep making personal excuses. Tired & sick of this company & their services. Third class company. Even after numerous complaints they couldn't help me in any way. Worst part is u can't call them. Please people whoever is reading this don't waste your time & money here. They are not worth it. U guys will never call & the tv part will never come. U have wasted my 10days.
Poor comitment making fool of user and wast the of coutomer
Very bad company U.C .
Worst service provider. They can't assign any professional. Wastage of time and money.
I've had a very horrible experience with the app. The urban company doesn't call at all. When I booked i paid the money and yet the professional was not assigned to me. Then my refund was not credited to my account and I have never received a single phonecall from the help department. They haven't published their valid phone numbers anywhere. This is not the service i expected. Update your app and your customer care service centers otherwise it'll be really difficult to run the company..
Good service
Worst service provided by urban company. Booked a technician for AC servicing. But nobody turned up at the assigned time 1.00 PM. At 3.30 PM received call from urban company that all technicians are busy and technician will visit at 8.30 PM and that is also not sure.
Nice
perfect work
You have taken money from me but no one came for service its been 3 days if you dont have manforce why are you fooling the customer, please do not give your electronic appliances in their hand my machine is damaged and they do not even call back they will take your hardearned money and run,, urban company nhee chor company ha
Booking is confirmed but technician is not assigned just they are rescheduling again and again
Superb Work With well skilled professionals
Technician cancelled the appointment as unable to reach on scheduled time and then UC was unable to provide me slot after 1 day, rather after complete week for AC service in this scorching heat, have uninstalled the app as UC is good for nothing
Professional and Good Service from all urban engineers
very good service
very good
Guys dnt go for kitchen cleaning very bad experience guy is not interested in clearing fridge chimney inside drawer or taking out stuff even after paying for complete package Rs 1999 So dnt waste your money and time no customer care number misleading info abt packages
Excellent üëç
The service was good
This is 3rd class service app
Its good
Friends Please don't use this app, No proper service. Technician is not coming within a day or so.
very good system
Wonderful experience provides best services
It is a useless company, they gave time for two-three days to do my AC service, but still did not service it.
Horrible. UC service provider kept canceling the appointment for AC service. UC exexutive cancelled the booking on his own. Deducted the cancelation charges for the money paid in advance. Refund to be received in 5-7 days. But, For new service, I have to pay same amount (approx Rs 2500/-) upfront once again.
Sudarshan did a very good service thank you
Best Service

Zindagi aasan ho gayi !

Waste management by this UC. they don't know what to accept what not to
Good service
Very much satisfied with the service person. He has done a tremendous work. Happy customerüòä‚ò∫Ô∏è
good
Totally satisfied.Technician arrived with a helper on the dot.Was wearing URBAN T-Shirt,mask.Was very knowledgeable,efficient,courteous.I will highly recommend URBAN COMPANY to all.VFM (Value for money)PAISA VASOOL!!The only downside is they levy a "convenience fee" which leaves a bad taste in the mouth.I suggest the company stops this fee.
I was charged a cancellation fee on my next booking while the cancellation was done from UC End.
No executive turn up over phone. 3 hours late arrival of ac service person was not handled by any executive.
I have book request for ac service but till now no body assigned and not able to connect customer care
Don't provide services in my area
Good service
There is no option to contact ur an clap help center , not even chat option . Very difficult
Worst experience on Urban Company. Not Able to assign professional in 3 days. Just spending on advertisment not on services. Please choose local person instead of urban company. They are making us fool through advertisment.
Worst experience ever they take 6 days for service and after time of six day no body contact they asking for more time please don't install urban company waist of time and money
This service is unavailable to my area @ chengicherla 500092
satisfied with the job done
Easy to book appointments.but costly
Good service and quick results
Good
U can call Urban com for good servicing if u need.
Worst application ever
Nice App And Service
Unable to book service after subscribing plus service. Also unable to pay. Please respect your customersüôè
Very good satisfied with my service
Worst service ever.. book first time will ever ever book again.. Big No to others who want to take this service.. person didn't turn up on time even after calling so many time.. not clear the way shown in the app. not check gas or cleaning by spray as mentioned...
My slot has been cancelled and given to other. Rescheduled after one week. This is unfair. No one will trust in future.
Thanks a lot, highly impressed
I have booked visit for Washing Machine drain cleaning services after Free video consultation But Technician not solve my problem and suggest me to replace pump and it's cost around approx Rs 3500 but pump is workin perfectly only issue is some material stuck inside the machine which was removed after open the washing machine but Technician says it's not cleanable it's only replace. however I paid Rs 349 for visited charge to technician So it's not good I am very dissatisfied with UC service.
hard to reach customer support and there professional has not completed there work and went out . when we call they will ignore
Pathetic experience.. Someone should have visited my house for AC Service but no one came neither called..Not getting any response from the APP..I suggest get your AC serviced from local vendors rather than watng
Worst experience from Urban clap, ordered a service for AC installation on Jan 03,22 but it wasnt installed properly and later there was Gas leak and water leak from AC unit, after revisit on Mar 12,22 it wasnt resolved then also.Hence booked again for Mar 22,22 and no one showed up & no calls were being answered. Now i have to pay to get it repaired for their sheer negligence. Asides these people donot have any customer care either and their team dont even know their warranty claim period too.
for AC servicing it is not informed to us that 2 person will do the task . in case this is something new plan then customers should be communicated in advance. we didn't know about this. such transparency should be there for better service.
Very pathetic service. Customer support is just for namesake.I booked AC repair service but even even after 2 times reschedule technician is not assigned.After waiting of long hours support member is replied as there is some technical issue and will assign the technician manually... next day also same story is repeated. They are not able to assign a technican even after 2days. Support team have zero knowledge they don't even know how to esclate or report to the next level.
Thanks good professional work with fully equipped
Urban Company I have raised a complaint on the app regarding my recent booking of March 10th for AC cleaning. Post the AC cleaning, the AC did not start for quite some time and later once the AC is turned on, it stopped cooling. The Professional that has come has taken the PCBs for repair and now it's been a day less to two weeks and the professional is not responding to my calls, I have raised an complaint on the app and no one called back till now.
Not so punctual , rest satisfactory work
Fraud company
Very bad
Customer Support is Pathetic. Please Don't Waste Your Time & Money Here. I have made a booking a Week ago but None of their Professionals arrived. Moreover, Customer Support will not help you at all. So, it's better to call Your Local Service Provider. Seriously Disgusting Experience From Urban Company.
Pls consider starting your services in Muzaffarpur, Bihar as well.
Your technicians were came with very short cables, it was very insufficient, so upon request i have given my bajaj wire extension, after used by them it is not working, You technicians show me gas quantities, leakages, it very good, but after feeling gas they are not showing gas quantities level and repaired leakages me personally, how i confirmed that it is properly repaired and gas feeling sufficient. Also outdoor unit cleaning done very well, but indoor unit cleaning completed just within
vry nice
The video consultation service is really awesome.
Good service
very friendly technicians and good work and come with equipped toolset
Good AC service
Very bad that when customer wants to talk to your end u give time of 15 min not able to call back also. I was a sechulded appointment it was cancelled at your point if she had told us yesterday we can do alternate she called in the morning and asked us to cancel the appointment is this the way to deal with customer . This is very bad
I have opted for a bathroom cleaning n our bath room wc n wash basin got cracks this not the first time last time when opted for bath room cleaning wc got cracked but that time i recognized after one month bcoz it was in lower side of wc but this time i can recognise cracks only after three days n it is out of damage period bcoz all fitting are white n we can't recognise cracks i don't know which chemical they use pls think twice before give service to uc cleaning
Pathetic Service!!, First, the assigned professional called and denied at the last minute to visit, but I got msg that the professional was not able to reach me despite several attempts and reschedules the time. After waiting for an hour for customer care to call me back, I got assurance that the professional will visit the next day but what I see is the technician was not been assigned after the reschedule!! How unprofessional it is that you gave assurance but don't take responsibility. I wasted two days trusting your false assurances and still no luck to get my issue sorted. It was the first time I used Uban calp and had this worst experience the org and the customer care is quite unprofessional. First experience is last experience as they say, I am not gonna use Urban clap ever!!!
excellent
Customer support wont respond wrost experience.
worst service , my slot was at 8 am but the professional was not assigned even after 8:30 so finally cancelled my booking and also raised ticket on app (saying will recieve call in 15 min) , but didnt recieve any call for 45 min
Technician has not serviced as per uc norms
Vary good aap
Worst experience from urban company I was booked a AC service but nobody was assigned for the same. They wast my time.
Form last two year m trying to book service form uc bt still u r unable to provide service in south west delhi...
Very good. I mostly use this for all my household needs too.
It is not same as earlier experience.
They are charging at high prices by adding extra charges.
Worst costumer sappport ...after my booking for kitchen cleaning they made me empty the whole kitchn b4 the guys comes {althought it was his job} after that he never showed up and all i was told " sorry for inconvinence" for 2 days slots are full i had to do all hard work to set my kitchen all over agian no one even called even after my reapted callback req. They are phethtic dont trust them im uninsttalling
Very poor app.... No option to contact customer care to claim UC warranty.... Each time i click to claim UC warranty for a recent service, it says : "Please check your network" At least there should be a customer care no or email in order to address the grievances....
Purchased a water purifier from Urban company. Delivery guy outrightly refused to deliver it to flat. No way to connect with customer support but only messaging them on application. No response or call from them even when they promised to call in 15 minutes. Terrible experience with delivery and customer care, so returned the water purifier. Now looking forward them to collect it from my flat. They may be good in other cases but this time their response, customer care, delivery was abysmal!
Good
Assam press NUHMA
I m really disappointed from your service if you guys are unable to doing yours job on time then why is making fool to person who is depending you also no one is responsible from your side ..very worst experience with urban company
This is the worst app. Their conduct is very unprofessional. I booked my ACs service from the app and my slot was scheduled after four days of my booking and the app took money in advance, but no body came and when I made the text request, I recieved the call after 4-5 hours and I requested them to arrange someone for servicing my ACs, the executive assured me that the ACs will be serviced tomorrow, but lateron they refunded me after making unreasonable deductions. Pathetic App of fraudsters.
Really this is best ap for servicing acüî•üî•ü•∞ü•∞ thanks urban company
Their customer service is the worst. They sent an ac technician for service who was already known to be corrupt( from previous reviews). He removed all the gas from a well functioning ac and gave his personal number for gas refill at half the price of urban company charges. I reported the issue to customer care a month ago. They didnot respond to the initial complaint. After multiple complaints they called back but till now not resolved the issue. They are cheating people.absolute cheating
work perfectly done
Don't go for plus membership, it's nothing but to make us fool because since last 7 days I have been trying to book for AC service but no slot z available. Is it not worthless?? Just now tried for washing machine repair even for that no slot available üòë 99100 63124. Still no response. Why do you charge convenience fees from customer who has already plus membership??
Good
Absolutely pethetic sevice. Its been 5 days I have booked an appointment for AC repair and nothing is happened.
My app is not working from last 6 days. I have even reinstalled the app. still no good. There is no help center what so ever for such struggle.
Very bad, they come do some repair and go, next day the sane issue, when called customer care they don't care much about our issues.
I'm an international user, trying to book services for my parents and inlaws in India. Your website is unresponsive, your app is not letting me enter the city. As a company you should look Into the accessibility of services from all over the world. I've booked couple of services before, but your websites functionality is very bad.
I booked a usual ac service but the professional refused to service my ac and in return I got charged for that service by urban company. Why am I being charged for a service which I didn't take. And there is no response from customer care. I have been trying and trying for the last 2 days but it doesn't seem that you team is looking into resolving customer pain. No response on raised tickets. I never thought I would be this disappointed by UC.
Never go with Urban company. Chasing them on a daily basis for the refund of 8.5k which they are supposed to make. Nobody responds either to logs raised in the app or calls made to customer care. Worst experience ever had
rate was little expensive
very bad experience by urban company after service ac is not working
service man was very hamble
very good service
couldn't contact customer care directly, assigning professional is not as per process..
Very poor. Not professional should closed in gujarat. No person was coming for AC service, no call from company . After 1 hours 30 minutes they denied and say no professional is arrange for service. Very bad experience. After 6 days of booking no service done. Very very bad
Worst experience
service was very costly
This is based on my first experience. I may give better rating once my experience gets better. I booked for AC servicing for 3 units two days ago for today. They did not allot service person even after allotted time. I gave a complaint and they informed that they would call back in 15 minutes but they did not call. I looked for rescheduling but only one slot at odd time was available. So, I cancelled my booking. I am from Guntur, Andhra Pradesh.
The technicians had very professional approach and were polite. Explained everything after detection of the problem.üëç
nice service
the professional never turn up for repair after service. executives will call once in morning and they don't care after that. u have to bear the trouble on your own
Worst worst worst experience, useless app, unprofessional staffs, they cancel their their bookings and tell dat we have cancelled the bookings, not recommendable, don't go for this app
Worst experience ever. I booked their service but the technician assigned did not make it and nothing is being done about it even though I have already filed an issue. Did not even receive the call back I was suppose to and urban company is going to charge me for cancellation of such. Ridiculous
Worst service, I booked for AC both spilt and window service person was average nothing think about how to clean
I using the membership of the urban clap 1 booked 3 ac cleaning in 1247rs but when i cancle the 1 of the 3 ac cleaning booking the refund 200rs according to my bill i pay 400 on per ac there is no customer service they make fool to us i suggest you dont book any thing with them they doing fraud by giving membership and all
Terrible experience. Very unprofessional service
Don't use urban company. Very bad experience i have faced due to technical problem from there side. And after 3 hours of westing my and technician time, they have cancelled my request. Then i looked for local technician, they did same services at half rate
Technician damaged my AC, keep on following up but no response from both technician and company customer care. Weekly once new person from customer care calls and say I'm very sorry for the inconvenience will arrange immediate visit by best technician but after that no response.. they call professionals but they all are useless guys. Please don't go for Urban company instead you search some local service personnel or do it yourself.
UC was great in the beginning but post pandemic,the service ppl are bad.they ask for advanced payments and then the service man comes and denies the work...and forget about the refund aswell.no contact number/help center number mentioned on the app.extremely disappointed
Technician not assigned
Booking raised but no one bother to call or support for the booking. Support mentioned to call within 15 minutes but no response. PATHETIC SERVICE!
cleaning materials too diluted and scrubbing machine does not clean corners and itvis also very heavy.... the boy who came worked very hard
One of the most worst experience among online apps I had used. I have been using urbanclap for a while. Everytime I book a carpenter or a electrician for a slot they always call me and say we cannot come and ask me to push to another time. I am a Urban clap plus member and this is what the service I get. Worst worst and worst
Company is charging extra amount after completing the services. While booking rate card shows different amount and after completion charges are totally different
Good service
Excellent services üëå
good service
Not trust worthy for AC repairs except cleaning. Technicians cheat in name of Gas Filling. They charge whooping 2500. Looks like a gambling game by UC and Technicians to loot money from customers. Technician arrived at my place told me that , gas filling is the issue without checking anything and offered me Gas filling for 1800 without going by UC job card. UC , now tell me how do you want me to trust you and ur technicians. I request users, better to contact respective AC service technician.
good
Worthful and perfect
great work
Pathetic service. I just changed my 5 star rating to one. Wish I could give zero. Beauticians cancel their appointment without prior notice without informing. And the company instead of allocating the job to another beautician reschedules it to another day without checking with customer. Why will I work according to the time you allot ? If you take a booking you have an obligation to follow through or probably I'm expecting a lot from a company that doesnt have ethics in place.
Very convenient, at home service!!
Incredible experience. Went out of the way to ensure the service was offered without fail
I think UC deleted or hid my review? Everyday the AC technician cancels. We keep waiting . Do not pay for their premium plans, waste of money if the tech never comes. You cannot call customer care. The technician cancels and the app reschedules automatically to another time when you may not be available. They don't call to say that the technician cannot make it. Your time is of very little value here. Twice this has happened already
Technician demanded to give 5*. They will not work if give <5 rating. Technician reached on time & deep cleaning done properly. However, while fixing the issue copper pipe got broken & demanded money to purchase new one. Later they adjusted the amount in service charge. They just left the house without cleaning the areas, where the deep cleaning done & the bedroom where AC installed. In less than a week water leaking issue started. When I called'em, "U gave <5, so will come on our free time.
Very very bad experience
Professional & excellent service very safe hygienic
Pthetic app. They promise to give priority service for UC members. Even though I have membership. They are not able to arrange single technician for washing machine repair. 4 times it was rescheduled due to unavailability of any technician. I would advice every one not to waste your money in buying membership of Urban Company.
Easy to use..... best service app
Only few professional are good at their job. Most of them use this platform only for contacts
Has to change my review after experiencing their bad attitude and uncooperative and unethical behaviour, first the professional assigned did not came at the assigned time not even 2 hrs after it,when called he told he has some medical emergency, then tried to raise an issue over the app. But they will notify you that they will call with in 15 min. But they will never call and cherry on the top soon you will receive a message that ur problem has been resolved with no convo with u at all PATHETIC
good
Exlent
No response or action after raising issue with the company, totally irresponsible behaviour
Wonderful AC servicing provided by Urban company
It's my sincere request to everyone. Plz don't take service from UC . They don't have any customer care. U would regret it. Plz wait until they start this customer care service. Many of the technicians are also less knowledgeable. They will fool you.
Very nice
thanks for excellent work
Very unprofessional, no value to the customer time. Poor service commitment, book the ac service at 4.30 22.03.2022, no response. Poor customer service. No contact number and no call back. Very pathetic service.
This is of no use now. Slots are not available. Anytimr check slots are not available why hell you guys took money for membership nad if you doesn't have enough trchnicians then please refund the membership charges. Pathetic
the time slots are not provided even when beauticians are free. company book self comfort timings and cost so high , be U is far better as they provide instant booking and service
Cheating app they advertise vig you save less than membership charges we will refund. But fake. Words they won't refund. Customer care number also they don't have
Don't buy subscription after buying subscription U can't get slot easily & after getting cancellation is common subscription is not refundable This is useless app advise to Google to remove app to protect customer
very nice service
No customer care number for any queries in hyderabad.
Nice Service dine by Raja and team
Zero after support service by this company.. you should shut down your business
Disgusting.They charged enormous amount for servicing the AC and even after complaining about the same nothing was done.
What is the use of having an app for poor customer service? Bye bye.
Worst customer service provider. 1st appointment got cancelled because UC was not able to assign a technician. 2nd appointment was also a complete disappointment. They accepted my booking on 19th March 2022 . The technician was to visit me at 2:30pm on 20th March 2022. Have waited the whole day. Nobody turn up. Pathetic pathetic service it is. I didn't get a any call from UC too. I wish there is an option for NEGATIVE rating
Everything is overpriced (for drilling one hole in a wall the plumber took 200rs and 5 holes he took 1000), plus the plumber did not fix everything properly. After two days the taps started leaking again. I had to call someone else to fix it . Customer executive was very good,they understood my problem and they have helped resolve my problem.
I have used urban company app mostly for salon services. I have been using it since 5 years and had a very good experience. If I had any concerns related to the professional they were handled on time and acted properly. Professionals follow all the rules stated in the app.I have used their other services as well like ac cleaning, sofa dey cleaning, plumbing, etc and in NCR & Mumbai both. They have never failed to meet my expectations. I highly recommend the app.
My experience was really good with uc service
Professional and expert service
Very Poor Services....by urban clap and it's professional...
Even after two years and change to Urban Company the services remains pathetic. I booked for a sevice in advance and the professional is still not assigned. You team will never be able to provide services. Good for nothing brand. I apologise for giving your team a second chance. This is the worst app I had ever used. Requested for AC service on 2nd Apr for which they deducted 49rs advance however have not yet provided any service after 2 reappointment request and have also not refunded 49rs.
Their cleaning service was not nice they didn't fulfill the specified cleaning requirements (deep cleaning)
Find real professionals for repairing and cleaning services at an economical price. Other than that the spa and massage services aren't that great and are pretty overpriced too considering the disappointingly trained professionals. The ratings on the app for massage and salon services are near 5 star but my experience has been otherwise. The service techs for repairing and cleaning are the best, specially if it's yr AC, refrigerator, house wiring, washing machine, MW etc.
Fraudsters
Even thy can't assign executive on time and even can't inform us..Poor customer service ...
They cancel your bookings at last minute and there is no way that you get any help from the company. These experiences are for bookings done well in advance
excellent service
Good Service by the professional Thanks to urban company
Good
good
Very very poor
good

Raja ram who is the Technician who addressed the issues...
Good
Its easy to access app ,but dont fall for things that are advertised. The level of sophistication shown in ads are totally opposite to the technicians sent . Not recommended for domestic service ,can be opted for restaurant or office.
Great Service by UC
Very professional service
Now I can't login me contact number errror show
Good
All services are increased with price
Nice app I like it good person are there in this
I m raiting 4.5 not 5 beacuse employees should get the safety harness, aprons,gloves and caps for safety reasons which protect them for any kinds of unexpected accidents. For their own good! I encountered yesterday while they are cleaning our windows we are staying in hight floor, it could be risky. Regardless employees safety should be first. Rest everything is smooth and cool...really liked the services!!üëç Do recommend.
Very very disappointing . Came late 2 hours and said they were incapable of doing the work and asked me to cancel. I live abroad and on a short visit to Kolkata, Urban properties caused immense distress to a senior couple
I am giving 1star because below this not available. They are fooling customers. I booked AC service, that time professional told me that some part damage and need to refill gas However my AC was new but I thought may be he is right and he completed all thing and provided me high amount bill. but now again for next service I am facing same issue. Everytime samething happened but I thought this time was not good, may be next time genuine Professionals will come.This app & service are pathetic.
Very bad because category manager Is wrong
I have been using urban company services past 2 years.. Reasonable prices, experienced technicians and excellent services.. Thank you team Urban company üëç
My latest experience of booking gone waste , professionals shown least interest in our projects.
I got my refund after damage to my previous AC. what more do you want?
They are cheating public dont trust this app they are well trained for bad service they use their own spare parts it have high price they not even reply for that plz dont use it
After multiple times rescheduled my AC service yet no professional has been assigned once. Not expected so bad service from UC. My time wasted in waiting for professional get assign now finally canceled my booking and removing app from mobile. No compensation No customer support.
Service person not assigned. Plus when I raised concern , it showed that somebody will call me and hel sort it out , and no one called. So, basically service is bad & customer care is worse. Which makes this application a worst one.
v.good
You don't provide services in our location Pin: 501 401 Hyderabad
Worst Experience in Cleaning
Charged hefty amount for repair. Appliance stopped working after 1 week of repair. And the company has now ghosted me. üòÇ Excellent business tactics. Fraud.
worst service by urban company
Very bad experience, unprofessional behavior, very rude professional. Instead of providing services after 4 days of scheduling company initiated refunds without contacting.
my last appointment was cancelled and it was quite an inconvenient
One of the most disgusting experiences in recent past with AC servicing. An experience to remember for long
These guys are not up to the mark, erronously paid yearly subscription, first job ordered and they cancelled... Not a very promising situation.
booking and cancelled address was not shown properly which created cancellation even after change of address
excellent work
No professional assigned even 2 hours after the booked slot, the customer support doesn't call. It just says will csll soon
Overall satisfied the service
nice
Not happy with UC. Neither technician calls neither UC service support attain our calls dispite having priority membership
No professionalism at all, the staff just knows to talk well,no professionalism in the work..i had to take the vaccum cleaner from him to show him how to clean the corners of the house/ how to remove stains from the borders of the tiles..waste of money only some staffs are good at their work not all.. others are just for sake of name..real sevice is very different than shown in ads.
No slots are available. Click on 'notify me when slots are available'. After some time you receive a notification that slots are available, book now. You get excited and fill in the complete details again and click on book slot. Guess what?? Slots are still not available and you can again click on 'notify me when slots are available.' This is an endless loop of this dumb application. Hopeless!!
Good
Untrained proffesionals, impolite partner support team. Repair at your own risk, fake promises. Technician damaged my product and then ran away with false promise of coming back with broken part. Later on received a call from partner support to cancel booking and do a new booking so that they can hide any trace of damage by the technician. Please, repleace Or fix my product. We have elderly people living at home and without water purifier they are at risk and you are responsible
Very poor service Booking kar k paise leke bol te hai slot Khali nahi hai Third class service
Very good service üëçüëç
Worst experience ever! Ordered a cleaning service, and the professional caused damage to the property for which I wasn't compensated.
good work
Urban company not good now so many problems this app....üëéüëéüëé
Superb service, Very professionally they have cleaned outdoor and indoor unit of AC. Authorised technicians also well disciplined. Thanks Urban Clap...
After paying they automatically cancel by themselves, but app shows service man is on the way, if you try to cancel, then they charge you 400INR, & then they don't give you refund.... pathetic
Excellent service
Warranty that you provide is totally fake. I am Trying to claim warranty for RO and no responce in call or email for 1 week. If you cannot fullfill warranty then dont advertise it.
I have done booking last week for ac servicing bt still professional not assigned very worst service
Dhokebaj app yah aap apne aap ko Khud rating maintain karta hai Ek star itne customeron Ne de rakha hai Fir Bhi iski rating acchi hai bahut Road Company hai yah
When I booked a plumber, after saying that he would come within 30 mins and got the code from me - he cancelled the job. The customer service representative contacted me was even more pathatic and rude. He says he doesn't believe my experience to be true as the plumber mentioned - "customer cancel the service" while cancelling the job. Pathatic Experience. Pathatic customer service executive.
Quite effective. Kudos for service
How can you not have a single way to contact the company? It's just a bunch of FAQs. No chat. No phone number. Just some email id that is only mentioned on the website and not even on the app
Worst service ever urban company not repair the thing they just destroy it... My washing machine is not working after repairing that by your electricians...My machine is not cleaning 1 small cloth also...üò°üò°üò°üò°
good üëç
Best
Had scheduled an appointment, not able to contact either the call centre or the beautician assigned for service. This has happened for the 2nd time now. Pathetic experience, they dont care about anyone else's schedule.
Nice service ....
The app is not working.. Where to make the booking
very good
No service
Changing the rating to 1 star for the company's pathetic customer service even after being a PRO member. The technician who came for work added multiple extra charges where there shouldn't be any extra charges. When enquired upon it, the customer executive had no clue what the charges are about. He said he needs more time understanding the issue and cut the call and marked the issue resolved! Raised issue again on their app, and followed up multiple times, yet no one bothers to give call back.
It's fake company, ask you to take annual subscription and for normal repair work like refrigerator and tv takes 5-6 days to book your slot. And alos cancel your booking at the last minute with excuse that engineer not available. Seriously for refrigerator repair can you wait 5-6 days.. so I wouldn't recommend to take services from Urban Company at all
No one attending the co.paint they just got worsted.
Service professional not coming on time even same appointment day and no revert also not good
There is high charged for small appliances, for each service separate charge, when we combined they should reduce the price, few people's are not professional and giving proper information and service is very bad.
service done was excellent.
should include more variations under facial services... use of organic products/ayurvedic treatments
Very very bad experience. They just canceled the booking by saying that technical team nor available. If team not available then why you people gave the slot. It's just cheating and fooling customer.
Ok
Dont want to give any star but I got afraid after reading reviews ....
Worst app ..waste of time.. very costly a/c service slots are not available
Worst experience. After confirmed booking also they failed to send expert multiple times. Time waste process. We can't trust our sevice will be done as per schedule since they doesn't have sufficient professionals as per requirement.
Quality of cosmetic products used is really poor... I tried CRAVE clean up... I felt burning sensation on my skin... Real bad experience
Have been trying to book for an AC service since 2 weeks now, their app always says no professional available. Guess it's time to look for an alternative. Pathetic experience.
3rd class service
Very unprofessional services and very unprofessional customer care. Speaking this after multiple experiences with them. In a recent experience, I booked a massage service and paid 1,310 for that along with buying a premium membership. No one showed up at the scheduled time, neither any contact details of the professional was shared and when I raised it to the customer through the app, there wasn't even any response. (Sorry out of character limits, otherwise would have shared complete instance)
There was a small issue in my double door refrigerator where ice was not forming in top section. UrbanCompany suggested me to refill the gas to resolve the issue. I paid Rs. 2200/ for this service but after a day my fridge stopped working. Both the panel were not cooling and started spoiling food items and milk. I connecte back to UC and technician but no one is ready to resolve it. In simple they made my fridge in dead condition and stopped supporting me. Now its 17 days (21 March 2022).
pathetic service and customer care... even after asking them to call, noone called... its been 2 dats and my service is still not done and they have marked the service as started even though noone has visited the site today... horrible experience... regretting my decision to go with UC..
üëåüëå
Third class service. No specialist available for mens royale salon package. They don't have resources for serving suburb location like malad west..since 24 hrs now..pathetic
Horrible experience... They have taken my money and failed to deliver... Customer service is also not rechargeable..
My Rating us still the same. Took annual membership and because I already paid the membership fee their swrvice is deteriorated. Had cancel all the bookings as the assigned technicians do not come as per the time booked. they come as per their wish. Do not waste money and especially your time waiting and thinking these people will fufill your service request. Try other alternatives. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS YOU WON'T RECEIVE ANY CALL BACK. IF YOU TRY USING SOS, THEY WILL CALL YOU IN AN HOUR.
Very poor customer support. You pay them...they forget you..thats urban company.
Very bad and pathetic experience...... professional doesn't pick up the call and support team just has the same dialogue everytime. Waiting for a long time to fix my problem but no response at all. I request others to think twice before using this app.
perfect service
Worst customer service
DO NOT USE THEIR SERVICES.The worst app on the face of earth. These guys gave me a nasty rash and did not even have the courtesy to apologize or even did not pay me my own money back after promising they would. I keep on reaching them and they do not reply to any of my concerns
After. Booking professional not assign till time
Had opted for UC for simple window a.c servicing. The first technician damaged my ac while his visit. Did not even acknowledge, it . On revisiting the other technician damaged the compressor while checking. Despite repeatedly trying to contact the company, the company has still not contacted back. Completely fake service. Taking the matter to consumer forum.
. .
Pathetic kitchen exterior cleaning. The scrub used by the UC person was already worn off. He told the paint stains cannot be cleaned on tiles and when he was gone i cleaned all those paint stains with heavy duty scrubber myself. Waste of money and time. He couldn't even clean grease stains on the edges of kitchen slab and floor. He just came to do timepass with worn off scrub and one spray. He didn't even touch the tap and kitchen sink.
Fooling people getting message Again n again " service 100 - coupon has exceeded its maximum redemption limit "
good
Mr Vijay was assigned to me. He called me in the afternoon. I have clearly explained him the work of installing the air cooler. He came now and he is saying I will not do the work of installation. I am highly dissatisfied by this kind of service and i will carry forward this message to every other customer and ask them to stop using urban clap sevives. This is an utter disgrace.
I have the worst experience with them today.. unprofessional with rude behaviour.
Useless application.
Had a very bad experience with my first ordered service. I couldn't even reach out to the customer support. No way to call them, callback in 15 mins never came.

I had very bad experience with UC. My washing machine service was booked 8days back but still it is not done by the mechanic. Neither UC nor the mechanic are responding to my call. It is better to avoid UC for any kind of service. Pathetic service
Didn't receive my refund till now and they even don't call after sending complaint shameless service
Very stupid services and services not happening on the given slot schedule time
UI is user friendly and so many offers and other things make it pocket friendly and great services
Very worst service
good
Time punctuality is Missing... And also we can't reach to customer care executive. Pathetic Service provider App. Get well soon UC. What is your Customer care Number ??? Sorry but i can't see any contact details in your mobile app.
I am AC service booking today 5:30 p.m. not call engineer not call urban company third class service poor rating poor poor poor 000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 I am not service urbanclap not recommended
Pathetic service don't book anything.
Excellent and Marvelous work.
Very pathetic service. Its been 4 days, they are unable to service my washing machine. Upon re-booking, the other professional denied to service without having the rejected items from the previous one. The first one took those and now I can't contact him. UC, your coordination is very poor. It sends PROFESSIONALS who take away your items.
Worst engineers. Quoted 8k for AC installation. And demanded cash only. When mentioned i made prepaid booking he asked me to cancel the order and pay in cash. Ridiculous. I cancelled the order and said NO to the engineer as well. I will Never entertain unprofessional behaviour.
Always Not available positions in metro city
Professionals don't turn up on time. No call centre to call. Worst servicd.
No response or assistance provide from customer support,in the end I have to cancel the booking and now waiting for refund. never try this in future, very bad experience with UC !
Waste of time...no prior intimation for booking cancellation. I had to reschedule the booking twice and still couldn't get the technician...
Was happy with the service as well the professional team. I serviced 2 split ac with urban co, and their team made the service very cool and im proper manner.
nice app and very useful services are listed
Wrost application waste of money
Didn't clean the ladder which they used.
Very disappointed with the service level in the first call itself. I booked a AC repair call on Saturday and the service call was booked for 3 pm today. Later got a message that the service engineer will visit at 4 pm. But no one has come. The service engineer has been assigned but he is not taking calls from me. What a poor experience in the first call itself. Waster my money on taking the subscription. When I am trying to call help line I am getting recorded message that due to high traffic you are not able to take calls and you have sent an sms giving alternate no to call. But no such SMS has been received.
Excellent
rates are high and does not provide services for face wax in classic and economical..
I booked AC cleaning service on 20/Mar/22. The technician has proposed gas filling for ‚Çπ1000 by connecting and showing some meter. I refused and asked only cleaning. He did satisfactory cleaning job. But I am not sure what has changed, my AC unit stopped cooling. Now It just works like a fan. I tried all modes in remote control, but nothing worked. I regret my decision I paid for this cleaning and spoiled my working AC.
Very poor service. Keep on canceling the booking at last moment.
Most perthitic and irresponsible service. Only think they can do is give lame excuses, Booked the AC servicing one week in advance so that i can manage my precious time ( in between my office meeting during WFH) and they did not even assigned any executive, even after 2 hours of job start (which they claim will be assigned 1 Hour before the service start) and They don't allow you to call them and they never call you back on time and when you get a call from them, they say "sir its peak time" Am I booking a service from some company doing professional business or some gully electrical store. why did you guys accepted my booking if you cant manage your operations. All they know is how to say sorry or we apologies.
excellent service
They take money and don't send professional.. I booked AC cleaning service.. they have not updated me with any details.. when I call customer care they informed my booking is cancelled n still I have not received the amount.
best service
awesome work,very neat and humble behavior,very friendly and professional in work
good work
Excellent !
Why convenience charge? It is not fair. If you want more money for the service, do it upfront, not when on payment page. It will definitely affect the word of mouth publicity. Though service by your staff was good I rated 3 star for this one reason. Expect a reply from you.
They have destroyed my product not once but thrice. These people do not respond to complains and emails.
vry good
Name should be FraudCompany instead of UrbanCompany. Even after denying service they are not refunding amount. This CheatCompany doesn't have customer care number also and you can't connect with them on call/at your disposal. !?PLEASE DO NOT TAKE ANY SERVICE FROM HERE!!
Iam Really fell very bad about they dont have any customer care center. I booked body massage nd the app shows me to get uc plus membership plans to save 10% discount for 6Months. After that i didnt get my Appointment. Since four days they didnt take my order. App shows professionals unavailable sorry we notify when we find. But still they didnt fix the appointment. I cant contact by them via any mails r customer support Also. Money suckers Dont believe this app. Nd dont pay online. Dont use any
Good service
For AC deinstallation and installation they charged more than 5000 and change giving the reason that gas has to be changed...when we found outside with other technicians they told us that it's not needed to refill the gas and the gas tube can be locked prior to deinstallation...the technicians working here are very unprofessional and money minded
Poor services and worst part is customer support, they promised call back in 15 min but received no call even after an hour. Assiging un professionals even if you are plus member. Never use it
Nice service & technician.customer remain Tension free
Extreemly poor service
Excellent service.
Good services
I am not happy with urban team , there team get highi charges after visiting , already if you paid visiting charges , executive force to pay after work more cash , very dangerous , and bill also not clear Guys don't use below services You can find local workers at near home area
Rupees 50 charged as an extra which was very wrong
Whatever the work, always depend on UC! The professionals hired are polite and work efficiently without making any mess ‚ù§Ô∏è
Excellent services
Go o o o d d d d
Poor class Service
very costly. simple single drilling nailing costs 150 rupees with them ... painting i got done from them. they did bad work.
Fraud company. My AC was working properly but after they visited for AC service it stopped cooling. They try to charge hefty amount ( not the one that showed in the app initially) after they come to your home. And if you don't pay they'll do this.
had a very good experience. courteous technician and professional delivery of service
Payment method improper and not shows improper prices. After completion of service we have to pay extra money. Even though we had taken prepaid services.
Very good service.
good work
Professionals come from far from my locality . This sometimes make delay in service and non availability of professionals. Otherwise service experience is good all the time.
After giving appointment for second time, you guys are still not finding professional.. This is really pathetic and worst experience i have with you. Much disappointed. I would have given you minus rating if permitted.
Nothing is available on this so it's better choose some other options
Super experience I have been never seen By Shankar Jilla
First time servicing on Urban company and it's really good experience.üëåüëç
useful application
Very friendly app, bathroom cleaning done to entire satisfaction but two different team called by me did the work in two different procedure, but happy with the result. Ordered for plumber service he didn't completed the job vanished.
Very poor service about my AC
Not getting booking AC service slots despite being UC plus member
Really an awesome app. I already did a service for my television which was really good. Now dosen't face any issues in the television. Today I fixed an appointment for the washing machine. Though there is no fault in the machine but still the technician explained the function of the machine properly & politely. Whatever the problem is Urban Company is the best to fix it. Just go for it.
This app doesn't provide contact number, email I.d. for registering complaint regarding deficiency in service and other things. In absence of this the app has become faceless and customer is helpless.
Adding extra charges,
super
Very pathetic app/service high in charge low in service
Installed the app. Read the reviews. Didn't make any service request out of fear. Uninstalled the app.
Great opportunity
The perfect service available at your doorstep in the comforts of your home..Very happy with the service.Thank you
I was the first time user in uc i have got good experience with nurul huda person
Customer service & management is pathetic and really unempathetic. Don't know what took them more than a fare amount of time to resolve and credit for one session worth of points. (now close to 1.5 month) Due to a design flaw of the app, which doesn't show the due date to book our session for which we have already paid. Also if you have been paid in advance for future bookings than what makes you decide on due date which doesn't even appear clearly in the UC app. Free money n no service ??
This is the first time I tried Urban Company for getting my AC serviced.Must say,am more than satisfied infact impressed with the service and professionalism.Keep it up Urban Company!!
Ac serice is done as per my satisfaction with proper tools. Will recommend
nice service
good
Booking to hoti nhi hai kisi cheez ki jbb jrurat ho
Work done well n perfectly job undertaken.
good service
pathetic service
Bad service pathetic escalation manager Aanchal and professional Haneef...not at all booked the service pathetic service issue arised because of earlier service from urban clap and now saying we don't know the problem opt for one more service pay the cost...who will bear the cost cause of them if we are getting now saying that no longer haneef is available..book and pay for the service....if next time someone will charge more cause of your created issue..only you need money with this that's all
Bathroom cleaning service was perfect and recommend it for anyone wants to try.
No professionals available from last 1 day for ac services
Nice
Do not use this app. They will overcharge you and the professionals ask money even though I paid them through app. Worst experience ever.
I have not been able to book any service for a long now and the reason is that it does not allow me to make a payment.. it keeps saying "something went wrong, please try again"
Ac wet service did well,technician are well trained for service purpose only not for repair.
Pathetic after sale service and so called warranty. V can never reach them. Only automated robot messages and replies
It is just an disgusting app.Here the amount should get credited from the student but here it is debited from our account without informing.
Salon services prices have been increased so much now. It's better to get it done directly from salon shop or move to other apps offering salon from home. Was shocked to see double prices this time. Will never book from UC again.
I booked appointment for monday 9 am .i paid 199 thats ok .but what a support not a single message or call from them till now
Very Good Servicing
A very good initiative by this company. The executives wear official clothes all time and this app provides services which are essential for our daily life. It also provides various machines which make the work more efficient.
no customer care number
comemdeble job
Nice
over priced
Worst service
Worst services provided by UC. Executives are not all experienced and wasting time to analyse issues. Executive was damaged inverter and saying I'm not responsible, it's really not all safe and executives are not all professionals. Just bluffing people with fake reviews. Please be aware of this UC professionals.
Bought subscription and spa..no one arrived for service .when requested for refund the customer care tells me as per the policy the subscription cannot be cancelled . Now I am stucked with subscription for service which is not even offered on time
Excellent service
Very High pricing
Very prompt and user friendly . Available slots in my convinient time . Completely satisfied with all the services I've done so far .
The chemical used by the professional was a simple mixture of acid and water which destroyed the shining of all tapes of bathroom.
I have taken service to fix my Led TV issue. Technician told ne the black line eill go 8n dome day abd when I reported to urban company no support from there side in warranty period. Don't believe on these tv adds. There service warrant ID totally waste and its sane like local technicians.
Worst ever support, AC maintenance has been carried out in feb 2022, after maintenance water starts dropping from AC, one month taken to assign person for revisit, even alloted persons not arrived or sort out the issue .
Very nice service with good experience about UC
Not returning payment after transaction failed online, however cash was paid to the service agent, but still they didnt confirm with the service agent for it and my money is not refunded, complete fraudsters
Service not available
No foam is being used. False claim by company. Totally cheated. Don't go by this false promise
So pathetic...tried to book for AC service and they have no slots available for 2 days....
It also good service it home üè† for a massage
Booked two tap repair @ 277. Then plumber came. Due to parts amount told was high, we decided to repair only 1. Then 297 charged for only 1 tap repair. (Parts charges charged was extra).
amazing work done by urban clap
Very bad AC services. As long as I didn't call Urban Company my AC was working well. Since first call, I have to call them again and again. I wonder they have made my AC better or worse.
Very bad experience since last 2-3 booking, I am a plus member but every time facing a lot of issues, today booked and waiting as per slot but my booking cancelled after 2 hrs of scheduled time without informing me.
Professional not reached money cut from my account 747and they return 448 cheeter service is not good
Very bad experiance. The person assigned for work will try to cancel the booking and you will end up paying for cancellation and rescheduling . No response from the customer care and the helpline is a joke. Just lost money and time
Very pathetic service. Don't use this app. They deduct charges and cancel the appointment. Legal way of earning.
Good service at convenient prices.
Unable to install the application
Satisfied
she was very sweet and knew her job quite well..felt relaxed after the massageüòç
Very bad experiences while use this app, literally this is the worst app. This is totally fake app. I booked an appointment for servicing my AC. The app shows engg. will visit within 2 working days and charged according to the app, and when they came they charged extra. And i need only servicing of my ac. They why i pay more money to them. And conclusion is this i cancelled my appointment and call local engg to get servicing
The first and last bad experience with Urban Company was inexperienced men, plus they don't even have a screwdriver with them. They littered the whole house. Wrong with advertisment showing that they care about cleanliness but actually wrong. And what about extra convenience fee!! Useless and cheating. Wrong advertisement shown please stop this nonsense
customer service has to improve.
Got my Split AC repaired at reasonable cost
one can really depend on the professional guys!
I will recommend UC
I am satisfied very well
the greatest advantage was that they took an appointment for date and time and stuck to it. ofcourse the service is good.
Total disappointed very bed survice no value of costomer time verry bed
Horrible.... Technician denied ac installation.. He refused and moreover I was still charged for it and didn't get complete refund
Very good
Experience was excellent l
Plzz refund my 1440 rs
It was ok.
shall try
Worst experience this time
good service
Wanted a professional mehendi artist for my friend's wedding ,  half of the bridal makeup arrangement was on me ,  my friend suggested me this app and i requested a professional artist after checking out her profile and art done by her very much impress by this app .nice work
I will advise don't book UC, i was waiting for one day, thought they will resolve the issue but waited till the time but no response from UC. No call service is available that horrible. Really in pick hit wave, they ditch me. I am paying you more than Local guys mechanic. Call center is sleeping mode... Pls don't book and be carefull.
Excellent services
Very very desappoited for not assigned technician, total one day waste my time, .......
Highly unprofessional . Cancelled my salon booking 2nd time in a row. Last minute unapologetic cancellation. Better to book your old salons rather than relying on UC as they will cancel last minute. Apart don't go for hair services as product used are fake. Got major allergy after using their services for Innova hair colour. Undergoing treatment as suffered from major hairloss due to fake product allergy. Customer care is most pathetic nd unable to understand and resolve the issue.
The behaviour of technician was very appreciable.
The workers/technician were extremely polite and professional. Highly recommended.
tf
Excellent service
this hair cut service was very good
good
Good complaint solving
I use urban company every month .. awesome service .
Worst two time denied by service man
I am not happy with your services...you booked my slot for AC service... but you not provide this service.... really feel very bad
Urban clap has grown very well with all their various services that you can receive in a reasonable price. Their Luxe services are just getting more and more satisfying with time. I have a feedback on the booking page, Sometimes while scanning through so many options we tend to forget the multiple services we booked. Hence just as we have a review list during checkout, I suggest if that can be added in the bookings section along with the other details. Thank you.
Useless company.. technicians dont show up or ask you to cancel bookings.. charge you in advance but now on cancellation they would deduct 50 bucks as the professional was assigned (but never showed up).. for a company who aims to provide quality customer experience you guys epitomize on what not needs to be done..
Had a terrible experience, these people charged extra money for premium service and assigned a professional who is so unprofessional, not grommed and did not bring bed for the spa service and when cancelled they couldn't allot other professional for the same service. All they had is sorry for the inconvenience. Feel so cheated with premium service package.
Advertisement in tamilnadu but they can't able to service in tamilnadu I can't suggest to any one
Good service in nashik
Not a trusted service app - I booked the men saloon package and very last minute they have cancelled informing nobody is available to service. I had to cancel and lost plus charge of 299 rupees.
Horrible experience with urban company ac service, the guy remove complete gas within 30 mins, he mentioned me there was some less gas in the ac when I asked how much less and forced him to connect the meter again the meter didn't show any gas inside. He went to get ladder inbetween it is maximum 30 mins gap. My ac is a absolutely new. Don't trust them, they stuck money by telling false statements. No body from helpdesk pickup the call.
Why do we have to pay for the helper that is coming with main technician as a convince fee and why minimum order fee?
I have a submit one complaint but company have no any reply. Thanks Jai Hind
very good experience
professionals are good. but Urban company needs to be little more better in sticking to the schedule and also increase the professional base.
nice experience with company in ac repairing via video consultation.
Good
I bought membership for 1 year and i keep getting message professional not available
ok
Very bad experience
Very poorly handled appointments
Well done
Before taking UC service please go through there online review or you may loose ur appliance.Regretting my decision for choosing UC to repair my washing m/c. Initially atleast m/c was in working condition now it is not at all working. Waste of time and money. Would suggest don't take the UC services atleast for appliances. After damaging your property they will not reimburse anything. ‚Çπ10000 cover up against the damage is totally eyewash. I ended up loosing my washing m/c and no reimbursement.
Good
never worked for me.
very nice

Unprofessional service. I booked it for repair of my LED TV, but I regret choosing urban clap. I never recommend it online. I prefer to go with some known people around you.
They are saying our hands are full for one week and then why for this service..it looks like BSNL service.
Poor service sorry not in service urban clap
book it and enjoy it
Service is pathetic.. really really bad .. support is ok .. at least they gave me a refund ... what's the point
Nice servicr
excellent üëç
Pathetic experience. UC has just 1 resolution to any issue and that is "We are sorry". What do I do with this sorry?? Totally NOT RELIABLE in any manner. Callback request itself is not timely what to expect from the service partners. üòï
Very poor service. The technician never turned up. The appointment was changed after 3 hours of technician wait without my knowledge. This is when they guarantee good technician for members. Even the support doesn't call after raising the issue. I would not recommend them.
need to reduce the service charges.
Experience is extremely good. Would suggest to review the prices once again.
Booked AC service but they have a team of unprofessional technicians who don't understand the value of time. Like auto or cab drivers they cancel the booking or make excuses to not to show up. Slots also don't show for next day. Customer supports says u'll get call back in 15 min but they call after 1 or 2 hrs. It's better to book the service elsewhere rather wasting time on their good for nothing pathetic service.
Not recommended for service of electronic appliances. Don't have customer care support number. Nor call back request is addressed. Nobody cares for the damages to your appliances. AC services is not at all spill proof as they claim. Don't believe on ads, reality is exactly opposite. People are very well trained to find customer fault in the event of damage. Better hire local technician. Atleast he will be easily accessible.
excellent
No contact number provided. Can't speak to anyone for assistance
Worst Service. Professionals never on time. They are 2-3 hrs late. When complained via call back option even the support did not called. No Support from this worst company
First the professional was very unprofessional. He kept on delaying and did not arrive. Later when i raised the issue nobody from UC contacted me. How is this company even running?? So unreliable
Best app
Very poor response against service warranty
Outstanding performance
Assigning professional was not updated
good
satisfied with the service
Worst app No technician were available on your allotted date . I m totally disappointed . Their services are delayed and bad .
Very good service, convenient, affordable. Got my desired cut at home. Thanks Urban Company for making life easy.
HORRIBAL .... STRICTLY NOT RECOMMENDED.... RESCHEDULED TWICE TO REPAIR AC & NO ONE TURNED UP YET & BOOKING IS SHOWING CANCELLED AFTER PAYMENTS. Don't want to elaborate on mail & waste time further ... wish someone reverted before this outburst. Good day
Absolutely no commitment to call back customer on any issue reported whatsoever!
I was so disappointed! and it was so unprofessional! ANAS BUILDING CLEANING the fact URBAN COMP. named your partners as professional!
Please expand to more cities
excellent job
Poor response for geyer service . Difficult to contact them through app.
Unable to make payments.. after clicking pay, its not going to next page.. its been same for last 1 month..
please update your app and stop giving fake promises of giving better services your professional are really giving good service but the clear instructions regarding your services are not available on your app.
good
Excellent range of services by Urban Company. Good professionals doing great work. Very user friendly app.
Their professionals are never assigned on time. They say that the person will be assigned 1 hr before the booked time but they lie. I have booked a haircut for my son at 1:30 Pm and it's 12:55pm now...still no professional is assigned yet. They are very casual with customers and extremely unprofessional. I am sorry but I am utterly disgusted with such careless approach towards business. Would recommend to no one.
They say we will get a callback within 15 mins and we never get a call. Even if you the technician doesn't arrive we are charged 50/- rupees without any of my our fault. Worst and pathetic app.
Excellent service
Wrost company, service, cheater. I got my window AC serviced last season and that was bought in 2017 which was working absolutely fine and I booked urban clap for a regular service, technician told that gas is not there, he said refill is required and charged me a good amount. Now this year I booked local technician for a service they also said gas is not there, i informed last year it was refilled. They said urban clap made me fool. They didn't do anything. Will never recommend this company.
Don't repair my air conditioner properly
Very bad experience, they take the bookings n amount and no professional is assigned till the appointment tine n then they ask u to reschedule or cancel the appointment n u hv to wait for 5-6 days for ur refund becoz of their fault
Wrost service through Urban clap They did not fulfill their commitment that they will (professional Executive) came at 12:30 which did not come and they have not even mentioned any customer care number for complaint.
Good for a few cleaning and repair services. But personal care is useless. Many services are kept in different categories, so that you book two different professionals, even though same person could do all that.
Booking accepted, for the 20th march date but noone assigned for the service, also updated in the app in help center but did not get any response, If you don't have professional available so please don't accept bookings, or give the confirmation to the customers that for the given date you and your professionals are not available so that the customers can see the other options
Perfectly happy with a service
Poor application....no service slots are available whenever I tried to book a service.
Professional not assigned on time and no coustomer support resolve the issue..
good
all time professional are busy why urban company?
Worst experience there aren't maintain their timings slot, without knowing they only cancel the bookings
my favourite partner cum helper
Very bad service.They don't know how to do the perfect work,Also there behaviour were very rude. I approached URBAN COMPANY in order to give me an experienced professional worker. However I had to deal with multiple issues.They are very unprofessional and useless worker.
They never arrive on time. Lie about their location and vehicle breaking down all the time. No way to talk to customer support. The app mentions that they will call back in 15 min, however, they call whenever they feel like. The customer support executive can't even differentiate between Mr. And ms. Pathetic service in every way possible
Last moment no show of booking professional
Excellent
she is quite good in her work and polite too
very good service. I give full mark to this company urban company. Very professional and timely service.
They are playing fraud. First they force you to install their app, then when you select ac services it refuses to give you 100 off even on 1st service. Says maximum limit of redemption exceeded. Lol.
This app is useless. They claim big and influence you to buy membership, but when it comes to utilisation of the services, they don't have slots available. Neither they will provide you service nor they will refund. My advise is to rely on the local service providers as they are much more reliable.
very comfortable service
good service
Very bad experience. First the professional asked me to reschedule. And then the company has been trying to reschedule since 2 days without success . I don't think UC thinks about customer satisfaction at all. I personally will never use it again
Professional feel doing split AC fitment as RISKY. So i recommend UC to take care of it
I was informed that the next service will be for Rs.1 but no such option displayed on the app and I am feeling cheated. I was deceived by the company.
can improve
Always showing all our professionals are busy
Good service
No reposnd theft happen in our house try to contact urban company bt no respond
I bought Appliances protection plan from UC. But when I click on claim warranty it only show something went wrong and there is way to contact customer care. They are total frud who takes the money and don't provide any service.
Additional fee too much cost, not worth to book in UC, repairs cost also high but manageble
great work fully satisfied
very good
UC is not able to control or maintain its technicians properly. Booking made two days before the schedule. Technician called at last minute and asked to cancel service with an unbelievable reason with a negligent voice. They spoiled our day. This is not at all excusable.
This does even deserve for 1 star. Booked an AC technician by watching your TV ads but totally disappointed by your service. No reply from Support an well as technician. Your help desk team does not even call in 15 mins as per promise. You charge rs 50 if someone cancel/reschedule service before 2 hour, in the same way you should make a policy to give complete refund if you technician is late by 2 hours.
Gerting continuously slot expired. Tried with multiple combinations but still facing this issue. Not able to book appointment
Happy with the professional service.
good
An excellent AC repair service will have good customer handling skills and will be able to find the problems of the machine and fix it quickly
Good
Give a princess like comfort in your comfort zone area i.e Home sweet home in affordable prices sometimes with attractive offers.. Must enjoy the Salon Spree now a days.. Full help on any post service issue..
very unprofessional and rude so called professional...i booked repair service for my TV 2 Times...both times no one came...2 days i kept waiting....it is frustrating...i will recommend it to anyone better to go to local repairman than wait 2 days on this app.
Trained and professional technician, who provided good service experience.
Don't book here for making fool
very gud app fr emergency use workers are professional
good service
Pathetic service. It is best to avoid booking Cleaning Services with them. All they do is accept the booking, it has been 2 days since they assigned a professional. If you guys don't have that much of manpower, stop taking bookings altogether. Unprofessional and disappointing.
ONE URBANCLAP TECHNICIAN OVERSMART....
I am really disppointed after purchasing membership plan... Unable to to book any appointment due to error while selecting payment mode... Main thing is whom to contact as no number mention to connect with them... Rediculous...
Not at all good
Great service always.
Water leak and air con not colling after service
A great app for everything. Amazing. Extraordinary
I dont understand app fully. I remember when name was urbanclap. I can select date and then it would show me how many guys are available for service. Now it just says technicians are busy or not available currently. Not sure if this change is intentional but its a definit odd user experience
Cheaters and thugs, had only booked for deep cleaning.. however technician comes fidgets with the ac and it stops working.. and then asks for 2.5 k for gas refilling
After paying full amount, technician not reached home for ac servicing even i called twice he not ready to pick my call i never except this from urban please refund my amount here after I will never use ur services
very good work done
Useless service...why you fooling people,your charges is also not competitive,no benifit to book slot because time bound solution is not here.
Hassle free app and professional executives.
Pathetic Services!! Please avoid!
good job
Excellent
Excellent Service....
Third class service
it was a good
Please improve work quality
Great experience.
Expert
Services are good
Very pathetic experience with UC...they charged in advance and than canell the booking by saying that your phone is not connecting...if charged in advance, address is clear,time slot has been allotted than what's the need to reconfirm again..and they message of cancellation but in aap it is showing that technician has been appointed when you cancel the booking they initiated refund by deducting INR 400...local technician are far better they charged after completing assign services.. uninstalled
Worst service ever. For geyser issue I ordered for technician from UC , technician came and charged 298 rs for nothing he did . He came and saw geyser and told that geyser is perfectly alright. Issue not solved . Totally useless. Not at all worth
Good
Not really with the service, your technicians dont take the pain to clean the parts of the product properly. I think is was waiste of money on the AC servicing.
satisfactory service
Pathetic, they provided me membership discount at 225 & my AC installation was not completed due to space issue, hence they charge me with visiting charges of 350 and while refunding the pending amount they also deducted full mbership amount of 300. If this was the case I wouldn't have taken UC membership. Worst process I won't recommend UC to anyone. Better go with local service stations. They won't loot ypu like UC.
Services are really awesome...with neat procedure
Good app. more services must be added... I. e. maid services, baby sitting services, haircut services for a women
Total Fraud, their rate card shows the item prices way beyond than MRP, the AC technician took full amount from me and installed sun standard fan...beware of they will show rate card and fool customer
Good
Good
Totally horrible experience I had with this company, specially in case of AC service. Every time when they came for service they charged over money beyond the service. I request to you all please avoid this company for your necessary service and repair.
Inspite of making online payment of chimney cleaning on 13.03.22, cash was taken by service boys, not return yet inspite of several follow-up, everything they are making insure to return, but not return yet
Service standard of urban compnay is pathetic. From last two time their professional has not attended services Very poor services. They at their own reschedule the appointment. How unprofessional You guy take amount immediately why don't you refund amount on same day due to failure of your service standard
After ac servicing PCB not working properly.
work followup is not good...
Good service
They are a bunch of thieves. You are better off doing whatever you want to hire them for yourself. They take your money, do shoddy work and shut their customer support so you cannot complain at all. AVOID AVOID AVOID
first time user...
There are only hindi customer service people. Add some for english or telugu.
Frankly speaking your services are not relevant anymore. The charges are very high & still a lot of dissatisfaction with cleaning services. What you are mentioning in your website is totally different from what your professionals are delivering. A big thumbs down. To costly & waste of money. Even a local service provider can be more reliable.
Very good
Had booked for a full home cleaning job in Thane. Very bad experience, the cleaners used the same used Cleaning clothes from another job at our place. The clothes were unclean and smelly. They mop the floor with same cloth as the windows. Cleaning products used were of very poor quality... instead of fragrant the room and bathroom smelled stale and mouldy after their work.
Service is good but repair parts are so costly..
Bad
Customer services is very poor.
very professional service.
Very worst company
Bery bad they r so cheap ban this app
Services delay
Some services are good. But their plumber service is horrible, used them twice now both my geysers have major issues and their only solution is to ask me to book another visit and pay again because their warranty is only for 30 days. The technician uses cheap quality products and urban company takes no responsibility for it. If UC is just a discoverability platform to find useless plumbers without any quality validation, i might as well ask my neighbors and find a good plumber.
Good app
Excellent service
great work
Best service
I wanted to book a slot for electrician. Extra charges showing altogether 139. I don't understand whar all those charges
Booking got cancelled and rescheduled two times But still unable to resolve my issues and unable to provide required services
Wonderful experience.
No customer support call number. If we raise a complaint they call back to tell us what they say is correct. The rate card has a price for sapre parts. But the technician gives a higher estimate. If we raise a complaint, they say it is labour. But I already paid the labour charges. Moreover, AC gas filling (as per rate card) is more costlier than local AC technician.
Good job done by Irfan Ahmed ac tech. But after he left the ac started dripping from right side. Call him he said that the rubber ceiling had to be adjusted. Saying he would rectify in the evening. Please make sure that this issue is solved. Thankyou . Victor Ferns
Good service and great support
great service
Nice experince
good professional job
The services of plumber ,electrician etc has been good.Even that of AC servicing is nice. Only issue is they want to check gas pressure of all ACs, whether new or old. In the bargain even a new AC may lose out. They should check gas only if there is a complaint or it is more than five years. Moreover the people who came were offering 2200 for private filling and 3000 in the name of company. This shows lack of integrity on their part. They should remain loyal to the company. Thanks

I AM FULLY SATISFIED AND HAPPY
Worst payment process, amount deducted but not refunded. Earlier it was good
Worst experience today with urban clap today I service the cube Panasonic ac I booked foam service but they never use foam in this service I told him but they said jaroorat nai hai indoor coil ko saaf proper nai kia abi b back side se rust jama hua hai unse clean krne ko kha to unhone kha iske extra charges lagenge service me kya cleaning include nai kya nd ac cleaning k liye they used my room bedsheet is there professional 1star se kam de nai skta nd no customer care number also
Good service..polite behavior (very rare in Chennai)
has been working as expected, serves the purpose
They have taken away the my hard earned money and no service delivered worst customer service I urged not a make any booking with this company , rude customer care people Many complaint is made but no response
Today, person came for AC service and the service is done, but I am not satisfied as I should hav3 been. Just one thing I felt like different that he did show show me cooling demo after theservice. Heasked metokeep the AC offfor 2 to 3 hours after service saying that the wiring of AC may be wet, soto keep it off for that time. Do not know how the performace is after the service.

job in time,and excellent service

This is worst service and no one calls back after registering multiple complains not even refunding amount or cancel option..
It did not had 0 star or I would have given 0, first time experience last time experience, u guys cannot provide a professional and over and above ur customer care executive shows attitude on your mistake as if we are dieing to take ur services her name was Manvi Kapoor without respect. And she calls her self from escalation dept
Service prices are almost double or triple than the local market. You collect money on the name of membership and maintain unprofessionals on the name of professionals. It's hard to believe that Urban Company have nothing to do with customer once they get membership amount and service amount.
Good
Nice service
Extremely disappointed with the services. What will you do when an aggregator neigher could arrange a technician nor bother to update customer? Zero empathy for customer need, experience and discomfort. Hi
Worst first experience. Happily uninstalled.
Pathetic experience
hi urban company team, I am still facing issue with my RO which after revisit didn't solve my RO water...now I am unable to call ur customer care as no number is provided and I am not getting call back even after raising the issue on app many times..please look into it asap as the water is not suitable for drink and causes hazard to health.
Very worst experience as technicians are not experienced and they misguided us. Forced us to change condenser with new although my company condenser wasn't has any leakage. New condenser does no fit to outdoor unit so they cut fan wings. Now the situation is, my outdoor unit is totally waste. I would not suggest anyone to go with urban company. Bad technicians hired by urban company who makes customers fool.
App provides excellent option to book services, you are also allowed to schedule appointment and beleive me service provider is in time. However please note if your novice on certain elecronic or plumbing activities do not use urban clap. Technicians will find a way to increase pricing. I booked ac service and they have given unnecessary estimates which is not required, if you are novice and wanted book service in UC be prepared to pay more
services provided & check point of check list are impressive. your infrastructure and back office team has actually made it trustworthy. field staff behaviour in terms of services is controlled by back office is Highly impressive. I suggest everyone to use UB services.
excellent work done by the professional cleaning my kitchen and chimney. top quality work and obedient behavior.
Very happy with work of urban company professional
Very bad experience we booked for a carpet cleaning and it was less than 20 sf and the person said no its more than 20sf and he told he won't do and canceled the booking what kind of service is this with customers
Do not respond to issues in commited time. Subscribing for UC Plus membership is a waste of money as they do not give an benefits of the membership as promised. Worst experience consecutively for recent bookings..
Excellent üëç
Professional job
Worest service
Most worest service company poor service
Disgusting appüò°üò°üò°üëøüëø
This is the first time I'm having trouble with urban company, I booked a service and paid for it, even though the professional did not arrive and finish the work they have marked the job complete, even the customer service is not answering the calls, I never expected this with urban company.
Amazing. But, more offers or discounts should be present.

Always unavailable
Urban company was very good but i can't see time slot to select in app for ac service. There is no customer care so i have no idea to whom i can call. I have membership of uc. I won't membership anymore and will switch to other company
the services prescribed are not clear
very good
First time user. Appointed Techie never turned up, and requested me take another appointment. Why couldn't the Techie inform the Company to do the needful instead making me to go through the rigmarol again? Very poor service. Will NEVER recommend.
high performance
Pathetic services I ever take , I schedule my ac service on Saturday and urban clap person came Tuesday without any update I already try to connect them but it's only showing over executive call you after 15 min and no one call me
I wish i could rate it minus 10 ü§¨üò° worst app no slots available 24x7? Don't waste our time pls.
Everyone is giving negative rating yet this app has high rating. This app and business has 1000's of flaws...
Awesome service
Pathetic service also professionals are never on time.
Very bad service

worst company. fake company finally cancelled my booking after fake comitment of 5 day.who will pay interest of five day.worst company i have ever seen
Don't use Urban clap for any kind of service. They come for servicing and spoil the appliance and charge for the spares.
Good
An amazing experience and benchmark Set by UC. You don't feel to stepout and go to salon. You just have to stay at home and get your beauty embrace.
Gyser is continuously in leakage mode and urban clap is saying 30 days warranty is expired and need to re-book. While the engineer assigned to work has come twice and could not resolve the issue then why 30 days timer will be applicable.
Poor service
Took a service for face wax. But I have got cuts on my face. Priviously when u took a service nothing was there but this time got cuts on my cheeks nd my eye brows. Do not recommend to take risk especially on your face.
Never dare to go with this company. They damaged my Ac when I booked deep cleaning service. They are half knowledge-based technicians. It's waste of time and money.
good professional service, knowledgeable personal..good behaviour & co operation..
Good
No use
Not available in my city
Satisfactory
Very convenient app. Please include daily car cleaning services. That would be nice.
Unable to make payment hence can not book the service
Horrible
Perfect
Usefull app good service
Sad experience every single time. Never on time
I'm unable to book for Men's grooming services. There's no option to contact customer care and register complaint. My membership fee is getting wasted .I request for refund my membership fee.Hope the authorities concerned look into the matter and resolve concerned issue.
Seems expensive even concluding all coupons & discounts. Offline services is far reasonable.
Worst customer service,no contact number
Good but can be better
No use
Very bad experience . After 2 days of servicing my ac it's still not working. Never used this app again. If I book a revisit they cancelled it by itself.
Good
Worst customer care
After one year, result is same, U r outof coverage Area, What an service u have.
Worst app ever nd worst 3 clas service ever in my whole life I have received ...plus the which was working fine nd its not working only nd customer care rep does not respond ... unsatisfied üòûüò§

Best App for people staying in Metro Cities.
Bloddy service from customer support. I have sent no of mails mentioning my issues but No one responded. and Not all the beauticians are good. They send stupid untrained Manner less persons in Classic packageand won't take immediate actions atall when customer was I'm trouble with their Service.
Fraud company.. dangerous Don't call urban company.. IAM technician..my amount cheated urban company.. please carefull.. Don't call..
Vary good
Waste of time and Money. Simply imposing cancellation amount ur persons requesting to cancel the booking
Highly unprofessional..!!
Best service
Hopeless services.Dear all, I recommend not to use any services. Not at all customer friendly. Not providing services even after the payment done.
No response for Ac service @kochi.
Very good services..
Best platform for shows urs skill. Thanks urban company

I have booked service with prior payment and the professional didn't come and he updated as completed service.i have complaint but it's been 2 days and no action from UC
Very bad company no humanity
good work
I have made a booking for ac servicing let's see how they are good or bad in this service. Will change my review accordingly on coming Sunday.
Cheater Company
good job
Used Urban company app for the 1st time in cleaning my bathroom. The guys in Guwahati are also professional and do their work seriously.
The most unprofessional and useless service providers. Their so called partners (professionals who deliver your service) are extremely rude and can cancel or reschedule your appointment at their own whims and fancy. They won't even have the courtesy to inform you about the same. Don't bother downloading this app. There are many more options available.
Good work. keep it up.
good
Reduced my eyebrows width. I took a cleanse up. Don't know what cream they used, my skin got rashes. Finally, I had to go to a skin specialist
worse app ever took 10000 from my family for A/c uninstallation & instalation.
Professional reshedule/cancel by there own...miserable experience on festive time .
good
very clean and i want life time service thank you
Good
ZERO STAR NOT ONE ALSO Unprofessional,Advance Money Debited still Not Contact People till BookIng Time.
VERY GOOD SERVICE BY DINESH KUMAWAT

Good company and good partners
was waiting for these services to begin in nagpur. v happy as it has started & hence deleted the previous comment expressing disappointment!!!now v much thankfulüòä
Excellent work
Trying to redeem the 2nd ac service but the app says something broke. It's been 24 hours. The app sucks.
Bathroom √ßleaning partner refused to clean ,says everything inside the washroom turns white and fades away ,he was not at all confident to clean saying stains won't remove in intense deep clean !!
Did AC Cleaning and Service. Awesome Experience. Will consider their other services too in future
mast
very smooth processes
Excellent
Urban company does not provide the basic tools to their service men.. either it should provide or it should ensure its contracting service men possess minimum basic tools.
Good servise
hera and pushpa did the work well
The professional comes only if he wants to
Very useful aap
Good service
Non maintains time
It's an perfect app for any services / repair. Quality assurance and timely commitment
Do NOT buy membership. If you buy membership, your new booking schedules will not be honoured on priority since servicing new members is more important than the existing 'membership-trapped' customers. Your requests are automatically downgraded. Bad experience couple of times over a period of 6 months. Customer service is meaningless.
Awesome service
So far so good
Exilent
I booked for bathroom cleaning but they damag toilet commode while cleaning Bathroom but they were liying didn't pay for that and I raise the complaint to company but they also didn't respond for my quiry was my worst experience ,next time I never used this app for my required
Very expressive
please choose UC for services,they r nominal and good service.
Unprofessional
Excellent Syed Asif
These people are solving real life problems very well. Very happy with the services. Keep doing the good work.
VERY WORST PERSON SEND HIM
THE BIGGEST FRAUD AND CHEAT... THEY DONT REFUND FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR SKIN DONE BY THIER REPRESENTATIVES THEY WONT REFUND IF YOUR PRODUCT WAS DAMAGED BY THIER REPRESENTATIVES AND YOU BUY THE SUBSCRIPTION AND TRY TO BOOK SERVICES THEY WONT ALLOW U TO BOOK HAD MAXIMUM HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND MENTAL TORTURE THROUGH URBAN COMPANY...SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY DO NOT USE THIS SERVICES.

Urban Company service is extremely poor...they promise that our appliances are insured for Rs. 10000, which can be claimed incase of damage during service.....but all this is just to fool customer. I booked an AC service and technician damaged the AC so badly that it is not even cooling now....inspited of UC expert's revisit to address the problem, there is no improvement and UC is showing no response. My both ACs are damaged...I STRONGLY SAY NEVER SERVICE YOUR APPLIANCES THROUGH URBAN COMPANY.
Nice App
Now I'm happy üòä
Excellent
No customer satisfaction. Fan installed directly, not through fan regulator. I am a technician and through it regulator. Please don't call him. Local electrician is a good person and work is fine. Don't call urban company. Wasted my money. Not satisfaction. Please please don't call urban company again.
My bookings are cancelled and not providing service even though booked in one day prior and one more booking 2 days prior experiencing the worst with urban company. Even after prompt payment 48 hrs before pre booking still there is no response and they are cancelling with silly reasons
Great experience for split AC uninstalled and hair saloon service and the process was seamless from booking to OTP to time taken and they provide hair cutting with head message.
Very satisfactory service
This is to dissuade anyone who plans to use the services. Very unprofessional behavior on the part of 'the professional', who cancels just before the service citing health reasons. There is no provision to substitute that professional, instead you have to book a different slot or cancel it, with a cancellation charge BECAUSE the professional doesn't feel like coming. Waste of money, definitely. This is also a waste of time
üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
Worst customer support in service industry. You want to follow Amazon in contacting customer but didnt even able to call after 3 days of opened request. My AC is damaged by your so called engineers and noone is responding. Not even your customer care persons. Unprofessional behaviour..
Good
I've had the worst experience with urban company. I trusted the brand and bought a package worth Rs. 17,648 and the app crashed after I made the payment. On contacting support, they said I'll get a cash back and I've received Rs. 4250 only. On reaching out to them, they affirmed that they'll give me back my money. But they haven't.
Very bad service
So bad 1 week just trying to take appointment ,always same reply professional busy
31/1/2022 experience: Wanted to give 0 star Rating but did not find the option. Worst experience, person requested us to give 5star rating and ended up not responding. He did not clean the bathrooms as promised. We raised customer service tickets many times but we never got a single response. We used to receive a text message saying that your customer service tried to call us but we never received any call from you. It just waste of money for us. 17/3/2022AC servicing experience was excellent.
In last 5 yrs.ncr experience best & regardful in every category household.. Polite and honour for best services.
Useless people , Let us believe on our local Technician itself.... No warranty and no Garunty for their Service or product they change .... within one week of my AC service in Inner unit we got leakage and no response and technician is just asking to close the ticket without doing anything
Booked for AC repair, to 3 days to repair. Again for the same problem after 2 weeks. Booked it under the warranty. Now it's One week. Still not resolved. There is no way to contact customer support. Only call back option is available. They itself schedule the call timing but we will receive call in unexpected timing. And even though I receive the call they will tell the same thing "We will talk to the professional and your issue will be resolved today". Now they even stopped calling.
No issues Excellent
good service
Very bad post service claim/follow up.
my experiences have been great by the services i have recieved so far
1st time booked ac service. That was amazing. Agents were very polite n efficient also. Thnk u urban clap
Worst AC uninstallation all gas was gone and they r saying no warranty for gas , gas is not covered under warranty of service.
Pest control is not at all effective. Customers time and effort to empty kitchen and putting back things in kitchen goes waste.
Professional service.App should be more user friendly
cool services at your fingertips
I had to reschedule my a/c service for one day as there is mismanagement by the company. After paying it prior and booked the schedule I had to suffer for that.
Bad company
Can't find service in my city
Very very poor experience these days with salon services. We r paying such huge expenses on top of that this kind of experience every time is not accepted. You should have a proper customer concern resolution team who should assist us in case of any dissatisfaction. Like Swiggy. Learn from them how a client centric service is given!!
Very good
It was a really nice
üôÑ
Noice app
I've been receiving all the services upto my expectations.
Good job
Pathetic.. they are cheating customer. Never arrive on time.. no response from the person.. no way to contact them... Don't waste your money on the annual fee.
I booked one AC service, I was so occupied still I came back home as technician was supposed to come, but no one turned up, not even a single call. No customer care number on app, they say they will call back but that also they failed to fulfil. True example of unprofessional company, this is my first and last order with urban clap.
Worse experience, scheduled visit 2 days back but till now technician have not visited and even when I have raised a call back haven't received any call. Can't contact customer support.
Good
I recommended a friend and I'm still waiting for the 50 dirham to be credited to my account despite speaking to someone so won't be recommending again plus what is with the waiver fee why can't it be added to price instead of adding it at the end
We have lodged a complaint that our belongings were damaged by the professional during service and it's been 2days after lodging complaint in the app and still neither the issue was resolved nor we are getting any call from urban company.we have not expected this sought of customer service from urban company which is highly disappointing
I bought a cleaner and she wasn't good and she said that finish the cleaning then left me !!!! I used ti say ur good company abd now I'll give u half a star if I could !!
UC's Rajbhar who attended....Am fully satisfied with...
It is very very useful app for work
very good services
Worse experience with urban clap, useless app, unprofessional and unethical agents
Chting hua mere shat mera 10 hajar nhi mila
Good service
Company have professional worker
AWSm
Excellent AC servicing
she was very polite and very sincere to his work
No more a trusted service or Company where you can rely on. They all cheated the customer.
Worst experience. Urban staff were heavily drunk. Akso all the parts given for repair were not returned... I will not prefer to gor for Urban Clap
Best by all means...
Worst service provider. Recently I got my AC repaired by Urban Company and the technician was unqualified. The problem was Gas leakage he filled it but did not tighten the screw properly and Because of which over a period of time the gas leaked again and by this time the warranty period was over and Urban Company didn't help in any way. Lost the trust in Urban Company. They are just interested in collecting money but no proper response. Never ever going to trust technician from them.
UC Team is doing recommendable job to the best customer satisfaction. Till now experienced last three years AC servicing job done by UC professionals. Hope all other services from UC will also render the same customer satisfaction. All the Best UC Team !!!
Excellent work
Good
Worst experience. They didn't repair my ac properly and they charge for 1600 rs. After 1 week same problem I face. After that also they are not able to repair my ac properly. Don't trust urban company they cheat my money . They are not eligible enough to solve your ac problems. So don't waste your time and money
The result reflects
Worst experience, booked a salon spree today and the customer service representative called at the last moment and told that no one is available today and asking me reschedule or cancel the booking. If no one is available why it got accepted at the first place?? I have my plans because of this i have to change my plans at the last moment. Disappointed
STOP CALLING AND BOTHERING PEOPLE
good
good service
Awful üòñ, I booked my service request on 13.03.22 as the slots were not available on 14th I booked for 15th. I got call from customer care stating that 15th technicians are completely booked 16th they cannot help so on 17th they will send technicians for service. Again on 17th I got call from customer care that maximum by 5 o'clock in the evening the technician will visit and in next one hour time they called me back and said on 19th technician will come I don't know how indefinite this will be
Pathetic app the consultant arw always busy I am trying since last 1 week if there were any ratings in - I would have given it -5
Used to be good. Now they have completely eliminated customer service. There is no number or dial in or helpline, the only way to speak to a rep is to request a call. AC technician has been in my house for 8+ hours for a simple servicing assignment, I have requested a call back 4 times,been given a slot to expect a call back. It has been 2 hrs since then but no sign of any call. At this rate even if they damage or steal you are at at urban company's mercy. This is a serious issue.
Not satisfied
AS PER AVAIL SERVICE, GOOD EXPERIENCE IS WITH THE COMPANY.
Worst customer service i have experienced with online marketing
Worst service provider. Doesn't value customer's time and doesn't have the decency to inform in advance that a professional is unavailable for the service despite making a 24 hrs prior booking. Idk why UC is even operating in cities where it can't commit to the bare minimum.
Good service
I am very disappointed...they are just looting comman man money.

Excellent
good work .....
THEY WILL MAKE YOU WAIT.. THEN DITCH YOU IN THE LAST MOMENT.
happy with urban company great experience
Worst service provider. So rude & unprofessional. I booked the service for AC servicing in the wake of Corona. No problems at all. After a couple of days, my AC stopped working. Completely. I booked for repair, the person signed didn't turn up. When I called him, he said that he will be late, later he told won't come & later he asked me talk to company. When I rescheduled, he said, "do whatever u want, but i will not come". It is as if I'm rooting 4 him. Rude. Dont trust this service provider.
vv good
GOOD
Booking lete ho service nahi dete ho refund dete ho wo bhi 5-7 working days
excellent service
Cheaters they are charging extra than told. On app they say all inclusive but on payment page they charge convince fee
Urban Company=Day light robbery
Really no point being an UC plus member... no service, no way to contact customer care and they don't even call back... rubbish experience..
Kindly choose her.
Excellent
Worst experience ever, when it was urban clap, it was good, but now hell of an experience
Even after becoming plus member, not getting professional services. Ac technician cancelled 2 times and not picking phone either. Now the next visit date is after 2 days.. Totally disappointed.
Excellent üëç
Good
Repaired washing machine. It is completely not working now . Also charged double for me. I raised issue nobody from UC resolved. Worst dont prefer this. Ever worst UC spare s cost is too high. I made mistake by giving one more chance to UC. Ever worst
very nice service, I hope you have continued good service.
Waste company
They are unreliable if you want to get the job done in less time. Sometimes there are no professionals even on Plus Membership. They used to serve well. Those days are over. Not recommended. There are many new young and enthusiastic alternatives in the market.
Had best experience
urban services have improved a lot in the last 6 months after taking over by Tata .
You guys are cheaters. Taking 149 for a simple hair cut for 1 person and for 2 it's 449 it's too costly. And even you guys don't pay that much amount to employee who comes for Haircut. Top costly and payhetic service.
Worst service
high price
No way to contact customer service. They never call back and just send message that that tried to call back.
Third class ek Dum wahiyat service booking karte hai professional available nahi cheater time waisting I suggest ALL don't book any order because totally waisting time ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ I use 1st time app but experience is very poor
Nice interface and great work from their people
Very bad experience....careless staff....no responsibility..no machinerys.....totally bakwas.
I applied a valid discount coupon as first time user, and get a 10 percent discount. But during payment step, the price is increased back to original
It's not Professional very unprofessional they WASTE my whole day by assigned and cancel.. It's better ki find local expert.. for any work by Google
it's good
Third class company, fraud. They just book service for getting the visiting charge from customers. Then they say parts is not available. Experience from booking washing machine repair
it was a nice experience.
Very terrible service Made an at home salon booking three days prior to the date and i received a call on the day of the appointment stating that slots were full. This is not the way to treat a customer.... If slots were full then the app shouldve shown the same. This is equal to cheating and I'm very very dissatisfied. Will not be using this app again or recommending it to anyone else.
Excellent
Downgrade service . I booked the AC service 3 days before but still AC service not assigned
good work
Good service. Booked for servicing of my three 1.5 ton split Acs and got the service at an average cost of Rs.500. Better than local service who use blowers to remove dust while UC uses water cleaning technology which is better. Local cos charge 750 for a 1.5 ton split ac.However, I hv also booked for haircut, but they did not turn up.
Good response and punctual
Very convenient
Deputed well trained technician for service of split ACs. Attended as per time slot fixed. Extended good service.
Any time slot not available only. West urban company zero stars. India urban company nember zero.
Damaged my Home appliances Inverter.. Electrician not at all professional.. since 20 day's they are saying they will resolve my problem but no use.. Still not resolved my problem Waiting for Urban company to resolve it ASAP..
So a lady came foe salon at home. Hwe rating was 4.8. She came hald an houe late on the pretext that she had to drop her daughter to school. Well if your coming late inform or dont book if u cant balance your woek life. Then she started bad mouthing clients who had complained that she comes late and indirectly hinying that those clienys are so rude. Then she did threading amd cut my chin, i had a scab and now a scar. Her waxing was also bad, hair leftover and rashws.
So far I used UC for two times and both the times, the technicians were on time and did their work perfectly fine. Good App to find multiple services at one place.
Very bad policy of limiting follow up to 3 days, which is not always practical. Even after submitting proof of damage by their professionals, they refused to do anything about it because i called them a day late.
Super Excellent
Absolutely useless. They confirm bookings and later cancel.
Not working in Singapore. Can not pay and book
Better work ...can be still improved a lot.. by sharing a great detailed video of AC cleaning by your professionals on what's app of customer before technician visit the site on customers number or a video chat from your end after completion of services or asking the technician to share or upload the picture while cleaning the ac step wise so we can be sure and everything goes nicely excuted...still happy for first time experience though...app interfece is good. technician are local so better
Nice and very useful
No service available, every time his professionals are busy
If you cancel they will deduct 50 rs... Why and how? I had selected certain time slot but mechanic did'nt came on time hence I cancelled but why you fraud people are doing cheating with innocent customers.... Stop using this bullsheet service
Worst service by ac technical guy... 1 star also not interested to give..
They are not providing services in Al Reef.Disappointed
Nice
Service is exceptionally good. Quick completion of assigned work with perfection. Being so impressed, I recommended Urban Company to my neighbour too.
Very bad experience with Urban Clap. They were called for installation of 5 ACs. One of them did not work as gas was not put properly. They took full money and said they will fix the AC. They never came back. Chor company.
Nice
Good job impressive
Great Company, good workmanship
Great experience
Guys all professionals are not so good. Be carefull while anyone place request. They come and provide dent to your original machine and ask us to replace any part. Please as per my suggestion always book service of your any company product from company service team. Urban clap team you people are really making experience worse in repair and service . Really worse experience . What should I do with my damaged machine
Absolutely horrible experience. Clearly there's no method or filter with respect to partner vendor selection. The AC service men who ended up as a result threatened me and my husband.
Wrong booking price are very increasing
Vary. Bad for urban company service for not support for urban club team very bad for urban club my many is vsst for my many
good
Had booked bathroom cleaning for 2 bathrooms x 3 services. However the app shows professional unavailable for this booking. Whereas the professional is available for new booking (same service). Also there is no chatbot or call centre to assist.
poor service . increased my ac service by 200, even though I book at low price and prepaid.
good app
Initially the services were good but now a days worst experiances regarding schedules......back to back 3 experiances about slot and executives were worse
FRAUD COMPANY
in chennai the professionals are so rude and greedy. they just suggest other issues and ask for money directly
excellent
You dont evwn deserv 1 star ur beautician did not even come n i was waiting
Be careful, AC uninstallation package says that, they will close the whole after AC uninstallation but technician doesn't agree to do that. It's a lie in package.
They creating more problem in your air conditioning.. Today I feel that.. the good and excellent condition ac not working today because of the booking in urban company.. the worst ever ..
very professional
Good
I did uninstall my AC unit. It was done in a very smooth and professional manner.
Making our life easier and better.
Very nice and very friendly
I try 4 time other profftional but Shery is the best of them
Good
Perfect company Urban Clap. Good work
I wish there was half a star as an option, because these guys suck at cleaning. They made a mess in the other room and left...
Best service providers in beuty service
Very bad experience..
very clean work done
Really a very relaxing and amazing massage session from Mr Bala the massage therapist
Don't make yourself an aggregator, focus on complete in house model
Worst experience with urban clap team, without checking the leakage , technician filled the gas and now they are saying it's not their problem.
save our time
Yes late but Technician arrived and he has done a good job... Thanks
üôÇnice
Amazing experience
Excellent AC service by professional people. No mess. Cleanliness good. Takes adequate time for service.
Very bad service . Used product are not that good ... Dissatisfied with the service .....
good
Worst app! Unprofessional behaviour of employees towards the customer and not giving the billing amount in the start. They add extra amount and let us know in the end. I would suggest to go get a local vendor from justdial who would provide far more better service with reasonable cost providing the billing amount at the initial stage and with good service. Don't go for this or else you might waste your time and money both!
Fraud...technician will spoil your AC 100%
i orderd for complete stain removal that is around 677 rs. he cleaned thoroughly after my compulsion but in that package it has written that they will remove the complete hardwater stains, but they removed some extants but not fully, that boy told that i spent one and half hour, i dont have extra time.
good job by Parvej
Good
perfect üëå
Verry bad experience with urban company I have booked carpenter for my maindoor repairing waited for 3 hours after advanced booking then they said no one is available to serve you verry disappointed with this please verify first who can be available to serve the people otherwis don't take bookings #thirdclassservices #thirdclassurbancompany
Superb service
No professional is assigned till the slot mentioned in booking.Is it negligence for membership that I have or poor management?
Wonderful work done by the technician.. Solved the Washing machine problem in minutes.Thank you UC team.
Nice working
good service
Excellent app and excellent service.
Very good
UC should provide service in Kannada. There's no option to choose preferred language for communication with UC customer care.
v nice service provided.
invoice was not proper.
Expert technicians and affordable price.
The following comment was from 2019. As on date i find UC service excellent. It's stress free since professionals are really knowledgeable and well mannered. Booked service with UC.. Not only the person hasnt arrived, on multiple follow ups she keep promising to be there but no clue and not answering calls. No help from Urban Clap either.
The beautician assigned was good no problem was with her the problem was with the product Elysian wine facial and bleach after my service my face was worst I got irritation all over the face very much disaaapointed with the product ...
Excellent job üëåüëç
So Bad
Very pathetic, i booked AC service and paid the asked amount with suggested tip as well, and urban clap assigned the technician as well. But on scheduled day and time i even didn't get any updates from urban clap. Niether they answere the calls. Now if I cancel the booking or change/reschedule they will charge 50 (because they charge after they assign the technician) now will they give me service by reducing the charges no. They assign the technician very fast to charge the client if they change
I opt for home paint service from Urban Company which is my biggest mistake ever For paint services they are zero, very unprofessional staff for this service, very very unprofessional painters who will make all type of promise regarding after sale service but after finishing the job paint is peeling off from so many places. I made a complaint several times but no positive response from company and painter as well Very disappointing Please dont even try paint service from urban company
good
Been three days I've been trying to get a professional for my air cooler, the representative first lied that there were no professionals for the service and the next day, they said they are having technical issues and the third day the issue continues and was told that the issue has been ongoing for more than 3 days. No resolution thus far. You've got to stop lying to your customers,super unethical from the company side. Others, please do not get involved with UC,you are better off helping self.
good service
Liked Urban Company especially , plumbing, electric , AC .
perfect servicing for all 5 ACs, hardworking professionals, did exemplary job in servicing & did a thorough clean up afterwards, super happy
there is no way to contact UC. in chat they say they will call in 15 mins and nobody calls. and now there is a cancellation fee applied while nobody arrived for the service. great customer care you guys!
Kindly check what products the technicians are installing , the reality is that they charge for UC brand product where as they actually put very cheap local products we have to pay the price of branded product. Horrible experience.
excellent and professional.
Very professional.
gud service and nice beautician
Maine 1st time Booking karwai thi...or payment bhi maine advance dal di thi...or next ye apni commitment se badal gaye...1 cal aata Hai inke Coustmer care se...jo apke service kai liye person aa raha tha unki mother bimar ho gayi hai...who aaj nahi aa payega...I understand maine bola chalo koi baat nahi aap koi or dusra bhej do..fir 10 min baad dusra cal aata hai kai apke jo techniques service karne kai liye aa raha tha uska accidents ho gaya hai...who aa nahi payega...jhoot bolte hai ye log...
Good service.

It says it doesn't give service in my area...I'm disappointed üòî
very nice application üëç
Mr. Vikki Kumar cleaned my kitchen very well.Will you be very happy to clean up once with the Urban Company Very reliable company
They have absolutely inexperienced technician with them. I called for my AC service he came and damaged other parts . I called for a Water Purifier service he came and said I cannot help call Aquaguard people for service. So they have Pathetic Service and team of technicians. Wastage of money and time with these people.
Very unprofessional , neither customer care cares about you nor service agents , no one cares for time , and there is no number to call they assure call back within 15min but after 30 min no call , very disappointed with service , Even executive didn't reach you on time and you wanted to cancel or reschedule they will charge you 50rs . It should be waived off as soon as time breach . Never recommend this service .
Vry gud experience.
very good Service
perfect
excellent
The most unprofessiona terrible and Horrible app I have ever come across..... tried booking a spa service 4times and every time the professional denies to come as it's inconvenient for them.....and they only reschedule or cancel the appointment.....the customer service is also of no use....they say they wl call u in 15mins and just give a missed call and than they send a message saying the problem is resolved....very bad experience and suggest never use this app....
good service
Nice Work done by Urban Team.
Without consulting me they have rescheduled the appointment for my AC service, it was scheduled for 15th March 2022 at 9am and the technician didn't turn up and I raised a complaint on the same and to my surprise the date was rescheduled to 16th March 2022 at 8am
perfect
Daylight cheating happened with me from them, had given 5 star before, but need to drop the ratings below zero now. I have booked urban clap for AC uninstallation in 2020, due to corona couldn't check it until now I tried to reinstall it, again as an premium customer called UC again, now they are saying copper wire broken inside by the uninstalling professional and I need to pay them 13K to fix it. If you want professional service, don't go cheapbut book authetic AC manufacturer partner.
Salon service is awesome and app is easy to use user can choose the service as they wish. hassle free appointment booking. Neha well trained polite and very punctual.
Please give my money
Fraud app cheating with people
Ok
Very bad Urban company
Since a month i have been contacting the customer care but none of them are responsive. The app is a disaster and so is the customer support. Further, this is a scam. They have discontinued my account since long but still asked to take the premium membership which is utterly a fraud. Please request you spread this fraud business of urban clap.
Bakbas experience
Everytime trying to book service for AC I'm getting error that no professional available, fix this ASAP !!!
This is to much stupidity
Cheap
Very bad experience .
Unprofessional behaviour from app and professional both. After fixing appointment he came one hour late
Good
Worst experience ac technician came and changed the gas and no acknowledgment till now already 6 days completely and I'm chasing daily but the technician is not evn responding atleast urban company should make trust among the Coustmr worst service I don't recommend this urban anymore.
Good & beautiful prompt response
If your service are not available on any pincode you should tell on first page not during payment selection page. Waste Application
Very unprofessional, unskilled work man was send to me.he had least intreast in doing the work. To rude,n with lot of attitude as he was doing me a favor n and not his job Did not fix the fan , nor did he cleaned the mess . After paying him still I m sitting without my work done
Very helpful app
No service in my area pin - 245205 garhmukteshwar

Very bad services
Services provided by UC is too good
Payment gateway such as Amazon Pay not available
Great swift clear communication

This is second time in a row, when I wasn't provided the service at the booked time. They reschedule it as per their time availability. Highly disappointed.
happy
Nice
very good and patient , neat work
Very very very good
I got very good service from them each time and if there was an error it was quickly resolved by the urban clap team. Happy with their services
service too late
Worst Experience!!!! Please don't use this Urban Company!! Even 1 star also waste!! Since there is 0 stars so selected 1
Worst service provider ever. They charge you while booking the slot and then don't provide the service. It has happened to me many times. It is waste of time nothing else.
good
good work

So high rate for ac installation and uninstallation
Today I booked service for ac .. first of all service guy come late . And after service the ac is not performing well not cooling.. I raise the complain but no one come to visit please do not take any services from urban company ...
Company has set high rates
very neat and clean work and fully satisfied with your work
Great
good service
Very professional..convenient and amazing job
Very friendly
All my wallet cash and credit seem to have expired. My wife has requisitioned deep cleaning of sofa today and your representative seemed surprised that wallet cash/credit has expired, and that too without any intimation to me. Could someone find time to call me and explain?
fome light spary
Loved the app and services provided here
Wrost service
great
nice
Worst experience, no punctuality. No one showed up for work. No response from support service. I will not recommend this
very good
Customer support needs promptness + pls call out your customer support numbers on website/app
Too much costly.
Unable to contact UC CC for any issues with the service person
Booked appointment. But no executive came.Already deducted amount.
very professional,well behaviour, excellent work
Good app.
‚úåÔ∏è
Decent team . worked nicely .
All hype, no respite. Whenever I try to book a service, I am told that all the technicians are busy and no schedules are available. Useless!
good
Worse app I book on 10th March for Sunday for chimney clean on Sunday I get call thay we can't come on time than they did not reschedule my service m now m massaging urban for last 3 to 4 day no one is reply or answering anything I just see msg that we will call you within 15 min I suggest everyone never use this app service
Nice
good services
service was very good s satisfied
there are few options in carpentry which I am not able to book, else perfect .
good work done
good sirvice
I booked a foam ac service. The service boy did not know that there is something like this. He said we do normal service. UC should train and give all the required resources to do the job. Luckily UC refunded the foam service charges and only took charge for lite ac cleaning The service man did not have foam and did not know that there is something called Foam service. He said the company has not provided us with any foam
Chor ka company
Suggested application for all our needs Thank you for your support UC we loved it
will recommend other for this company. Glad with the cleaning service.
Good
The kind of unprofessional technician you guys assign that he upfrontly asked to cancel the service when I am with your customer service over the con call. But customer service is very supportive (Ankit) but that will not help bcoz again technician is the one whom we are dealing.
The service is fairy good but they are not coming at time and canceling my booking although I have paid all booking money really disappointing üëé
high price
perfect performance
good app , For Home services
Worst app and no proper communication from UC, third class service provider.
thank you so much for your fantastic service
I was quite satisfied with services till one bad experience. I notified them and they are not giving complimentary service as well as complete refund back. I will definitely choose other options rather urban clap. They don't care for serious feedback and customer experience.
In app it was charged INR 139/- per service . Whereas your rate card shows service for pillar cock is INR 119/- per service. While booking there is no option to distinguish between Pilar cock, Bob cock, angle cock etc. This do create nuisance after service done. In either case when actual charge is high then booking or vice versa, customer feels cheated, by hiding information.
excellent
Its not getting operated well
What a waste scamming app. Not updating coupons nor using wallet cash without any notification or update. Waste of time
Bad Experience
Excellent and Professional service by Geetha.
The working people are good. But the customer service team in the urban company is not well organised .
Paid INR 947 with Plus membership intending to avail 2 servicing. After first servicing, now balance is shown as zero. Interestingly no customer care number and email id to contact or support section in app and website. Even thieves, have some ethics. These are decoits. Do not waste your money. Go for professionals in your nearby area. I am complaning to District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.
Like this
Very bad Un experienced professionals for men salon
Fraud peoples fraud app.this peoples deleting my reviews.
The customer support is always unreachable
useful for everyone
Satisfied
Excellent service.
Yes my experience with UC was awesome.
Don't be fooled by the names like royal or prime. Go to a professional of you need a message, go to uc if you need a person who did more messages. Not all the masseuses are good with the techniques. I'm taking pain relievers to sleep on the night of the message. Imagine that.
Forward
What is wrong with UC ? Why there are so many bad reviews. I am scared of using services. Don't even see anything done for those complain except regret replies.
After service is completed, the unit has a noticeable gap between unit and the wall. It was not there earlier.
Every thing from start to end is faulty in urban clap,the so called professional never showed up, didn't even pick calls.They were unable to provide any other person as I needed the services urgently and i had prepaid for it, even extra for a special slot.The coupon i used for being a first time user was not used,but got wasted.I need that coupon again,would like to be considered as first time user only.I had to give one star because their is no option for negative rating.So disappointed.
It's too worst... There is no proper professional or technical persons... So don't use this application... Example: ac propessional came two times for installation and damaged my ac.. he don't no what he is doing.. just taking money from customers... Waste of money... ***After serving my ac working like heater... Super technical person*****
Aarti was scheduled for my appointment. She came on time and served well on time.
Love This
Farod company hai urban company koi bhi new joining mat karo bhai please........Chet company hai
Don't download the app.. Waste of time.. Worst customer service.. There is no person for service...
Terrible.

Worst service
She was very polite and professional . Neat and clean. Done very good facial and waxing. Me satisfied. God bless her.
Satisfactory service. The AC Technician was knowledgeable and thorough professional. Customer care service efficient and prompt. I will definitely use Urban Company more often.
I don't recommend UC. Very horrible experience with the service. Guys please don't waste your time and money.
Very poor service. Professional canceled as he wanted to come early. Will never recommend this kind of behavior. Wanted to give zero star
You havnt added punjab state yet in this i am an professional makeup artist but is unable to use it please provide it as soon as possible

Why is there no pedicure for men????
prreferable
too late service
Urban company is a good paltform
Excellent service
Very bad service
superb... systematic service
Upselling by fraud is a primary business
App is user friendly but services are pathetic. Their partners (the one who actually provide the service around Kukatpally, Hyderabad) are hopeless.Urbanclap charges 50 extra towards safety of their staff and the staff doesn't follow any protocols. No satinization or even cleaning as per videos.Their videos are so deceiving and fooling people reality is not even close to what they show in the video. Most of the partners cancel appointments 30min prior. It's a shame that their services worse now
I will never use this app again in my life , wrost experience
soooo good
Great service
Extremely poor and bad experience. Regretable and intolerable attitude of staff
No way to reach customer support before booking the service horrible!
very good cleaning work
urban company is quiet good....
Overcharged by > 3x. I ordered a control panel repair for my microwave. The model's control panel membrane costs 550 online and 500 in stores. However the standard rate says its 1700+ convenience + labour charges. How do you set your standard rates 3x high, without even a basic market research?
Uc very conviniently makes a fool of their client, they mention the warranty of appliances on the app, but when the time comes they agree with their technician who damaged my AC while servicing, which caused gas leakage and the cooling was gone.. And now they are refusing to resolve the issue and asking me to pay for the gas filling.. Am amazed of theirs unprofessional behaviour.. Now what they will do is they will reply to this review with their nonsensical apologies and will do nothing.
Everthing fine well behaved staff.
Nice experience
good
Pathetic app. Address saved is Mumbai where it shows we can't serve outside of Delhi ncr whenever I initiate the booking.
Bad service
I haven't received any referral amount. Tried couple of times but seems fooling us with referral program.
good service
After service they don't entertain you. They simply start knit picking things and will ultimately blame it on you. Especially their A.C. technician. Please dont use their services.
Great work by Staff Ganesh.Keep up the good service.Thank you .
Great App to be used
excellent job
Happy with urban company ac service !! It's easy quick and reasonable
She is very good.

Did not a professional assigned till the very end moment and had to follow up for updates.
Worst experience ever... Once I booked the appointment, They rescheduled it thrice... Finally they cancelled it due to technician unavailability...
I am new with this app, so I face some difficulties.

Worst customer care service.... Has booked a service.... First they rescheduled saying all the professionals are busy. Second day the professional was not lifting the phone, these customer service people are not at all responding.. no update .. no time sense... Worst of worst people
Unable to book service. No response from customer service
good service
good service. Will contact again for further services
executive forced for rating and demanded to give positive feedback
very good company
nice experience
Keep getting msg 'Something went wrong' when I try to add a plumbing service. Never used this app before. Feeling cheated for buying UC plus membership.
The worst experience . I had booked for a haircut at 11am but it's 12.30pm now and the service agent hasn't contacted me nor he is attending my calls. The support agent whome I reached out is suggesting to reschedule for another day or in the evening. If I can't get a service on the scheduled time, why are you even running this app or this service? Kindly learn how to provide a service or how to provide support. Clearly just not fit for either. This is a total waste of time and service. Unhappy
Good app for House appliances
Very nice don't hesitate to download and book a service polite staff and well behaved and mannered
Good technician, he is cool and understand the problem. Servicing done by him is good and neat. very cooperative technician.
very helpful, it hasn't resolved but you will get fare idea with video call.

Impossible to get in touch with customer care. I asked for RO water purifier installation. They sent me the RO, never installed it and marked the job as completd. Now won't call back. There is no customer care number to be found online.
Good
very nice üëå
Very clean and fabulastic service... Go with URBAN COMPANY
Very bad.not at all punctual about time.
Worst experience had with the technicians they spoil the stuff and blame us.
Pathetic Experience!!! First of all this professional is a big ripoff. The first thing he will tell you is the air-conditioning gas is low. I literally laughed because I did an Airconditioner service from Urban Company from the different professional literally 24 hours ago and he showed me on the meter the gas is fine and I knew because I have enough knowledge about it. I ended paying 5k INR plus. After the service the professional had an audacity to tell me again that the AC gas is low. Bravo
This app has not much offer for their regular customers
Apart from service, they also charged for training fees. Why customer pay training fees. If customer purchase a service that means professional should be appointed which gives expected service. Customer don't pay you for what are you doing internally in the company. Whether training or anything else. Its not value for money. Pathetic business plan.
Excellent
Very helpful
Beware those who are doing such service, who are using foam, in such service, it explodes, my child got injured because of it
Satisfied with service
The Best Services in India
Iski service bewkuf hi hoga professional ko bhukha mar degi ye compny
Awesome and allservices are good
Professionals specially salon ones do never come on Saturday and Sunday . Pathetic customer care. I guess their main source of income is rotating money between booking and cancelation. Issue - booked pedicure on Thursday for available slots on sunday. No one assigned. Customer care executive has no control says no one available Irony - If we cancel there is cancelation fees but no such provision for urban company if they keep u waiting and cancel Supervisor not available for escalation
Experiencing worse service from urban company...Your application is not up to the mark ..It shows Amazon pay offer on payment ,i transferred 700 to my Amazon pay balance and then when I am going to pay , there's no option of Amazon pay to execute order. Now my 700bucks got stuck in Amazon. This is not expected from UrbanC.
Quick service.Result available within 12 hours.
No proper reversal from the helpcentre. Just apology always for service goofs.. The technicians are good but the helpcentre are just pathetic. The app too has not user-friendly to update the customer complains..
Worst experience by this ac servicing person, they'll allot the person but the person won't come either lift out call..he did damage to my ac and left and no phone calm,and no customer service help too very bad experience for the QST time in my life
Crrnr fopq will
She was not only professional but also a very soft spoken and well mannered girl.
nice app for all useful services
please don't use the segment prime classic or either clarify customer that if prime booked so u can't hv additional service from classic or luxe
Nice experience

Facing app working issues and option to contact customer care directly.

My experience with urban company was very bad
super
Great service experience.
Very bad. They called several times to confirm ask address...when I had already confirmed booking & given my address on the app. Unprofessional. Also execs cancel bookings on their own whim.
Very poor & unprofessional. Reps touched everything ours even during covid. Also,they call you 10times after booking,to confirm your booking&confirm the registered address even after us having done all that online. Better to call your local handymen/parlor didis. They make fewer calls to us any day
Yah company bahut hi ghatiya aur bekar Hai Achcha Kam Nahin Karti Hai Chor Company hai. The partners of a company tell us that the urban company is very poor‚òπ
happy with the services by professionals
awsome
Worst experience with urban clap üëè the professionals are very low cadre very unethical.. no solution is sought out by urban clap I called a service professional for cleaning my bathroom the guy Simon maith he was very rude and unprofessional he broke my shower fitting it is leaking now and he didn't clean the tiles properly stains are there I took a photo and attached to urban team and had given a complaint but there is no response from urbanclap people  Worst ever experience

The company is providing wide range of services at a high price without any actual discount to it's members and charging for safety kit but not proving safe services and the kit seems to be missing in all my previous bookings.
Bad experience with carpenter work. Money waste.. Other av and washing machine work r good.
Unprofessional and unapologetic service providers. After damaging my refrigerator they have the guts to reply that they can't do anything. Utter nonsense from customer service providers. Please refrain to opt any service if you care about your valuable items.
Nice
It's safe and happily go for it
Very professional work
Excellent service offered by Urban company, Technician are also Very efficient & behavior also in good Manner. After servicing My Daikin Split AC, Now it's cooling effect also increased. Lot of dust inside the Indoor unit, they are cleaned with Foam, Awesomeüëçüëçüëç

Please don't install app. All customer support and services provider both are fraud. This is a urban cheat company üò°

Nice service provider, I'm very satisfied with UC
üëç Nice and very professional people
The person who came to my home was very friendly and made my sofa cool and good looking thanks a lot. So, saying about urban company is just amazing . Ur thought is really good I appreciate u. The main thing is the people can't come out and who r unable to come it is very useful for those people.üôÇüôÇüòä Thank you
excellent

Excellent service
Wst
Why isn't bathroom and toilet not mentioned separately... This is very furious to know that the service I booked for was only for bathroom. Where is the service for toilet. The bifurcation isn't mentioned. This is a new way to cheat the customers.
V good
App doesnt meet the need.No helpline no..customer service is not hleping to resolve issue.Things are circling back only...
Awesome
Pathetic service
Bad customer service
For manicure and pedicure the professionals carry limited gawdy colours. Finally we have to let go of nail polish part. The nail polish remover is substandard, it's acetone leaving nail dry and damaged
Hi , I got good service from UC. Technician reported timely and completed assigned work satisfactorly.
The worst experience professionals will not attend , and this is total bogus company ... This will not provide any service , I amfacing the issue from last two attempts , we are just waiting for him for past 2 hours and we have cancelled all programs and waiting for profession , in mean time we just received massage from company that services was cancelled , in mean professional contacted us for address ... I don't know what was happening , these is not a prepaid service , post paid service
Services have deteriorated recently. There professionals are delayed by significant amount of time almost always now. Also there are many inexperienced professionals in their premium segment of men's salon whose skills are not upto the mark.
good and fast service.. liked it
Worst ever service....better dnt opt their services....their technicians r not professionals
UC's autoassist always surprise you with better service personnel. never had any complaint!!
Very bad service, I booked 2 days before but till now professional is not assigned. And they are asking me to cancel or reschedule .I have facedcthis kind of issue already. Not sure why thexslots are present to select if they don't have professional
superb
Excellent work
Pathetic service!! Booked some service one day in advance and they couldn't even assign a professional in time. My first time UC experience is so bad that I might not even use it in future.
Delay in service
As on date it's fine
So I booked a service for installation of AC in October in chennai. Then the service guy named Mr Vinoth kumar. The guys installed and assured that everything is checked and is fine. Then due to winters, We hardly used the ac once. Then summers came, we on the ac, to our surprise no cooling at all. We called Vinoth, he dnt came, then sent someone else, and he checks and tell us indoor unit is damaged and gas has leaked. Booked for resolution and Mr hemant from call center, kept crying warranty..
I was supposed to receive a call back for a query in 15 mins, which came 2 hours later in the middle of the service. The UC supervisor kept calling my professional and interrupting her in the middle of my massage to ask her to confirm other bookings. You guys need to get a better system in place. The professional herself did a great job but my experience was less pleasant because of Urban Company's inefficiency.
Professionals not upto the mark.... customer support service is very slow
Amezing üëçüëåüòä
very polite and efficiently
really good service üôèüôè
Worst experience I had placed my first order and also availed plus membership, but the professional delayed the service by 1.5 hours and later didn't turn up. Also, I raised complaint, and the app showed that I will be getting a call from support in 15 mins, but even after 30 mins, no support call received.
very good
awesome app and it's quite useful. love it.
The most terrible experience anyone can ever have. If you value your money DO NOT MAKE A BOOKING WITH URBAN COMPANY. After making a booking and paying upfront the Carpenter assigned Mr. SHAFIQUE KHAN refused the booking 20 minutes prior to the appointment time because he got a more lucrative job in his previous appointment. He directly said that he did not mind if I complained to the company meaning he does not fear any kind of action from it. The customer support is ofcourse useless.
No place to add referral code I received
If you dont have enough men power than why you offer service in raipur. Total waste of time. I will never take service from urban now and also discourage other.
Professional service for an old split ac.
super unprofessional...they call last min to cancel an appoitement saying the location cant be accessed though i have been using the service since ling time..they leave me with no options!!!
Punctual and perfect service
Though the services are good but when it comes to cleanliness urban company lacks it. I experienced this almost 3 times now, after my waxing services are completed there are always wax drops left on either floor or sofa even after using sheets to cover the area and i have to scrape it after the beautician leaves...sometimes the stains won't go. Its really hurts to see this kind of behaviour.
It's an good experience üëçüèª
Service is very good
Wast of Money and time because Service provide self cancel your service my service time 11.30 am but I call service provider 11.26 am and he says your service cancel and if you Service again then pay again because your allready and i cancel your service
Nice AC Services
Worst experience. Booked a service for full home cleaning two days in advance and they claim that no professional is available on the date when I was anticipating the professional to be assigned. Worst ever experience. Will.never book another service in this.. worst response as well. Totally disappointed
On time agent will not arrive finally they will say agent is not available wasting our valuable time by waiting for agent.Worst and too worst customer care service. Customer care executive not even take the escalation to management level. Very bad service.
vv good
nice team
Very Bed service
I have faced many issue after booking
Expansive
Never trust Urban' AC service. There people are falsifying the gas readings. Also the customer support is pathetic. They claim to have warranty and 10000 rs insurance but don't do anything in case of their issues.
A trusted company. Please include hob servicing (gas burner) under your catalogue which was already conveyed to one of your representatives during telecon.
The Rs 0 charge free video call is a hoax , what video call service person advised was exactly opposite what the service engineer suggested after just seeing the tv. Just to charge fees the survice engineer was sent. Repair estimate of just cable repair as suggested by video person was not in written estimate. Will not suggest this app to any friends
fantastic .very impressive
Professional Service
excellent service.. very happy
Everything went on nicely. Very punctual, systematic work, disciplined and well behaved staff.
Do not understand the AC service staff. Every year when I get the service done, they tell me all my ACs gas has leaked. They refill and charge for it. How is it possible that every time gas leaks and these people are not able to identify the problem ever
My first experience with bathroom cleaning is very bad..i booked for intense cleaning..but very bad service was given.
Membership purchased worth 299/- First service too much costly (200 ki service 683 me) Second service = bad experience, no professional allotted, app said trying hard to find any professional ( happens thrice in a row) Very bad experience, not recommend to anyone, soch samaj k download kro iss app ko hm to fass gye No customer care service jaha aap compalin ya call kr skte ho
I have booked the pest control on 9:30 but than on that day it came that you have to book on Monday this so ridiculous!
App needs serious improvement. Accidentally slided my finger across the cancel button and I had to pay 10 dollars cancellation fee for nothing! There is no prompt or whatsoever to ask user to confirm the cancellation. No submit button after typing the feedback.
Salon experience is very unsatisfactory
I have booked an ac servicing.,after serving ac problems are increased not cooling... Don't book for ac servicing you lost your money and time
Best uc service
It's very useful and prompt services.
Very bad 1st experience with service. Book for ac installation.. Unprofessional guys came make dirt everywhere at home. Ac also not serviced properly. Sound in fan and not proper cooling.
Excellent service
Very bad UI usability wise. Where does my cart disappear when I'm trying to select multiple services? Should be more easy to navigate.
Experience was good
Package description is not proper. it takes lot of time to select a package.
Excellent service for UC professional
Supar dupar app all problems all salutions
Thanks UC!
goog services
Excellent service
Very good
It charged for some Plus Membership which I had no idea about!!!!
We are regular customers, but many of their contractors OVERCHARGE AND CHEAT customers and service employees are very slow to respond. One just hung up in the middle of a call! Time to move on to other platforms. Theyve become WORSE since they started calling themselves a company! App is a waste as they do not call you back.
On 9th March, 2022, Booked repair of Split AC. Visited 2 service provider for same and failed to do needful and arranged a Mechanic from local market with out my knowledge. Complaint registered with UC, but no response from them. Matter of reliability, safety, price, risk so please request to everyone for future orders to UC. This is a standard response, Complaint is already registered UC. I was supposed to contact with in 15 minutes. Thanks
Bas kuch hi jagah par yeh services provide kar rahi he..
Excellent service by the termite control team
good headache free service
Very bad experience in Patna. Don't use this service. They are making fools out of customers. Bloody harresing experiences.
Though the service being provided and usability of App is good, but it doesnt have any option to directly connecting to customer care, in case of any issues like when the service personnel isn't on time or isn't reachable.
Absolutely useless service now. Booking was done 3 hours back and no professional is available with them. Payment deducted and will be refunded within 7 days. Absolutely useless.
Not clean properly üòí my bathroom.
Great Services
I have insured my AC under appliance protection plan but it is not reflecting in the app. I am not getting ANY help from the helpline and call back requests are ignored. the premium paid under appliance protection plan should reflect in the app. please do needful. I am waiting for a call
Very poor service by urban company
good work
excellent service
They dnt have professionals
Good
These people charge unnecessarily. Book your local electricians.
Good service. Good app.very useful.
Good
We are not satisfied
Satisfied with the service
Very overpriced for simple things...don't go for.it
I had a bas experience with the service ans even though the warrant is stull active, urban company is not sensing anyone to have a look at the issue
nice work
Satisfaction
good work done
Very good AC service
Awful experience with pest control. We cleaned the entire kitchen and then the professional never showed up. There's no way to contact their support center either
Worst company I had ever seen. They don't hire professional but tied up with local vendor and local vendor don't know how to get work done. They ruined my painting work in home. Whatever consultant suggested we paid but on ground reality they send us professional who worst painted it. Even customer care is worst they don't value feedback provided by customer.
nice work
Gr8 App & Service
good
The worst possible experience with the customer service, The technician won't come there is no response from either sides and the technician already rescheduled the date once and now even after 3 hrs of waiting there is no response to any complaints given. Edit: now to cancel I'm expected to pay a cancellation fee of 50 Rs
Very professional
Excellent, professional service provider.
Extremely unprofessional professionals and charges unbelievable high.
very good but slightly overpriced
Great service!

Good work on time neat and clean work excellent work

Sometimes it feels like unnecessary increase cost from 500 rs to 3000 rs saying horrible problems repllace this and that etc
Thanks uc given me nice service
VERY GOOD SERVICE AND VERY GOOD EMPLOYEE FOR MR. KRISHNADAS. NEATLY CLEAN TOILET AND EXHAUST FAN ,I TEL PLEASE KEEP SAME EFFORTS THIS COMPANY SERVICE OK. THANK YOU
Very poor experience.Technician cancelled the booking as per his wish, no support received till now from Support Team. Moreover its a prepaid service.I dont know whether they have even refunded the money.In no way a customer can reach out to customer support.
They did not repair anything but took the service charge, very bad
Booked for body massage professional damaged our mattress with oil even after telling him we will provide space he denied and did on our bed. He tried to blame us there is no space where our house is 1180sqft having full space he didn't want to wait and told that can proceed on our bed. Representatives are not responsible and marks issue as resolved. Respresentives are very rude
Good, quick and reasonable services
When tried to book a ac service everytime get an error that all technicians are busy we will notify once available but never got the update on this, it is been 4 5 times but still getting the same error, it is better to book a local technician than wasting time here on this app I would have given 0 stars if that was available kindly resolved this issue on priority.

Domestic Solutions through one app. Ultimate job in collaborating all in one.
Tried booking twice to urban company They say professional will be assigned in 60 min nd we get contacted Both times...there was nobody assigned and I had to follow up again and again for update Worst experience!!!
Exceptionally Good Service. Their professionals are very knowledgeable and polite person.
thank you so much
The professionals is not at all professional. They declined the service and asked me to pay more. No way to reach customer support and their incoming calls are going blank. I rescheduled the booking and didn't assign a professional. I booked 6 days in advance and yet they were not able to provide it. SO PATHETIC.
totally worth it
good and neat service by Rajesh
Excellent service.
Moda la company
Very satisfied with the quality of service provided by the professional today. Keep up the good work.
nice
Ac service person refuses to come in next 2 days,booked for saturday as it is holiday but person says will come on monday, I have already made payment for the same Most pathetic service,Ask for any local person but dont book from urban compaby
This app is for people who know to speak Hindi. I'm from Bangalore and the professional getting assigned doesn't know any language other than Hindi. They don't know to speak local language Kannada even. Highly disappointed and uninstalling app.
Customer is not getting options to select their slots & directly they display message in screen all executives are busy.
Excellent service
I am plus member, we have requested for salon service and Professional assigned. Professional didn't come for salon service and not even answering the call. We tried to connect to customer care and they didn't help us in resolving the issue. This is happening multiple times. Even we cannot directly call to the customer care.
very good services my husband is very happy üòä
Been trying to book a cleaning service but says "no professionals available" for 3 days now. Doesnt have any option of scheduling a slot either. Couldn't find any customer care number to call as well. Giving up on the app now and Uninstalling it. Real bad experience. who ever owns urban company, u have alot of work to do at your end.
slightly over charged but good quality work
Bad bad experience for lock repair. I booked and got a guy name Navneet Pandey. This guy had no expertise replace a new godrej lock and locked the door permanently. Urban company not taking any warranty or liability responsibility . Most likely door has to be broken just a 300 rupee work will cost me 10000 excluding amount paid to urban company and cost of new godrej door. Their customer care avoids any answers for path forward door is locked for last 4 days.
Best service app
Professional Services
:/. i...,
Good services
Totally unprofessional executive. Even after rescheduling multiple times, still the executive is unreachable. Even tried reaching customer support, no response from them as well. Every time you raise issue, you have to wait 15 mins for their callback and it's not mandatory you will get the call back.
Terrible. No response at all. They don't deserve even one star
Highly satisfied
I booked a person and you changed her withou informing me
Worst ui, and customer experience
Good
Extra charges apply if we reschedule but there is no any action if service provider not on time. Sometime its happen but at least inform us or reschedule as per our suitability.
Persistent in poor service
Good work done
Earlier the App was user friendly, now it seems so many bugs. You can not see details of any job. There is no way to reach customer care. You click on any button, it will take you to home page. Overall pathetic and frustrating if you really have some queries and want to see the details which doesn't work, and top of that you even can not reach their customer service.
NAAM BADE DARSHAN CHOTE WALA KAAM HAI
Executive forcing to cancel my order without giving proper guidelines regarding new address change in the app, though I'm a premium member from last 4 years. Very unprofessional and rude response even beautician was convinced to provide service to my new address customer executive was manipulating me to cancel my order by myself saying silly reasons
Why UC charging conveyance charge after covid and not any precautions taken only mask. I think they need to stop charging unwanted charges...
Good app
bcz the person charged more

Worst experience..booked for split ac installation and Urban Company sent "experts" without drilling machine. WTH. Their experts were saying to reschedule the booking as they didn't bring drilling machine for split ac installation. When I cancelled booking, rs. 50 has been charged for cancellation fee. Really pathetic!!! No care and value of time and money of its customers. Don't go for this.
Fully satisfied service for ac cleaning..
This is just a third class chutia app.. don't book any service a local uneducated person will who will nor solve your problem and but take your money... they will keep saying sorry and your money gone... chutie Log
Awesome services
Really I wish if there is a zero to give you for the unprofessional service
Nice app and service
UC sent me a superb professional! He did a wonderful job!
excellent and efficient technical staff.
How terribly disappointing to be associated with urban company and get treated the way I have. You guys promised me so much at the beginning and as the service begun there is virtually no support from your team. I have been requesting for a call back to resolve my issues since 3 days .... Such a shame to experience this.
good service, you get everything done very easily.
These people are fraud plz be aware specially when you call them for split AC services..
Very bad and unprofessional people talking rude to clients and cutting phone on face Ms.Madhu
good
Although the service I am getting if fine, but I have a serious concern about the customer service. I have raised a ticket and for 2 days i am getting message that CM ia trying to contact me but not successful. And ironically I didn't get any call. You guys nees to check at your end what really you are doing. Don't send false messages to customers.
Pathetic customer service and app overall. Trust me half your bookings will not go through. Worst part is there is no intimation about the same also. Faces this multiple times and i have decided to uninstall UC.
Am giving a single star because I have got no option but to give a single star atleast, a guy called Sashi Kumar who had come to do my hair cut he charged me 700 rs which was not worth paying him and he was so unprofessional there's no shape for my hair now it's like totally uneven! he has done very short i can't even tie my hair ! I request to not to send such unprofessionals and i suggest not to prefer this app for hair cut and for eyebrow because this does change your looks!
did not used foam ,as showed in Ads
Good but area wise services lacks quality and professionalism. In my area in Punawale, I face lot of rescheduling by professionals and they are always late. Rest, application is good
Down the drain. The work wasn't done what was booked for and wasn't completed. And when I booked for a revisit, they send the same technician to right his wrongs. If he didn't know to service it the first time, how is he able to magically learn it the second time? Plain strong arming of the customer by a company that has grown too big for it's boots.
I had booked today at 3pm for cleaning service, at 2.30 I get a call telling that no cleaner is available and would reschedule at 4.30. At 4.00pm I get a call again from UC telling that its been cancelled because cleaner is not available. you guys don't respect customer needs. Last month during the service your cleaner had no idea about cleaning,upon that she had stolen things from my home. We actually thought of raising this issue to DXB police..but we didn't do it.. pathetic & poor service.
Words are less to describe Ritu Singh's efficiency in her work... Totally satisfied by her massage , perfect and accurate pressure, knows the exact pressure points, knows how to stretch and release pain. My pain was much relieved Will book her again I never got this type of amazing massage Was looking for this type of massage for very long Ritu ji is one of the best ‚òÄÔ∏è‚ú®
Provided good and on time service
great üëç
excellent service
Nice
good service
very professional and good attitude employees
The technician didn't show up on time and on cancellation after an hour of wait, I was asked to pay the booking fees.
Nice service massage is very good
They will make you choose slot per their convenience, and nowadays they have even stopped giving service in certain areas without any reason
Very bad experience ,First time booking done than professional not willing to deliver services, talking nonsense on work,absolutely ridiculous, very bad fist experience
This was the first time I used the service and my experience was really good üëç
sarvice parfect
came on time. worked quietly to our satisfaction. courteous staff. would happily recommend them to others.
Worste customer care experience I ever had
Bed service
Never rely on them for expensive appliances repair. Their technician has taken my TV for repair 20days back with no trace except once he called to inform that your screen has been damaged in transit. And pathetic Urban company team are just asking me to keep waiting as they are working on it from last 15days. There is no direct customer care and their on App Help section is good for nothing.
Loved the salon service i used.
Panchual and perfect service
Had horrible experience with customer service...incorrectly charged for no service being done...they are least bothered...
Super Service üëå
So far so good
2 less stars cause it is impossible to get customer support if you have no order placed or if the order is closed. Cannot reach UC for general help.
I have never spoken to such a rude customer care executive.
Poor pest service they looted my money and cockroaches were back in 3 months
Excellent service
very good service.

Smoodh was Very perfect in his work satisfied 5star

Terrible experience , worst of service ,I had booked one electrician on 9th of March for 2 tube lights installation and 1fan instalation , the electrician broken my electronic smart switch board , raised the complaint in 3 days back no body didn't respond till now , calling several time s to their customer care they will say will call u back in 5 mins but they didn't never call u
Good work

Good and on time service. Thank you.
I am very disappointed because of service provided by urban company.I place an order for Kitchen paste control and partner broken slider of kitchen trolley and the result of paste control is pathetic
They're pest control SVC is the worst they call it safe for pets my pets got poisoned inspite of caging them during the pest c..... And the cockroaches are as it is..... The worst ever.... I will be putting about them all over including on all pet grps..... And twitter... You can't even get in touch with them
Unprofessional folks!

I called them for cleaning...they pour acid on tile and whole bathroom mashed up with stains... Very bad experience......
Very bad support from Urban Company. You call these guys for AC service and they will first check the gas and try to up sale you with gas recharge.
Worst service. Their is NO SERVICE at all. They didn't even provided a air conditioner service at all. I have request for service and waited for 24hours. But still NO SERVICE PROFESSIONAL as come to do the service. I have booked the service which I have paid earlier but NO SERVICE provided. DONT GO FOR BOOKING SERVICE & DONT WASTE UR VALUABLE TIME. NOT EVEN A CALL FROM CUSTOMER CARE FOR THEIR DELAY. IM GOING TO COMPLAIN CONSUMER REDRESSAL FORUM AGAINST THEIR WORST SERVICE.
Worst after service all working executives are totally unprofessional, wasting time ,useless.
They do not train their staff anymore. I've had such a terrible experience with their chefs in recent times. Support is also broken, hard to get in touch with the team. UC needs to fix their policies asap.
Terrible service. Sofas spoiled. Customer care not responding since a week. No one is taking responsibility.
Good
Bakwas company and bakwas service, They all are cheaper and cheater for all customers.
Unable to Remove products from cart
Worst service, I booked for geyser service Then mechanic came and took 3000 rupees repaired something and went. After 2 days it started leakage then i booked revisit then again mechanic came and this time he broke whole geyser and left. Even support is also worst. They said they will send same mechanic to fix it but it was almost 6 months nobody came. Even though there is any repairs i don't contact urban company. Again I am saying it's worst service.
ok
There should be one dedicated phone number to call and get information in the beginning. Otherwise service staff is professional and adhere to allotted timings. App is good.
Perfect for all
Ewwwwwwwwww worse, worst company ever, even the trainer is worst. rose and Rupali first respect the people don't even have a manners to speak, literally Rupali and rose do respect and if I saw u doing again I will going to call police ........rose and Rupali worst I don't even want to give one star cheap people
I m new user.....give me first refferal prize
Worst service one of the teacher rupali in shine mumbai branch her behaviour is like she is the owner of urban clap. Please üôè tell her to first learn humanity how to behave with students. What she will teach to students if she doesn't have manner.
It is automatically adds Tips to services. Even when you dont want to. I cant seem to get rid of this option..i tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Doesnt work. I am paying unnecessary tips
Only Floor and tiles with fan were cleaned .But what about walls n ceiling?
Using since October 2021, no single complain from my side.. Best home salon for Women's as they yet to start mens services at Aurangabad location. I have took 5 services till now

Terrible service....booked ac service and they send an untrained and irresponsible person..he didnt even know how to open splitt ac for cleaning.He took almost 3.5hrs in one ac service and company just said sorry to us...waste of money and time.Never going to take service again from urban company.I'm giving 0 stars.
Very bad app üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°

If we reschedule more than once that's a problem but when your representatives don't turn up for the appointment that's fine?. Last minute they backout. Service was to start at 7.30 getting a message at 8.15 that met with a bike accident. Very standard excuse at Urbanclap.
Our main issue is with how your company handled my problem and the lies spread by you. I have raised my issue many times with you but you never tried to resolve it. Instead you told the service professional that we will quarrel with her and may not pay the full amount after the job was done. This is extremely wrong on your part. You guys tell that the professional could not be assigned just at the appointed time. And there is no way to contact your customer service guys.
no.1 cleaning
Happy with the service
Good behaviour,skilled& calm in nature.
The RO acquaguard servicing and AMC benefits are not good at all. Vendors cheat customers.
superb service, very polite, humble ,did a wonderful job,very honest with his work ,keep up the good work.
excellent job
My previous ceiling fan cleaning booking not completed and Rs 40 is charged
Best app‚ù§Ô∏è
nice l
Poor area coverage
Definitely people can trust Urban Company. Maintained aa hygenic norms in this situation.
Very sad. They are not on time.
Bestüëç
Fraud
I booked first time to check my washing machine . technicians arrived and was good behaved and gave good suggestion.next time I booked technician for freeze repair .he arrived gave correct diagnosis and and repair well and solve the problem.i think they are better than local technicians who are not trained and use low quality parts .I paid the charge online as it is safe and proof of payment.
No standard, quality of work is poor
The prices of carpentry drill and hang kindof services are too high.The cleaning services of bathroom ,kitchen are also not worth .I think urban clap ,should rethink the prices Urbanclap did not follow the prices in their own rate card on the app.
Not at all the slot is booking idiotic app
Amazing servicesü•∞ü•∞feeling safe nd hygienic ...
They cancel bookings without any prior intimation. Even when you have booked 2 days in advance.
cleaning was good and satisfied
Worst service cheating customers to fraud app
Good experience
Very expensive. Stupid & high service charges being added.
Exlint
Very knowledgeable service engineer,thank you
Prompt and hassle free service. Got a small cupboard from IKEA installed. True professionals.
Cheating with unprofessional people....They don't what is air conditioner.....But these stupid sending for soap bath....
Had very bad experiences twice, when I asked the same cleaners they never came again and when I clearly said never again those cleaners, guess what ? They came again !!! They threw away things that shouldn't, and nobody helped us or redeemed us. Also, every time they were late ! Shame on this app. Never ever again
Great services
good service
Poorest service..no professional
Horrible processes. No way of reaching out to any help desk directly. They fail to deliver the service and then levy cancelation charges after canceling from their end
the service was great... without hassle and to the point perfect..
I booked for washroom cleaning service,he left the service without finishing it. Very unprofessional he even fought with us.need call nack from UC team. Bhut kharab service hai,mera kaam bhi complete nhi hua its was a prepaid service. Worst experience
Thanks... a skilled network of processional service providers
helps individual to find right services
Very bad.
Good.
I'm an Urban company pro member. I ordered several cleaning service for my house as I was planning to bring my new born home from hospital and they made fake promises by rescheduling it multiple times ( 3 times) I asked them to be open if it wasn't possible so that I could make other arrangements. I was promised and got a call 1 hour later than the scheduled time that it has to be rescheduled. They wasted 3 days of mine by making me stay at home. Pathetic service. I regret buying the pro members
After taking plus membership I am not unable to book the slots for haircut for the same address and when I am checking the slots from other registered number I see the slots are available. I regret taking plus membership.
Service not available in my Town ..waste of data
Thanks Savitha for being on time even though it's really early. I'm so grateful you're able to complete the makeup within such a short time ‚Äì most importantly, I look really good too!You're so calm even under the pressures of time ‚Äì this shows how professional and skilled you are.Thanks again..
I am living in Anand so can you service
Extremely great
Very Very helpful and user friendly app. Great service provided. Fantastic experience.
Amazing user interface...nice service...
They will not provide any sorts of refunds for their mishandling and miscommunications between support and professionals. Highly unreliable customer support (Mr. Yatharth and Mr. Manish are two such customer support executives) If you end up having a bad experience then you are on your own.
Good service
Very very poor service! Your number doesn't work! You don't call back, really really bad experience. Never going to use Urban Clap again and I urge other people too to never use it.
Split A.C service done
She did really well and very neatly and was very polite
best app i am using m very satisfied
Very good
Ur mssg says that I have been offered free facial,, but when I try to book no such discount is given.. pls don't do this, b clear in ur mssg and policy.
No response about any service and no clarification about service. No contact number for help in problem issues. How to manage any problem with customer service person.
very very good
Fantastic job done
excellent service
overall good experience in reasonable rates
Urban company is proving to be the best service provider. No complaints
Excellent job done on AC
They are sharing customers phone number with other vendors without customer consent. I just booked a hair cutting service and within 30 mins got a call from pest control service. On asking the person that from where he got my number he said urban company which I was already suspecting.
awesome Service
Horrible. Plumber could not fix a tap washer leak issue. Even today the same issue. He has visited 4 times and still no resolution. UC support stated to cancel this booking and they will give a refund, suggest me to raise a new ticket. It's highly unprofessional of the company to do this instead of reassigning a new plumber to resolve the issue. Sometimes I doubt the professionals u send and their quality of work .. my experience is horrible
Not able to find any contact number to escalate our grievances... Ridiculous...
App keeps shutting down.
Punctuality and good service is the true value of time, and I got both from UC and their skillfull Technician Mr. Jitendra Pal.
urban company very useful, they give all services, all services are good
I booked service lost week. They forced me to pay online but I also paid online but it did not become my service booking. So I complained not responding so I did not get my money back. Which is totally disappointing I am completely cheated in this company. Please do not pay anyone online they took my money but my booking was not showing. They are cheating in the name of giving discounts. They are cheating. You know, I will never get my money back. Very Nestle company very very bad experienc
Pathetic service, I have booked a service for my kitchen and urban clap professional refused to provide his services. Urban clap is worst company I've seen so far. Ridiculous service
unprofessional behavior of customer Care
Great service
My experience is very good with UC , there are few glitches in the app on payment front , like Amazon pay offer but no option to pay through Amazon pay balance , you will find it difficult to add your credit card as even after adding details of credit card app doesn't save yr credit card details and you can't pay through credit card. Rest as far as service is concerned I am very happy with the service and professional behaviour of the UC.
When professionals are not available you should shut down your services. Please allocate professionals as partner and then run your service. Very sorry to say this. To All, please be prepared for the Worst if trying Urban Company.
Excellent service by wonderful team members...
Excellent
Pathetic service provider. I am a AC technician professional in this company. the helpline persons don't even consider about their own company working partners . then how come they hear about customers queries and problems . They loot money from customer as a service provider and one third money as a commission from our hard-earned money .
little over priced
So far so good.
Fraud
Rates are extremely high.
Flat 250 off was showing today but at the time of payment the coupon is not applicable and then your customer care number is also not answering
Please enable all services in my location. You are only serving some of the services and they are delaying also to be finished properly... please resolve the issue üôèüèæ üòë

Good job
good service
Worst service don't book waste of time
Dont use this!!! Terrible company. Their 12h PCR test took over 18h, lost my flight. They cancelled my cleaning appointments several times without without any prior time and tried to reschedule for the next day....
Excellent services
Why No GPAY available in payment options if paying after service....While it's available if payment done b4 service.....One chooses this option only bcoz all services are not listed... makes no sense at all....why shld I lose on cash backs available thru GPay..
Good service.
Worse services and cheating by uban company. Don't use this service unless you have extra money to burn multiple times in the name of services or repair.
SUPERB SERVICE
100%satisfied. Neat and clean service....I will highly recommend this service to ALL.üôÇKeep up the good work Guys...üëçüèª
Extremely unprofessional service
Skilled technicians. Bit higher price.
good üëç
Its really a very nice platform for all our routine and even smaller repairs. They provide standard quotations and no hidden charges. Nice to have such platform.
I sincerely suggest not to rely on this app for any customer support in case of any issue after repair.
Relaxing experience
Very bad service
my first experience was good...I would like to use this further...
Booked plumber, I told the plumber due to marriage of my son i need water urgently, told him to complete the job on priority, he demanded 4000/- to give conne tion from submercible pump to supply line. About 9 feet distance, I requed to charge as per company rates, but he didn't agree. After completion I told him to declare correct amount to company or I will complaint,job was not more than 1000/-, but he charged four times, be careful never disclose urgency will fleece you.co.useless co,
Spa service is ver very bad. I had booked head to toe spa. Head massage is given only 10 mins wheras its charged for20 mins. They don't carry enough oil. Urban company send professional who is not willing to work. Daksha is very unprofessional. She was forcing me to cancel my booking saying urban company is forcing her to provide the service. Even though head massage time is 20 mins she said she will give massage for 10 mins and behaved very rudely. UC is Very UNPROFESSIONAL.
Have issue but still not yet responded
I had to book twice the same order bcoz the first said he wouldn't be available at that time...
thank you for provide good service with good quality
good services
Very Bad service, Never Buy 1 Year Subscription because after 1 service they'll not provide you remain services
I had booked a skin whitening facial and she got a gold facial kit. It just does not make sense. Why has URBAN company bcm the worst experience?! There is a problem in every god damn booking! Why can't things be kept simple and hassle free? What is the use of booking a service well in advance to ultimately not get it. Disgusted with the app. Also, biiiiig mistake of buying the plus membership. 299 wasted and how! Never using ur services or recommending them to anyone!
Chor company
good job
Good service as per demand.
good
Bakwaas
Worst service... since 25 days no rework done
UC is now no more customer centric service provider which it used to be. 4k spent on AC service and repair and with use of only 1 month it got me same issue. Unfortunately it was winter so could not be updated of AC condition and the warranty expired and I was only 2 days late. But it is okay that it was my misfortune, but the repair didn't last for one month. UC is now profit making company, so if any haftey amount is estimated then don't have it done by UC.
Nice app. I had a flawless experience with its working and a great job done in the AC cleaning service.
very good service
AC technician came and he dameged the Ac blower, after 15 days of conversation with almost 10 different customer care executive they came up with nothing. Prefer local technician over this non professional workers. Pathetic experience.
The servicer has reached to te wrong address
a little too pricey
Services are good
Professional work.
Mayur.... Good experience

Great service
Good service üëç and satisfied for the outcome
I opted for Luxe salon service, the professional cheated and used local products instead of luxury products I had paid for. The professional was 25min late and rushed through the service. I have raised the issue to help center and they have done nothing as yet. I feel completely cheated and have asked for refund for the facial service. Sadly, I don't why are they thinking over it so much. I have sent the picture too of product used. The professional did not have sealed facial kit.
I booked several times but no slots available
This app is user friendly and at ease to use. I feel more cleaning options could be added like car wash , fish tank cleaning etc .
Not good
I'm a plus member but in this app they made sure that its should be very difficult to connect with customer support. I wanted to complaint about the practices made by their service partners. The guy visited to our home forced me to give 5 star infront of him. (Infact he only selected the 5 star option). This shows how UC train their guys.
working speed and clea
nice work
Service not available. You say ur service is available in Dubai etc but not in India. First cover India and than focus on Dubai. Sick
Excellent
satisfied with your company
smart working. & keeping Punctuality also
We Booked a Intense Toilet Cleaning on Mar 07 with WC + Sink extra. The App does not disclose that Shower Area is excluded. No option for Shower area or Bathtub (which are standard in all bathrooms over last decades) in the App. Service Personnel said Shower area is excluded. He was told that App or Website has no such info or option. He showed something on his phone where shower & bathtub is extra option. My App was version as on 22-02-22. This pack is suited only for '50s toilets! Be careful!
The AC foam cleaning is a joke, the ac technician from UC who came said that this was only for adv
Good Service
Impressive service received by UC, well done by technician, he taken precautions for safety. Highly recommended services üëç
Nice service
I am unable to apply the coupon
Third class application and customer care support, infact you can't approach to customer care directly thru any mode...I registered skin care 5 sessions booking now when I book it for the second ..it is asking for new booking...for this problem it's support is working from last 30 days ..shows how incompetent they are in this competitive world...would suggest to go with others else you won't get support here if anything goes wrong with UC.
Worst service partner, they damaged your stuff while cleaning when we complaint they say it was from earlier so we can't fix it or refund for that. And coustomer care team wow such a beautiful team after registering a complaint for the 1time they call us later never give any kind of update, we should only follow up and get updates. They never trust coustomer words they go through only partner words only. NO VALUE FOR COUSTOMER
Excellent
Nice app
hassle-free, good service
Can you believe there company doesn't have a direct helpline.Their technicians can misbehave with you and what you can do in return is write a mail.Pathetic to the core
Good service üëçüëçüëç
While the services are good the problem is with the app interface itself. Most of the time, links within app don't open and we get broken link messages. Sometimes discount codes displayed when used will show " coupon expired' even 8f the due date is a while away. My biggest grouse is, almost impossible to find a link which will give me an email address or open a chat box so that I can get concerns NOT covered in the FAQ answered. The interface, is not user friendly
Urban company don't have any contact number for further inquiries
We have booked a video consultation for washing machine drain leakage problem.It was good and the assigned professional resolved the issue to our satisfaction.Thank u UC.
No communication between professionals and staff / customer care people. Had a very bad experienced recently - service was cancelled by professional without informing me, and wen I asked for other professional and time slot whatever is available for that particular day , they simply say sorry and end your call.Not at all professional nor it is customer centric
Worst service ever! Just unprofessional stuffs, whenever I book any of the service no one is assigned for the service.
She is very skilled. I would like her to visit me always for the same service.üëçüëåüëçüëåüëçüëå Had a good time.Thanks.
Pathetic services.. were Good Last year
Booked for ac repair and the technician came and opened up the dust net and said it's not repairable and i have to change the entire copper coil total amount around 9k (he didn't even open the machine to check for the leak) then he said I can repair but won't be responsible for another leak (urban company gives 60days warrenty) calling customer care they said we will provide if he repairs it yet the technician denied to repair..in the end i am still waiting for the visiting charges refund.
Only problem is no slot available it is showing since three days. Rashid Ali explanation is excellent.
Dont go UC paints, they hv unproffessionals like Patel Developers who are working worst than inexperincedlocal painter UC takes no responsibility for these cheaters Worst part is, they expect us to give them direct work bypassing urban clap, coudnt complete work on time, last day, they left work incmplet, i thought they will come back to funish but after i gave the otp finish, then Patels didnt take it seriously, walls are now looking bad than earlier, my mistake UC cust service is very bad
Very very waist app and service.only tp
Good Work
Wet service for AC is very good and very professional behaviour of service men compared to Voltas servicing. They did job as per company instructions and no short cuts at all .
They only market according to festivals but no actual discount is given. Usually, the waxing service is at 349 and now they say upto 40% off on occasion of valentine's day and still keep the same rates. They just put it on their app and ads and dont actually change the price.
Terrible experience, the fridge mechanic has run away with fridge parts and Rs 5000/- advance and nobody from Urban Company is responding. Last 4 days have been trying to resolve the issue but no response. Don't trust their mechanics and no system in the app to raise such issues. Even the resolution team has failed, they told they will comeback in few minutes and its been hours since I spoke to them.
The best in market
Help full
Too expensive for Carpenter work.
Too gud !!
nice
worst service ever,they booked my service twice and never fulfilled it. I even paid for it. This is highly unprofessional and feels like suing them for fraud
It is not available in our area üòï
I can't be able to login from last 2 days , when ever I want to login with my mobile no. You're app says that "something broke" and I have faced same issue with my another phn so plz fixed this problem asap..
Wrost serive
Not as expected
great service in affordable price
good servicing
They cancel the appointment without telling us. When we really need the they don't show up. Really disappointed as a client.
LOST MONEY, WORST SERVICE, PAYMENT DONE BUT SERVICE NOT OFFERED.. PLEASE AVOID.. not able to contact proffessional and customer support.. Lost my money
No PROFESSIONALS from 3 days and call themselves Urban. My foot!
cleaners are professionL
Anyone Strictly don't go for UC damproofing!!! Which we paid 55k to urban co and they assured 10yrs warranty but everything cracked out with in 4 months, raised ticket Re: [#4374891] after 10days of followup ppl came for visit as an eyewash, told issue ll get resolvedasap but still nothing happened also guys they ll close the ticket stating call not attended for ever time.... its better go for asian paints they are really good in customer service. My frnd has done with them.
bad services scam fraud company
Worst service
nice
Horrible experience with waxing and threading. Yet another bad experience with them. Payment issue and not giving the credits due are their trademark. There should be an option of negative marks
I would rate Urban as 1 star becz of the cost. It is too high comparatively. U guys are using our place,our electricity and also dump the remainings and still charge a lot more than others. Highly disappointed.
You should start blower service with servicing
i am very happy ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
I have had terrible experience. Today the person refused to deliver the service... insists I book a service that is more expensive. Argued and walked off.
Okay so I had posted a review regarding inconvenience and I got a revert and got my solution resolved within 1-2 hour I had booked service hope so it will be good.
I booked and full paid of Rs.1196.00 for my AC service for dated 6/3/2022 and suddenly appointed service man call me and informe taht his closed relative passed away that's why he did not come and request me that I should reschedule the date. Now I have question that if any emergency had with any service man why company sould not provide any another service man. Why I should bear the issue. Not only that till today i.e 08/03/2022 no any another service man come for service nor any recd a call
Good service
Happy with the Service provided by UC
excellent
Please come at Agra
I would like to refer my friends and relatives as the services provided by the company is very good.
super
I had the worst massage , so untrained .... I have severe back pain, because of horrible massage . She was so harsh and was stretching my body so badly. I kept telling her to reduce the pressure. She was horrible. I have to take pain killers .... I didn't get massage to get this back pain . Most horrible service ever. I'm suffering cause of your untrained professional.
I like the service and service person also he is so informative and gave good service also... Worth it... thank you urban company
not getting Amazon pay option, even though there is amazon coupon in offers section please fix this and i vl rate 5 star
In this salon spree the app gets closing again and again . Not even able to complete one transaction
I had worst experience with Urban company on my very first booking. This company is very unprofessional and they have named their workers as professional but actually they are not professional at all. The professional that was assigned toe for bathroom cleaning, didn't contact me on scheduled date and didn't pick up my calls.
Good
I tried pest control service but it's not worked they not tried to solve your problem they said professional is not available and ect.....üòè
Third class service didn't repaired my A/c properly, worst service ever
Most useful application.
Don't trust this urban company they make all false promises first they charge for annual service then when time come to do service they make all false excuse and when tell them that it's their fault they don't accept as say we can't do anything,just making fools everyone don't trust them.
Good and genuine work
Poor service costing too much
it's awesome service üòÄ
These services were brilliant but now you don't provide refrigerator cleaning without adding 2k worth more services. Not fond of this new approach to your business being a customer for almost 3 years.
Video support not working...
First impressions is last impression and basis of that i will give -1 rating. Service guy not reported on time, service quality is not as per their hype given through advertising.
Nice app
Excellent
Today i booked for 1st time and the professional Sonal Jayesh cancelled it without giving any reason. She called me 10 mins before my appointment and she was pretending on call that she cannot hear and she disconnected the call and cancelled the appointment and customer service was so unhelpful they refunded the money when i asked them to arrange another professional for me. They were trying to contact me by giving miss calls thrice and then they closed my complaint. Really unacceptable service.
Good job
Good
Beware.. I lost some stuff after urban team visited and did service.. Urban team doesn't care for customer.. Worst customer service..
I should have read the reviews before taking UC plus membership, not at all good experience being new custome.
good service
Thanks for such a gr8 app
Nice service
Service related information are very general, charging extra after provided the service
Convenient but costly
Booked an appointment today at 3.30 got call from ur side to reschedule
Good work, perfect job as per their commitment in App
Pathetic experience
Nice and neat work.
Excellent
The booking process was easy. Services by the professional were excellent. Just mentioning here that Cred Pay needs to improve as payment errors are common.
Good Service
excellent service
They have taken money for survey then contractor refused to do the painting.also the money not refunded.they are just fooling people be careful no response after so many follow ups.
Very good service
Pathetic app. Mostly the services are cancelled. Dont ever buy the plus/pro membership. Its not refundable and i haven't been assigned a person since 4 bookings
I'm trying to book a carpenter, but there are never any slots available...
Terrible Experience
very good service
First time I have used this application.I fully satisfied with the services and products.Shyamli Kumari (professional) well trained,polite and also punctual.
Urban Company professionals keep changing or rescheduling the time slots as per their whims and fancies. Best part is Urban company support is non existent. The UrbanClap/Urban Company which I trusted in 2018-2020 is not the same one now. Regret taking membership now. Will use offline services irrespective of the cost/charges
Pathetic service by UC. And unprofessional behaviour towards customers. Taken the money online without sending the technician & NOT refunded the money till date. Then just making a fake call to me & telling the amount has been refunded from our end. But the manager jumped in to tell, the refund is not made yet when asked for the acknowledgement of the refund recipt in writing. Would not recommend anyone to pay for the services in advance/during the service, only to pay after taking full services
Poor service, better close down your company
Bad service. No perfect reply ro costumer professional not received call fake promiss
Very poor customer care - there is no coordination between initial reviewer and surveyor - they are expecting me to reconcile the issues - I paid advance to Urban company - looks like money is gone as no one from customer care called me yet - all please watch out
very good and relaxing service üëç
Very good
The ads mentions that Urban Company follows Covid protocol and the person who was assigned for AC service was not fully vaccinated. Pathetic, no protocol followed.
superb app
Very bad experience with urban company
thanks Urban clab
Is very bad company and froud
very good
I have been trying to book AC service which I have already paid for, but they never have professional available. UC called multiple times but they always suggest something which never works.
Very Very bad service by urban company I will not suggest to use urban service
Did excellent job ,&fully satisfied with cleaning
Company neither provide trained professionals nor high level equipments and Material . Which they claimed . Not worth the price they charged . Very very low quality standards of service. Don't know meaning of deep cleaning or basics of cleaning.
great app great service
UC wrong claiming that after purchasing membership we provide top rated professionals, Today i booked ac service and uc send professional of 0 rated.
Very good and prompt.
Excellent
I used your services twice. First time was excellent. The second time your beautician riya sen did not have sanitizer n she did not have proper equipments. Moreover she dumped used cotton etc down my sink resulting in clogged drain. Pls do not employ such beauticians.
Very good sir I'm uc partner
Worst experience in AC repair they charged me with out repairing my unit when I raised the issue cc told they refund but after 2 weeks they did not refund still
Very non professional company to deal with top line company unprofessional call centre without information. And the app have some techinacl issues even call centre accepted it but they want to harrase customers.
Rate need to reduce
Very bad customer service.They are sendi g unprofessionls and after damaging the products they are not even bothering.Not reponding to calls or emails.10,000 insurance is fake.Dont trust urban company.Am the painful customere with their service.I dont want anyone to suffer like me

Bakir hiiii
Service was very good.
very nice and clean service i m very happy for u r home service
The app is glitchy as soon as I select any service, using a one plus Nord , help
Poor service by the so called professionals .... Pathetic customer support ever........ They don't even deserve a single star for the people they have in their team and thats what make them unprofessional.
I am trying to book a service regarding my AC under Appliance Protection Plan but not going thru. It has been more than 24 hrs since my first try. There is no Helpline number which can be dialled and complaint given. Even complaining on the app has not yielded any response. This is not done after paying in advance for the Protection Plan.
Not able to access the app. Its been 4 days not I'm trying to book a sofa cleaning service. And a house cleaning service. The app continously says something went wrong.
Pathetic ever experience.. No one is calling for the complaint raised. Just receiving messages that we tried reaching you but no call comes. It's missed call. I paid 628 for AC service using foam based but somr technician calls me & requested for preponing time for which I said I am out so not possible. Over & above this when I confirm with him AC service details he says " MY COMPANY JUST SHOWS ADD OF FOAM BASED CLEANING, WE DON'T HAVE THAT WITH US. I WILL ASK MY FRIEND"... Very poor.
Suepr fine staff was very polite and professional thanks for valuable service
Best Service always
App is not working since morning. I'm unable to book the services. Kindly resolve it asap
This app is crashing, can't place order for any services. Please fix it!
Very good App I like the app and i am using ut since last 3 yrs, but there is some glich on the application i am trying to open since morning but it is getting closed by itself, please check.
Very gud service and prompt response

I thought Painters of .@urbancompany_UC wd really b equipped with the tools & outfit as shown in its App & adds üòÇ Very disappointed to have paid half a lakh of rupees to it that it asks u to pay in advance. Very unprofessional & below average. If not improved shall share more >
It's crashing all the time. Please fix it asap.

Babita is excellent. Most recommended
My cleaner rejoice was super awesome, hard-working and efficient, she paid attention to detail and worked around my daughters special needs, the other cleaner we had a week ago was also awesome can't say enough about this company and the workers worth ethics, highly recommend.
very good option for everyone one depend on
it's a great app
Services has become pathetic, I'm changing my review to 1 star. From past 3 days they are unable to assign a professional for a pest control. We are working professionals who has taken leave to accommodate their service but they dont understand the priority of this. If they dont have the professionals, they shouldnt have accepted the booking at first place. Will surely uninstall the app in coming days. I would recommend others too, not to avail them.
Air cooler service not available
It is very disappointing. Last 5 months i am trying to book a slot but can't. Always it says all our professionals for this location are busy. We can notify you when available. I don't know that when they will get time for me.
FRAUD COMPANY CHEAT AND SCAM COMPANY THEY CHARGE YOU FOR SUBSCRIPTION AND DONT ALLOW TO BOOK SERVICES AND THEY WONT REFUND DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE THREATENING BEHAVIOUR BY REPS.. BEWARE....
executive dnt turn up most of the time but up till now, its been an easy app to use. Need more options to use my prime membership.
Kindly read this before connecting to this app. I had booked it for cockroach control treatment in the kitchen and they said they'd assign professional 1 hr before the booked time.We had spent hours of time and energy to remove all the utensils from the kitchen and they did not assign any professional even till the time of booking. But the even bigger problem I encountered was they didn't even bother to call back to inform the same let alone apologise.I tried to contact them multiple times still
Didn't receive cash back as promised by UC.service done by the employee was good no issues with that.
Great services with experienced professional
I am trying to book a slot since last week, but I am not able to pay and book it. I didn't expect this from urban company. Very unprofessional.
save timer and good service
Superb!
Got a deep home cleaning by UC for which they charged a premium but the service was utterly disappointing
awesome services
Excellent app to avail online technician services at best prices with top class service.
This has been Helpful for my requirements like plumbing, electricians, beauticians. One stop shop for good experienced people. Some items are costly but most of it I don't mind due to the service and overall experience
Onboard more partners if you cannot provide services for which you charge in advance. Horrible experience 2 weeks in a row, no professional got assigned and executives kept on pushing the time. It won't matter if you have a pro membership or not. Better use local professionals.
Excellent
Requested for professional massager. She didn't come nor she responded to many calls. You should have arrangement for such delays or lack of attitude from professionals. Improvement needed for better quality service
Best professionals upkeeping UC brand value
Wallet option of amazon pay not available
Time slots should be maintained by servicing persons. If getting late , they should inform b4 hand.
URBAN Company is absolutely disgusting.... They are simply pathetic in their service in Gandhinagar, Gujarat... They take electricians from Ahmedabad and have no control over them ... The electricians refuse to do their jobs and URBAN COMPANY does nothing to penalise them or take strict actions against them... Third class service... Below standard..
Very bad service. They give appointment and no body come and no any call for delay or reschedule. Without your permission They cancel my appointment and i receive msg your payment credited after 7 days.
Good
Hi sir Im working from carpenter navi mumbai please contact me
Very well and enjoyed alot
his very good at his work
Very good experience..the experts were so good. And their behaviour was really nice.
Good work like it üëçüëç
Quick response & great service
Very nice service.
it is really worth
professional approach
It was really a bad xperinc... won't recommend to any1.. professionals associated with them are very poor
Beautiful
I've done AC servicing. There was no pre-information from Urban Company to keep things ready for them like ladder/Stool, cloth for cleaning/wiping (Ideally which could be carried by Technician and water (Which is still ok unless you have water supply issues). Water dripping was there which was incomplety cleaned because we didn't have Wiper/Mob The outside unit was cleaned and the water dripped with the dirt was left partially cleaned (I had to do it) Quality was missing in terms of cleanliness
App is quite user friendly, am able to call and message technician easily.
Not satisfied with the service. One customer 4000 rupees fixed price.. Any small service will make it as a big problem and ask money for just checking and inform about the budget of the service..
The cleaning professionals are extremely well trained. They are polite soft-spoken and punctual to their workplace. Loved it üòä
Completely useless service
Very poor service, unprofessional behaviour
try it you will never regret it's the best
DO NOT TAKE SERVICES FROM URBAN COMPANY. They do not have professional people to send for the service. I opted for cleaning of my almost new microwave and that UC representative came and destroyed my microwave completely and since then everyone is calling me and saying it will be taken care of and now they even stopped calling and reverting my query. The best part is the heating element which is damaged and cannot be fixed as per UC technician only and they are not even bothered to do anything.
Need better offers on A/C services like previous year
urban company is charging service which is not logical because already customer is paying for service.
Dear, UC Just keep it up....
Excellent 3
Please send your technician after 15 days to check whether it is functioning properly or not.
super
Excellent services. Highly recommendable.
Very much required for Bangalore. But these days professional are not completing jobs properly. Follow up from urban club is also hopeless. 2022 as well 2 times had to cancel the service because professional did not turn up on time . Asks for 15 mins extension and then delays and no response. I think quality is poor.
more services should be available in Varanasi
excellent service
Charges of the UC are very abnormal now a days...for example -price of bulb Rs. 60 Labour charges Rs 300 & in addition Rs. 39 hyegenic charges .. So for 60 Rs bulb change we need to pay 340 Rs service charge in total and it takes hardly 10 minutes for a professiona to get it donel.... It's too costly for the services we availed... The management must rethink over the pricing issue otherwise the customer like me would stop taking services from this app... Hope someone listening seriously..!!
I booked salon service for the first time and their professional didn't inform that she will not provide the service. Eventually they said we can't provide services just after 1 hour of my booking time. Not going to recommend this for anyone. Pathetic service. It's just showcase that they are just worst company with no customer satisfaction.
best home service
Loved urban clap's ac cleaning service
Good app
Expensive services
Bookings get cancelled for no reason
good
Hopeless service. UC is unethically using system AI to loot money from fellow customers .. their rate card is revealed after service starts and you're left with no option but pay them 299 for visit and 49rs for funding their professionals, so basically UC will only sit and get money for nothing .. pathetic, would never use nor recommend this to anyone
Worst experience
Professional technician.... happy
you should have trak machanism whether worker attended on the time or not
Fraud people. Please do background check of your employees/partner. I have booked for ac deep clean service, and they have purposefully removed the r32 and asked us to pay extra 2500 for refilling it. Stay away from it.
very good service
If I installed the app then book so many time but every time reply was proffetionals are not available in this area , Notify me. How many times notify
Such a pathetic service.. They just take booking & money & then keep rescheduling the booking without asking the customer at their own & ultimately cancel the booking & don't refund the full amount paid by the customer...on top of it there is no customer care number provided ...through disgusting & unprofessional company ..
One Solution for many Problems.
good
Poor experience with the service
good service N Genuine
good
the partner was thoroughly professional
proffesonals are well trained n well mannered.loved the service
very good service provided by urban company with well trained professionals.
everybody has to go for AC service from UC rather than local mechanic.
perfect service,
Good üëç
Whenever I look up the salon spree section, it stops responding. Why did you give such offers if you didn't want us availing them? There was ‚Çπ300 off on waxing on March 4th but due this constant glitch i couldn't avail the offer. It showed that the free waxing offer is upcoming yesterday and today the offer is over? Kindly look into the matter
nice service
very useful and economical
Very unprofessional service from last few bookings. Even I have contacted your customer care numerous times but no use
Urban clap is designed to clap your pocket. They put low prices in the app & when the technician arrives they surcharge you with a trumped up charge. Rascals!!! It's highway robbery!!! If this was the US i would sue this company
Need to improve slots availability
too costly
Service was on time and worker behaviour and work was good.
299 m belch and d ten butt ek h sarvice mili refund my paise
Very professional service
Excellent.
very professional, good work
Poor service
GOOD
satisfactory service
Worst experience one the waste service
After updating app is not working, giving error 'somthing went wrong, pls try again later'.... I hv uninstalled again installed but not yet resolved the problem.
Urban company is not providing solution for long period...they charge you big but unable to provide proper support for long period. Every 6 months, you have to spend big amount again. Technicians are also not experienced. They provide short term solution so that your ac works fine till 90 days after that you again need to rebook and pay again huge amount. Customer support is also not helpful.
lots of improvements done happy to use it
I have used urban service multiple times and I am extremely happy with the service.
Very bed experience from urban side still can't call back and your plumber morning call me and tell me that he come at 9.30 and when I call at 10.30 he told me that I don't come How this type of behaviour 0 rating for Anand prajapati plumber Third class experience from urban side
Very good service done by Urban Company.
Yet UC has to implement on below topic I faced recently... 1. When required replacement and need to procure items with your UC representative, its rate is almost double considering same quality in market. 2. Also invoice is not bifurcated with each item replaced and their rate. 3. No Job number or Invoice number in application for referring. PDF copy of invoice not available on Email even requesting.
some glitches are the, can scroll up and down while selecting type in a particular service
Serve excellent service
Want my ACs serviced
best servicing option is urbanclap....smart work they done
Yes AC cleaning jobb done by you is very good.
Good service
amazing work
Good technicians i like urban company
Unfortunately, even after regularly highlighting issues to their customer care team, the issues do not get resolved. These guys provide a second grade service and charge you more than double the market price. Their services and after sales services are the worst ones available in the market.
very gud experience..it was first tym I called for urban beauty professional. I will recommend my colleagues for the same.Thanku
This company only hire unprofessional and his customers care executives are really don't understand the customers view.
It happened second time when professional didnt come. Urban company is charging 49rs per booking from customers and cheating on the name of training and still sending road side local shop persons for jobs. Urban company must take ownership and pay compensation for delay or not attended jobs. Really pathetic service. Couldn't give zero star as option to give zero star is not there, otherwise service is not even one star.
Awesome
Highly professional
Referral reward and UC credit not working if sign up after 12 am, wasted my 400 UC credit
My a/c not cooling after your service
more flexibility in service combination. better availability of professionals in weekends
Very unprofessional attitude
üëç
Good urban company üëçüëçüëçüëç
Hopeless experience
My experience is great especially with Mrs Sudipa Guha. Everyone in the party appreciated me and moreover I couldn't recognize myself. But I just have one concern, I wanted to give good reviews and rating to her but my payment was not updated on time and review window got closed. But in general, urban company is a great help during this pandemic time.
Professionals who work very well. Satisfied.
Professional services
People were not well trained, some were impolite and classic home cleaning service was not as mentioned in the app. I wouldn't suggest anyone for the classic home clean.. i think the premium and platinum services would be little better even if It is costly..bathroom cleaning was not good and also these people forgot to get the required chemicals for cleaning.. finally the service was not up to the mark. It can be improved. One last suggestion keep an eye on them while cleaning for good result.
excellent service
very good
If there are technical issues in refund, its fault from your side, its been over one year and still I have not got refund, atleast would have refunded in ucwallet. Worst app ever
Worst experience, it is the most disgusting, ridiculous and waste of time application and service.. Don't go for it..
Worst company and cheat technicians
Worst service.Charged extra for spare parts without bill.charged approx 1000 rs just for repair and changing a small part .However after the long fight got back my money.Never recommend anyone
Amazing experience
great
Good
Have been using Urban Clap for last 2 years, it's excellent service and quality of work has enhanced over time. Rates are also very competitive and pocket friendly compared to local vendors. Highly recommended....
Makes life much easier....thanks
very good
Good service üëçüòä thaNk you
It is unfortunate to see that Urban service is becoming poor. I did not have any challenges before, until recently Urban is unable to meet the timings and I am tired of listening to their constant apologies. There is a real challenge with Urban team in managing client bookings and transportation of professionals.
Worst service
Good service

Worst service, due to beautician mistake got one of my appointment cancelled without prior consent
very good job done
Service was good except for error on tap replacement while booking
Everytime it is saying professional unavaible at chikhali pune.. time wasted from 4 days. ..
Very nice

Very good,polite,well mannered
excellent
it's an amazing experience with UC .we like this from last 4 years.
Excellent
Even though it is a good application but it cannot ensure the quality and intentions of the Technicians that are linked with them. Some things you get to know only in person.
Swift, reliable and professional experience, Totally recommended
good
Because of inappropriate service I have lost my cash.
Very unprofessional...do not come even after 2 hrs of booked time... Not at all the service expected from a professional team
Extremely satisfied. highly recommended
To slow to solve the problem
Humble service, answers all questions patiently.
Carpenter was sent who did an incomplete job and on raising warranty the person declined to come for work When i escalated this problem with support team. There was no solution provided and had to get my work done by a local carpenter. Uninstalling now.
The professional stole my gold jewellery. The name is "ar.ragini" if i get my jewels back then i will not make this an issue... If no action is taken, you will here from the police.  Don't use this service
Best company
Worst experience ever. The professional did not show up, didn't even answer my calls and I was also charged 500 rupees towards cancellation
he was excellent
Very good services
very good
very professional and neat work
excellent
Fast and efficient cleaning by Uma
The service was perfect
Mr jiten is very nice person,done all his work perfectly I wish him all the best
Company standard daily down to down
Waste of time and money
No service in time.
Much useful
In my perspective, the urban company is overcharging. The business charged 299rs for simply replacing the air conditioner to a fan.
Very professional
Superb concept and app! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
good work
Mai jitni bhi tarif uc....ki karu kam hai humhare bujat me ...ek dm kamal ki service provide ki gyi ...i m so happy koi salon jaane ki problem nhi jb bhi salon jaane ka mn ho ..uc...ko join kar lo ....i m sooooooooo happy üòä...

Unable to complete booking for AC service. The page is stuck on payment option unable to proceed. Kindly advice
pricing is more
Good
excellent service
Good
I am trying to book a slot since from 1 month but it's showing no proffesionals available
They will repeatedly cancel or reschedule your appointment with no prior warning or notification - on the day of the service itself, which means you have no option to book someone else. Mysteriously, their technicians are suddenly on leave on the day of the appointment, and the next appointment is hours later- which effectively means no appointment for the day, because you already planned your day around the now-canceled appointment. They have zero respect for your time.
There are a lot of scams in this application .They show a rate and then say another rate after working .I have used this app four times.The same cheating was done every time.Each time the rating is brought in by the technician who came.Double amount is taken every time they come to do electrical work.Do not actually install this app There are many scams.Work that costs out to a hundred rupees But in the Urban Clap it becomes five hundred.hatsoff urban clap
Unprofessional exceutives Always late I booked for 8 Acs they charged me 3450 I had called the professional at 930 , till 1045 no reporting i cancelled and they still charged me 200 rupees for what for the inconvenience , failed app.
Thorough professionalism by UC's technician
Very good service with Urban clap
very good service.very good nature
Mohd majeed nice boy clean full ac and area my house grill thanks urban company
Worest services
Excellent service
Urban company provides 3 month insurance for service provided but when we claim the Insurance , they donot respond. There is no way to reach UC through phone/email/chat directly
wonderfull hassel free service
good
When the app is installed the battery is draining very fast wrost app don't dwonload the app
It's my first time... Facial service was üëç
Unhappy with house cleaning service
App says there is offer on Amazon pay wallet however when I check out for payment there is no Amazon pay wallet option.
this app is useless app there reply we don't provide services in your area.Don't lie to your customers.at least tell the truth we don't provide services in my areas.One year ago you told me you are increasing the your radius but still you don't provide services in our area.You should be given zero star.
very help full app
Very good a/c service tecnicion on uc.
Worst experience, whenever going to pay, they increase charges. A type of cheater
This not good , on tv this company saying ( AC service ) is under 499/- only , but it's showing 1099 /- , Stop manipulative people üôè
Clean, safe, comfy
It was good experience.
excellent service on time and relaxing
Nice service
I have had a very good experience with Urban Company when I have used their services for bathroom cleaning, kitchen cleaning and haircut. Keep it up UC!
Good service , very professional.
very good
Services are useful but too many spam messages, calls. Hate these spams.
great salon experience at home. Bravo
very nice service
I am satisfied with the service
Nice business app but a lil complicated.
Professionals on salon services. Not so good experience with cleaning services
Worst service employees are beggars asking extra money from customers they delay customers intentionally for extortion they bring unknown unvaccinated unverified people with them UP BIHARI employees are worst
sumaiya banu üëç
Not really professional bathroom cleaners. Not properly trained people. Needs a lot of improvements to call themselves really professional at their job. I for one would not use Urban Company for cleaning purposes around my house or recommend them to my friends.
I booked an appointment for AC Cleaning technician did clean but damaged my powecontrol board due to this outerunit is not working.i asked urbancompany they did not respond.they were not caring my problem even though they giving false reasons due to the voltage fluctuations AC got damaged.if voltage fluctuations was there every thing would have been damaged in my House TV REFRIGERATOR every thing working fine except AC.SO please don't believe damage control they will not give any damage control.
Nice & timely service...
the app is good and service is also good. I am happy with the professional
amazing
I have booked for bathroom cleaning service and paid additional fee for commode stain removing but professional who visit my bathroom cleaning not experience don't have manner how to talk misbehave with me telling me he has done graduate degree worked in abroad and doing bathroom cleaing job what I will do with his degree or have done PhD. I have booked for job he has to perform. Very bad experience with this technician and I will uninstall this app from my mobile n will not book any service
This app is waste whenever I try to book a slot it shows the professional is unavailable in my area.
No option to call and reach the customer care. It's one way ..they only have to call back by themselves which they don't do as promised and customer only has to wait with defective product after paying for multiple times and issues not being resolved.case manager promises to close the issue in 24hrs but doesn't seem to close not even call back. They send technicians who don't know about the job during initial assignment and if they mess up they promise to send expert but expert denies the job
Love the experience and hospitality by UC ppl
very nice service by fatima
Very Good, Excellent
Ye chor he paise le le te he advance aur bad me koi saport nahi Kate
The makeup artist that was assigned for me was, Simran Shaw. Loved her work,did such a natural looking makeup and so fast. Loved her professional approach.
good service

excellent service
Thankyou urban company
very good
Extremely pathetic technicians !! They don't do the work well !! Damaged my Air conditioner in the last service which has led to me needing to face a loss of approx Rs 4000 !!! Don't ever use this company for your appliances atleast
Super ‚ù§Ô∏è sevice by Norkit...love it
Worst services ever. Worst app design . Their professional are canceling the request and charging to customers.
good job done
Don't recommend it at all. isn't user friendly. professionals arent assigned. YES MADAM IS MUCH BETTER ALTERNATIVE THAN URBAN COMPANY. terrible experience. never using it again the future. I wanted to give it a 0 but that's not possible so I give it a 1
she did her job very well...and efficiently...she is polite and maintain hygine level also
overall service was perfact
I loved the service( facial and pedicure by Vidya. she is amazing. I think this is the best facial I ever had. really glad and thankful.ü§©ü§©üôè
One guy came to fix my bed. Gave estimated charge and took money to buy all the materials and disappeared. Not picking calls and it's been 6 days. No help from urban company at all. Absolutely a disaster experience and no customer support from urban company. I dnt recommend urban company to anyone. I am also going to file a complain against urban company and the guy who came as urban company is not providing any solution and I HV to fight for my own money.
Great platform to promote skill india
Regarding the UrbanClap senitization service in Hyderabad, I was really disappointed in the process of disinfection. The professionals in Hyderabad do not use the fogging system, only they spray it with chemicals. Which is not a suitable solution to disinfection. However, UrbanClap in Kolkata location use fogging machine to create a fog in the room for initial disinfection and spraying after initial disinfection. My prior experience is good about disinfection service by urbanclap in kolkata.
it is a great app
Extremely poor no value for someone's time 12 noon appointment from 11.45am person saying coming in 10mins..at 1230 saying coming in 2mins .. 1245 saying still at previous booking.. Even support staff is hopeless calling after 25mins.. They don't value someone's time .. Not reliable. .
Very good
couldn't book multiple categories at the same time. Final amount for a service is very high (other charges, minimum order amount etc)
Got paid pro membership and then company is denying promised 15% discount.. don't buy pro membership.
Urban 2000 rupay test ke leti he or fir bando ko fail krdeti he or pesa fas jata he. Or joining ke ke 25000 leti he partner kya kamalege fir apna hi profit nikal ke compny bando se bhi kamati he
Best app . Have solutions for many daily household prblm. Good membership rates.
This app is good.But the service you provide is very expensive .if you could make the rate of every service affordable then I can think it will be great.
Painting services are not that great. They Need to give proper training to the painters
good service
good
Well mannered and genuine service.
The overall experience was very good. Hastle free appointment booking and the professional beautician. Hygiene was maintained all throughout and equipment used were clean. I loved trying their service
Getting complicated to use this app. Even not able to buy membership having coupon code. Customer service is also not able to solve. There is no customer service number to contact directly. How rediculous it is?
Booked Kitchen cleaning service and they were unable to provide a professional. Asked me to reschedule for the next day and still the professional didnt turn up. Had to cancel the booking. There was no response from UC and they are least bothered about it. Very poor service & attitude. They dont even have a number to escalate and speak to.
Most of the time their service professionals cancel the service giving false reasons. Can't trust them. Pathetic service!!

Unprofessional ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨They are not panchual at all
perfect hair look loved alot and Michael is very good professional
Worst experience
One can't even register on this. You really need to fix this issue
Most disappointing app ever. I book a service only to know that I have to shell out amount more than the device value to get it repaired
Very limited service locations, its unable to read my location being a district place.
Based on all negative reviews I think it's not a good service. Thought of booking for AC service but now dropping.
So a haircut is 249 rupees excluding 49 rupees convenience fees..which is too much..the pricing is ridiculous.
Exceptional service. Punctual.clean and neat. Courteous and professional service
excellent.
will tell next time
Evening after taking uc plus membership i cannot book any slot , and if I book from another number for same location and services, booking slot ia available.
Really awesome app and great services with suitable charges at the home.
Please extend your services in khanna,punjab also
nice responce
Professional service! Well mannered!
Unprofessional
amazing service
Excellent so far in the first month
perfect knowledge & value for money
Unprofessionalism is the word ! Booking is never according to our time, professional reschedules as per their convenience & later cancels the service too. Wherein we plan and do things with our commitments but urban company only gives disappointment. I seek refund for the membership fees which is utter waste of money.
Please also add pc cleaning services it will be very helpful for gamers
Their Technicians/Engineers are highly professional. Do their job precisely. Thank you UC for outstanding services.
Good service
Excellent work ,really happy üëç
price is too high. only to put one L angle charged 268 and one tap 200. this too. high.
very niceüëç
nice
Third class app urban company , professionals are not satisfied to the customer . Only price is to much high ... Beautician are not good for her work..nd cleaning agent also..I m very dispointed ..
always good
very good service. I'm very much impressed. cleaning as well as behaviour of the team is very very good.
good service
very poor service. the technician came for AC service demanded extra money.
Totally recommend
I had my AC servicing done with urban company and had a decent experience . Technician mr.maulana have a decent experience in the trouble shooting and guided the care to be taken.Great job UC
Tried to re install but dint help. Not able to do online payment n not able to book appointment.
very helpful app
very well mannered..good service.. but can't find my hand bracelet after service..
This company is fraud. Firstly their technicians are not trained enough to do their jobs. Their support team is full liers.
Very good company
Easy to get the service's
Very useful app for all services
price of capacitor is too high
the work was perfect
Plumber assigned by UC was pathetic, no experience of work, he has spoiled my wash basin and kitchen. Problem remained unsolved and I wasted my time...
Good app
Awesome
Good Job, Warranty must be for 1 year instead of 3 months
Cheats. Don't deliver services at promised prices and given time. Booked a beautician and they were not able to assign any professional for 2 days and kept on rescheduling and making us wait and ultimately cancelled the booking after 2 days of rescheduling. Waste of time.
good
Poor quality hair professionals with exorbitant pricing and lame customer service. Never book hair cut on this app. They send roadside vendors who aren't trained in haircut professionally and charge 500 bucks. I received a very poor haircut and when I complained the customer support representative was negotiating with me on the amount to refund. He couldn't even give a good support experience. The service is fine for other things like women saloon but not for men's haircut.
ss
Professional was not so professional
Great
Pethectic service i strongly suggest everyone not to book any service from urban company they are not at all professional they either have some other work to do at the slot timing.
On march 2nd I have booked for my split AC deep cleaning service for Rs.649.Your service man Mr.Kasim attended the service.Firstly he demanded Rs.800.After bargaining he agreed to do the service for Rs 700..Thoug you advertised that foem cleaning will be done..this man did only plain water cleaning and demanded Rs.700..After arguement I gave Rs.700..I was cheated by your company man...After that I received a message from your company that my AC service booking was cancelled.I can not understand
have been raising a complaint on the app regarding incomplete service. I get a notice that i will get a call back in 15 min. it's been 24 hrs and neither have I received a call back nor the issue has been resolved.
good seevice at ur door
Yhe most unprofessional app I yave ever used and it happens every time unprofessional, unethical and most non sense app I will make sure none from my family ever uses this app ever if you yyys don't have professional do not confirm the appointment and if you have atleast hire professional people who value time. Most worthless app ever
Worst Customer Service. I wanted an appliance to be repaired and it was pure Waste of time and money. Took 45 days just to tell me that they can't repair it. And I rarely got a call back from customer care when a call request was raised.
Amazing
Wonderful services üëè ‚ù§
Best app for all the in-home servicing needs. Professional technicians and they know their job perfectly.
Showing service not available all the time, don't know why they would show the service If they can't deliver it.
Unable to make payment or select cash after work
Good
Nowadays am facing so many issues for the very 1st time on this app. Sometime your bookings automatically get rescheduled at midnight & sometime you don't get the professional you want to rebook. And the customer support team of urbanclap is just Pathetic. They don't respond & assign you professionals on pre-booked date & time. Now it's high time that I switch to some other options.
good "help in need"
The technicians assigned will force you to give 5 stars eventhough you dont want to. Urban clap technicians have no relevant experience and they are nothing but rogues roaming in the street. These technicians will always try to overcharge you through unnecessary parts change...
Have had a mixed experience overall
very lively experience. professional job well done. well mannered person.
good üëç
high cost
Good work
Disappointed!! It's showing free waxing but when applying code the code isn't working during payment.
Services are satisfactory but prices are on higher side.
When I am tryng to book.. It throughs a blank page from the past 2week onwards, I have marked a mail but there is no good response.
They are providing unprofessional technicians
good service, appreciate
Horrible experience past booking and now its seems they are simply become to big to provide service to their regular customers. Yesterday i had a booking for massage around 6 pm. The therapist reached my house and the booking got cancelled from their end.. She refused to start the therapy.. after speaking to cc ..she started the service which was midocore.. now they are still charging me cancellation fees. For no reason on my next appointment.. No cc for us to call they say but dnt call u back
It's gifted service company to all indians. No one can serve like yours. Keep it up!

Perfect application for house hold repair works... No need to run behind search for professional workers.
I need more services in my location, of course they've improved a lot in the last few months. I couldn't use any of their services in my location a couple months ago but now I'm getting few of them, and I'd definitely give full star if I get to experience all the professionals in my location.
Good service
good service
everything is good but high rate not suitable for....
Spa for women is bad. It doesn't seem like urban company's cares to see if their experts/professionals are really skilled. The person who came is totally unskilled at her work.
for professionals who know their job, for charges that are reasonable, and for fixing the different issues at home, urban company is what I turn to. Really so happy about how I can get my residence maintainence issues solved, at the click of a button!! so convenient!
Very disappointed with the company perse. Trying since last 3 days to book a slot and receiving same reply on app that all professionals are busy for the selected location (Subroto Park) and waiting for the availability notification which looks like a myth to me. Very unprofessional approach. Expected something better than this.
Chote moti jagah bhii available kare jaise Farrukhabad (UP)hame bhii kervani hai
Siliguri no available,
Doesn't have customer care number
Very good App that helps to contact service providers and we do get all type of services at convenience. Generally, the customers are charged by cash for external part purchases. The quality of work is not actually seen in the professional rating because the quality of work can be judged through the durability of the service. The rating is based of quickness to response , behaviour of personnel or the expertise seen at the service. It would be good if we can do rating revision after 6-12 months
I am from Jamshedpur location. Who is the idiot who created kids package. You cannot buy kids hair cut as it 149 and you need to add 50 rs more. And there is no package at the rate of 50. Who is that uneducated person ?
good
Easy to use - lists all the products and pricing upfront - user can choose the service as they wish. Great experience. Recommend to users who wish for easy to use and detailed services. Provides full tracking of swrvices
House Painting Scam by Urban Company I booked painting of one room and Urban Company ruined it in every sense. The professional consultant promised something else and painters delivered something else. Payment is 100% advance hence you cannot ask for refund. Any damages in painting room is not covered by Urban Company Insurance. Worst app and service. Don't use and hire urban company professionals.
moderate experience so far so OK
speed and accuracy service
We hired painters for our new flat painting. They left with lot of patches on the wall. Urban company is providing 1 year warranty but now not entertaining our request within a month. I have raised complaint multiple times but resolution yet. Humble request to readers, please don't trust on urban company for painting.
scheduled a day before but did not respond and had to reschedule
good job
First time i have booked for services and they denied services because of sizes of bathrooms which was not mentioned in the services.very disappointed
Very worst app don't use this
The app is not working properly. Payment options are worst. OTP is not received while booking for wallet link.

Most Irritating service provider. Every other uc person denys for every other service with extremely lame reasons & When u try to reach uc help they answer like they r not accountable for any service denial.
There is no customer care number to contact, I had seen one of urban clap who came for hair cut service has thrown all the hairs in road and lit fire on it took all the dry leaves around it made road and area mess... What irresponsible fellows
excellent work
Good service and understanding persons
Nice work
Exellent... Satisfied
Well trained staff
The worst service ever,waste of time
Urban company is a fraud, you won't get the desired service but still be charged... And please never think of buying the membership that's the worst one can you do. If you want ur appliances to be repaired contact the brand and not the frauds of urban company...... Booked a water purifier service along with membership, then company called saying parts are not available so we can't provide you the required services and cancelling ur request... Refund of 98 rs will be given and remaining will be
excellent
Iam trying to book a slot but Not getting the slot for bathroom cleaning from last 10days..UC should increase the service persons..
Unprofessional, unethical behaviour. My booking was postponed 4 times and I did not get my service. I cancelled the booking and refund takes 7 days.
Not able to book, always saying no slots in this location, though in the past had multiple taks done, and no customer care number to contact directly
I took the membership on 01-03-22, I have booked service request, urban clap accepted the request and scheduled the appointment by 10Am on 01-03-22. But today is 02-03-22, no one attended to resolve the issue till now. If I thought this much time will take to resolve the issue by urban clap , I go for local technican. People don't take the urban clap membership, waste of money. Better to choose alternative.
class
I have had very good experience with Urban Company most of the time, be it for salon/spa services or home cleaning. Mumbai is know for professionalism in all aspects of work and UC is living upto this mark.
India service industry lacks skilled labour and reliability. Hope Urban Company like organizations will overcome this huge lacuna.
This app does not work in nashik... agar aapko service deni hi hai to pehle aap apne worker badhao fir application start kro
Worst service. Unprofessional and racist technicians. No responses from customer care team. Absolute nightmare
Untrained staff of UC and professional
Good
I took ur service this last Sunday. But I was unhappy with executive rushhing work so I reviewed him and now I just got call from that ur executive and threatened me. Said he has my address and coming to meet me tomorrow... My family and me are very scared and frightened... And best part is there is no response from UC. I am going to complaint in police station against UC and ur that executive. How he dare to do such calls to customer... Very much dispointed and shocked... Call me immediately..
Please function in Varanasi as well
Can you start your service in Ahmednagar please
do try urban company for deep cleaning for ur house.. excellent service
Very low price haouskeeping sarvice price nahi purata bad sarvice not satecfaid
Very worst experience..i ordered a deep ac split cleaning but instead got a service of basic cleaning and they charged me for deep clean...if you raise issue with a tickets the customer care also doesn't give you proper answers and instead close the ticket without any solution...don't waste your money with fancy names. Just go with local cleaning
rating for the salon services!
good everything nice service at this cost.. happy ...
Hiii your hiii hiii y
Very good service. üëç
Worst experience
Everything is fine, but... 1. I just wish there was an option of updating or altering address if needed after booking. I understand it makes things difficult for u, but its a rare situation anyway, and 2. the app stops the moment I try to view details of services
Third class company mat ballo Technician bahut bekar hai kam nai atta Jisne bhe achha review diya wo sab une ke Technician hai please mat bolna inke Technician pachtaoge kam nai atta faltu hai
Had availed spa/massage services was satisfied but my booking still shows payment pending ,don't know why as I had already paid before availing service.Tried salon service today,good experience
Worst company, they took a massage booking did not assign any professional. I raise an issue and then after 1/2 they said they cannot assign anyone and won't even refund my membership I purchased with this service. I will never use this app again. They are just charged me for membership even when I wasnt provided the service
good

Very nice and professional service
Very bad experience.not expected this kind of professionals.rude behaviour of staff and deny to provide the service.not to be called again for services.
Very professional and convenient service
Good
You are charging 499 for a visit by technician who will come and tell that display of TV need to ne changed. This was told by local technician already who had not charged a single rupee. How these charges are justified? My mistake that I have subscribed for UC Plus also.
Quick and good service in a short turn around time, so far so good. Also, offering an interesting bouquet of services. Must try!
Excellent job done
poor customer service...can be better
Very poor service and cheating customer.......They show the offer price will booking the service, but the service technician will not have the offer amount, so he will charge the full amount without any discounts got will bookings. If we try to call the customer care they simple say that you have to pay as per the latest invoice generated....
Their professional are highly unpunctual they will accept the booking at will arrive at their own comfort ,it doesn't affect them that the client's time is too precious.
A BIT EXPENSIVE
It s is very dangrous app don't dowload
service is good but charges are so high if u reduce your rates it ll be help full nd good for more people I mean not everyone can handle this much of cost for service 400 or 500 will be ok they charged 650
good
excellent
I wish there was an option to give a 0. UrbanCompany has lost it. My first booking and like others have commented they ditched the appointment because the professional didn't feel like working. Just an hour back he had called me to see if I could avail services sooner. 30 mins before I am asked to reschedule which I politely declined. UrbanCompany you need to sort yourself out. I am not writing emails to your dummy mailbox to resolve anymore. Figure out from the dets here
Happy to have UC services.
reasonable and time efficient
Can plumber check what is the underground status of pipes and reinstall them?Please help
Looting customers now. Just got channel of the screw tightened and cupboard hinge put back. And got charged 500rs for these 2 tasks. Carpenters are good but you guys are following same suite as zomato swiggy charging exorbitant amount for simple services
I have opted for cleanup service..the professionals were awesome..i like the way they did the service....
Good to use
Awosome service excellent service
Positive experience everytime.
DISAPPOINTED BY CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM. NO REPLY ON INSTAGRAM, BY SENDING SO MANY DMs. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A PROPER CUSTOMER CARE NO. THAT THEY'LL CALL BACK. IT'S BEEN 2 DAY'S NO RESPONSE FROM THEIR SIDE.
Very very bad, bad, bad experience, misbehaviour, n threatening of personnel of your company, that pay amounts unofficially I will do work, otherwise I will go, after completion created nuisance for payment, remove n sac that fellow ,we were ready to complain with police reg, very bad experience with your company . Removing your app also
Pethatic app and servicev
Best
Well i have had so far ok to really good experience with urban company. However, my opinion is changing about the services provided in certain parts of the country where safety could be a concern. Also there i noticed there is no contingency plan to back up their services. There is no immediate response to any alram raised which has make me really think twice about the customer safety. I thoroughly request the managment to understand small nuances which can lead to big disasters.

Super urban company
Up to the mark
I like the concept of Frist video call to look at issue and if not possible later expert visit the site....
Not at all happy with the service .....
very user friendly app. one stop shop for many things
The professional assigned to me was inexperienced. So i requested Customer executive to assign me another professional. Yet I have been assigned the same professional and i dont see a way how i can call the customer service.
Professional executives forcing for other services and they saying registered service will not work without suggested services. Raised a help request with customer service but they called 3 times but they cut immediately i lift the call 2 times (i lift the call in less than 10 sec of rings) and reverse i got sms saying i am not connected. Placed 2 reviews before this but they got deleted by app team (it seems) google support suggested me to report on the app.
Worst home sanitization service ever. They charge a boom for a service which you yourselves could have done better. The home sanitization is described as hospital level sanitization as per the app but a person comes n sprays some liquid here n there/on your floor and a leaves after a messed up mopping.
Excellent experience with ease of booking and we'll partnered app
Rates are too high for housekeeping. Middle class can't afford.
My washing machine was running perfectly before the service, now machine is not working. "First service is Worst service" . I am Plus member also. Customer service guys not responding even i called for 14 to 15 times, their saying service guys are not picking the call so wait fr the sollution. Now almost waited for 8 days but still nothing has changed. Please dont go for UC. Think before booking.

Worst service and worst customer service
A very poor experience, the very first time. I did this booking for intense bathroom cleaning. And we are highly disappointed with the service provided. The professional was not at all professional. All he did was spending time inside the locked bathroom doing almost nothing. He expected all stains to go away using machine only. Nobody can find any 'hard' work put in by him. These people don't even have a proper logical criterion for deciding on the count of bathrooms/toilets. I feel cheated.
I don't know why I am unable to download this app in my device. If I am installing another apps its been installed but not this one..
Everything is really good. I always faced issue to contact customer care.
Awesome Service, UC
This person has cleaned the house so neatly. The most amazing part was he even made the water bucket, mug & celing fans look brand new üòÖ.... Urban company service is absolutely amazing. This is the second time we booked a service and must say that it provides good service.

Very good professional services
I have taken thebplane for 2 services but no option is coming for second service booking
Collected more amount
It is good
It was the first time using the lazer service. It was good.
Service is generally okay. But comes with deceptive pricing, where they force us to pay over 30-40% extra after the service, even in case of packages they advertise
The professionals are good, punctual about timings and co operative in nature.. They're good in their jobs, so yeah, Happy with the services received so far!
Excellent service üëçüëç given by UC

Worst service Worst experience think before calling them
I have felt cheated. I requested for re visit. But professional come and told me. My machines problem could not be solved. And promise me to refund the amount which I paid. He cheated me. He's not attending my call. Very very worst experience.
Its really ossam nd help alot in ..try it ..i am happy after using this
good work
nice and prompt service
excellent technician and good in person
The service is not good at all. When I go to book a revisit, the option is unavailable and the customer support number is not shown on the app. My 90 days warranty has expired due to this issue and now I will have to pay 2000 extra for the same issue. Pathetic
I made the booking for six split acs and made the bulk payment ( prepaid) but booking was captured for windows and additional six hundred were charged . Unprofessional behaviour of urban clap. AC technician was excellent. No resolution has been provided , called and asked me to describe the issue, when I told them that I don't have time to discuss further then asking me that will refund your 600 inr...this is not about money refund, it's about unprofessional behaviour since I made the review
Vary nice
Please read this before installing this app. I booked an appointment for cleaning, the professional did the cleaning but broken the geezer pipe, due to which the water is leaking continuously. I asked urban company to get me fixed but there was no response from them. Also there is no plumber available at my location to fix this. There is no water at my home. They don't provide number for help they will place the option for call back. Where we have to wait to receive calls. No help is provided.
Booking never happens as per your request, they take your booking but then the beautician will call you and tell you any excuses to force you to either cancel or reschedule. I have booked twice and had the same experience! I booked for 3pm, then got a call that she don't have the products, she asked me to reschedule to someone can come. I did so. Wasted full day waiting for a professional to be assigned but they failed to do so. Utterly Disappointed.
Urban company unable ro give Deep clean service to AC that i booked and given only lite clean service. The difference in amount of 150 they need to refund. Otherwise i will consider urban company as beggers and leave the issue.
I changed my number since I don't have the old number and now I can't access my gift card and when I try to add, it says already activated
service good but too costly...
The cleaning was very professional, quick and clean
Good Company for your personal requirements
Good work
best service ever,Thank you for done work neatly.
They have recently removed the Hair trim and fringe cut styling option.It was very convenient earlier. Looking forward to see that back. Also there's no help center contact number or chat available on the app for customer enquiry.
No Service
My expert was sick and UC knew about it.. Yet there was no update or any sort of notification. I had to follow up by myself. First ever bad experience with UC.
Changed my mind, for not using it, after reading valuable & accurate reviews, about your sevice. Also, the app is really disgusting to browse and find one's needs, within the app.
Unable to download from the playstore
Nice saloon experience
Great. Highly professional and safe service. Very polite and efficient technician
super convenient & professional
Awesome
Earlier when I used to have bad services I used to think maybe this is because I am not in their plus program. (They advertise get only top rated plus professional) So i paid for the plus membership. But they kept sending the same 3-4 professionals to me who used to come before buying plus. And heights is that they sent newbies who have done 5-10 services only. My money is completed wasted. Not using UC ever again. I gave it a fair chance and got severely disappointed.
Unprofessional employees. They don't know how to be humble with customers..
A great service at your fingertips
Absolutely pathetic service and a complete waste of time and money. Please do not use their services.

thank you Niranjan and team for your great job..really happy with the service
You're add says 499 rupees for AC maintenance all inclusive... Can u please clarify
Add pedicure for men as well as an add on option in your offering
very easily booking nd good performance of work done ...
excellent
Nobody arrived for service, they rescheduled my booking thrice. After everything they just cancelled my booking, no apology nothing. Very unprofessional.
Op
very hardworking
Good
The professionals are never on time. They don't turn up as per schedule. This company makes money by wasting customers' valued time.
Professional service
Urban company started Chef service and it's just to fool people and it's total waste of time and money.....booked a chef naming Hemant chhetri who denied to visit twice even after reading the service description as mentioned in the app. Have been waiting to receive a call from UC but no one responded. #terrible cook # worst customer service.
Excellent service
good service..
Sparkling cleaning done
Good aap.. saving time & money
Waiting for your call you said on priority basis ????
Booked twice both time it was canceled. Pathetic service will never use again.
Very Bad experience from Urban Company, I have books two times, waited long time but for professional, I have called to professional many times but all the time he used to say coming shortly two hours passed no body came, and my order got canceled from professional side.
yes....it's was nice service
Good Company for the busy people.
Service experience is good but UC rules of auto cancelling prepaid services is highly objectionable. 2wc my prepaid services got auto cancelled for not responding to the phone calls of the executive. Due 2 network issue,the calls does not land. One executive reached our residance, her called was not answered bcz I was in washroom. She did not bothered to press the call bell and cancelled the service, when I called her, she said, its the rule of UC not to ring the call bell. Rediculous. C 2 it,
overall good services and rates are also Fair for most of services
Worst service
still to improve ur technicians
Nice experience with UC
good app
excellent
We had problem while login and sign up no
Excellent
I spoke with swathi sharma she is the worest costomar care instead of helping she is scolding me i hope you guys take action
Overall the experience was nice ,but still the cleaning agent should use the chemicals more often for hard stains and they must use the cleaning appliances given by the company ,if not company should give them some sort of machines for hard stain over bathroom tiles and kitchen tiles etc. I am giving the one less star just because I would like to see more perfect work
Exallent
Exorbitant prices for average services
Expensive but yes work gets done
Not bad
Not available in our area better to give service in all areas........
6 months back we booked for damp roofing worth 54k, they gave 10years warranty but after 4 months it got Crack everywhere. We raised the complaint in UC many times whereas they close the issue stating call not attended. But we haven't received even a single call from anyone. Guys pls don't go for damproofing with these ppl. There are more good services if u take up in Google near your door step and also many customer care ppl. I was literally got cheated by Urban clap.
good job
Very good
she is very professional
They give the best in-class services. Hands down winners. App is also well curated.

Good service with convenience and value for money.
very nice application
Pathetic service support , there is no information provided on the service booked and of the team is not able to assign the people for the service booked we need to chase them for the update and update
overall good experience, professional work.
Good service
Not happy with the services üòî professional behaved so badly
she's most perfect
Very nice service i got After service They Guys Clean out all the use area it self . One more feedback charges are High.
good we can call him again
Awesome
Great platform for professional services.
I am not changing my rating. But, I would like to give a notice of how dangerous the service can become. There was a requirement of wash basin. With total trust on UC I gave 8000 cash to the plumber and he didn't respond for few hours. He came back and completed the work just before i planned to raise a complaint. He did mess up the work and not responding anymore. Even the revisit call wasn't resolved. What would happen if he hadn't turn up after giving money? What action would UC take?
Excellent and on time service
This is very disgusting app. They don't give professional in proper time . I don't know why they give us to select our own slot when they can't provide professional in that time . Every time I book they ask me to reschedule it cancel. Very horrible experience. Do something with it or else no one use this
well done
Promt, excellent service.
Unprofessional.
Pathetic people are working for you i am trying to follow with your company seens very very long time people in your company dont want to attend call or dont want to give call back to understand what problem i am facing.
Inconsistent service standards lately. Assigned professionals do not turn up at time. even on bookings done a week in advance. Technicians do not have required spare parts but still confirm booking. Lastly they send unskilled professionals who damage your products.
Very good
Great app
good job
good
gentle, nice, professional
Very bad service it has
Service of urban clap is too much costly
Excellent service

Good
Pathetic and worst service provider I have ever seen. Booked full home cleaning before 3 days and no one arrived at the scheduled time and application still shows that professionals will be assigned before 1 hour of scheduled time...what a mockery they have made of themselves...shut down your business or else you will have to face the consequences...
Very good experience in this app iam very happy to app
Very prompt service
Unable to claim insurance. Support team is non-responsive.
Please do yourself a favor DONT call urbanclap.. the person stepped into my house n just looked at an appliance. Didn't even touch. The charges for stepping into my home is 500Rs?????????????? Are we all fools?????????? It seems the poor workers pay urbanclap 350rs for every visit?????? Intelligent guys n gals DONT encourage such a company which fleeces the customer and their so called employers
Can't provide back up if professional cancel booking say can't do because of system
I'm using 2nd time.but 2times I'm facing bad experience.1st reason the people mentioned service charge very less.but problem was telling very high amount.but problem was knot solved.
Very difficult to book my choice of professional in hair saloon segment, if the professional is not in pro segment.
Feb 26th review... Again a very disappointed service... Very very bad experience... I am not sure if I can trust urban clap for certain services again..
Some technicians are taking money to their gpay accounts for extra services...don't know how genuine they are...they are not allowing us to pay in the company app...
Not user friendly
Good service
Horrible company..I will never use your services again
Horrible Registered my request under bathroom Cleaning against kitchen chimney cleaning service. Sent untrained person who even didn't know how to open the mesh of my kitchen chimney. He had no knowledge of this service even didn't carry a toolbox. And charging at a high standard professional service They are treating customers as fools. I don't know about other locations as I booked the service from UC Indore
Thik takh hai
Good and timely service

Today I booked a AC service, no one has visited then what is in point booking???
Very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very poor Experience
very good services
Worth taking Urban Company Services.
good
Pathetic Service. Extremely unprofessional approach. They fail to assign the professionals after confirming the booking. This happened twice on the same day. Their inventory management sucks.
I really had bad experience with your girls.They are not perfect. The one who came today Tania saha to do my service said hair colour application means only root touch up! She was lying i knew. Moreover she burnt my skin and cut during waxing. During threading also she cut my skin. Moreover forcing me to give her 5 stars which she cannot. All those you show in advertisements the care, the perfectness are all false isn't it ? I am really very upset with your services. Teach your girls honesty
good app
Very unhappy with booking as each time unless I tip or avail their additional add on services there seem to be no technician available.Pathetic.
We're shifting tomorrow, so we needed someone to clean our washrooms, uninstall various appliances. Thanks To Urban Company it all happend in just few clicks at a reasonable price and with full punctuality.
Disgusting service, quality, customer care, professionals. They will not attend service unless you order services above 500 INR for salon services. They will cancel the booking and levy 50 INR charges for the cancellation which you didn't do. Doing business to fool customers.
Very poor customer service, they added a partener fee then a cash payment fee and now they added a time slot fee.
Pathetic experience. I scheduled a visit for pest control and the professional didn't arrive. On calling he said that I should have booked the service after telling him. Very unprofessional behaviour. It seems as if we are providing service not they. I will never ever do any booking and tell my friends not to do either.
nice service
It's good.
service price is high
my first experience with home salon was really good. Thank you
They don't assign professionals and cancel the booking last minute. This has happened with me 2-3 times now even after paying in advance and having membership. DONT GO BY THEIR NAME THEY ARE ONLY GOOD IN MARKETING BUT NO SERVICE AND CUSTOMER CARE IS ALSO USELESS. WASTE OF TIME!
amazing service
Extremely unprofessional staff and company. Take bookings when they also know that they cannot abide by the same. But customer is left hanging because he has paid money ! Nothing but blackmail and harrasment
Manoj was my video call guide. He has resolved the issue over phone itself. excellent service by manoj and urban clap. great job. keep it up.
It's such a great app
Awesome
super work
Totally unsatisfactory. No foam cleaner used. Outdoor unit not cleaned properly. Waste of money
I just gave a bad review a few min ago thinking it would never be resolved. I wrote to the given email address and received a call after a few minutes. The customer service agent, Shantanu was really polite and helpful. I was given a compensation credit for the first bad experience . The issue wasn't completely resolved because there's only so much an agent can do but otherwise I am very happy by the acknowledgement and will give another chance to UC.
Highly recommend.
Charges are for VIPs & ministers only it seems. If you are a middle class person, you will be fool to use this twice.
horrible
continue the excellent work.
good experience a person his work property
so far so good look more coupons and discounts to loyal customer
it was nice service from UC.... v happy...
I recommend you to start maternity or pregnancy massage for women, its very much needed, specially during third trimester. Also start after delivery 1 month package for new mom. Please let me know the package if you start this service too. TIA
Excellent work.worth for money.polite technician
Unnecessary additional charges, it was not there previously
nice
499 for Deep cleaning AC Advertisement in tv but when I booked they were charged 748. Giving 1 star is also waste , false marketing...
I had booked AC Servicing service from Urban Company for the first time. The technician did an excellent job. Use of foam, power jet helped to remove dirt from otherwise unreachable crevices in indoor as well as outdoor unit. Overall my experience of availing the service from Urban Company is as expected.
Experiencing awesomeness
Pathetic service. I stay in Bangalore and I was sent a person who doesn't know Kannada or English. And I don't know Hindi but he knows Hindi only. I couldn't instruct him anything to clean better. How can you send a person who doesn't know how to communicate to the customer. Ask customers if they are okay with Hindi language before you send a personnel. Not sure if this will reach Chief Product Officer Uninstalling this app
There is no contact number Or general chat center in your app. Shame I bought 6 month package from you. Hell with your CHOR company
Customer service is worst. First impression itself gone. App needs to be user friendly & needs lots of improvement.
Good. TEACHING CARE Online Classes
Worst app we are not happy
Booked for 7am but came at 8.15am, late service not acceptable
Good
This is the 3rd time for bathroom cleaning and first time for AC cleaning. Both the works done perfectly. Very happy with the work done and the behaviour of the individuals was very very good.
Wroust company ever dont book any service or dont to join in this company as a patner because will make you fool
Even we belong to the city where the service are providing whenever we are booking for service the message is coming no service in your area.
1 bathroom was good. And 2 nd bathroom wall tiles are 50 percent clean. We was very disappointed. Wast of money.
good
After spending 5000 for washing machine repair it is still not working. When asked for a refund I was asked for a quote from the washing machine company so they would only refund that amount. I'm a busy person so I opted UC to avoid such hassles. Now the warranty period has expired while the washing machine got never repaired so I don't have an option to get any refund!
Nice concept
It was a pathetic experience with some idiot assigned for men haircut . The fool won't pick call, UC wasn't bothered to inform that he won't be turning up and I wasted 3 hours waiting for resolution. Atleast offer free service as a compensation instead of hollow apologies.
Only serves to 0.1% of the population!!
Wrost experience from last 2 months tarriable....
Very nice app3
Difficult to put your requirements. CEO to understand, how customer can easily contact Co.
Poor customer service and poor customer resolution. Money minting company. Bathroom cleaning had stains left and when complained to customer service, they are more inclined in closing the request because I was 1 day late..What is the of use of UC member if you book 4 service in a month and get such poor experience. Standard answer is you are 1 day left Urban company said, mail them, which I did but no updates..Poor customer experience
I can see options for AC service only but not found AC gas filling although there is nothing where I can chat or get more information on request
My review is straight forward please don't act nasty. We no longer have option to select our previous professional. Urban company is detoriating quality cause it knows it's a monopoly.
In sofa cleaning service only 3 seater, 4 seater option given. L shape 3 seater option not given that causes confusion between professional and customer. Please introduce L shape sofa set cleaning option.
Pathetic company
Worst app and worst experience with uc I registered before two years as makeup partner and buy credit but they don't provide any single lead and now the credit balance is showing 0 how?
Perfect service, good ( Best receiving customer, and best servicing customer )
Vary bad service and vary pooer experience to urben company and I have no any parson recommend to use urben company app and services to my family and friends group your professional parson not able to provide great service ..
best service
Awesome service
Very good
nice app and service
We need to have a no to call to clarify doubts
UC has brought a revolution in the service
loved it. pushpa thx
Don't trust the guys who come ,they will break things and customer care does not respond properly,i was supposed call back today,they gives two missed call and say that I missed their calls.i lost 4000rs with property damage
Best service and behavior or technician
This is a waste app. When a customer is doing business of more than rs. 5000 every month. They do not see the business. They have blocked my account telling reason, that I have cancelled some bookings. I have raised a complaint on 14 Feb. Till now they did not solved and unblocked me. Hence. I m giving rating of 1star and uninstalling.
üò°while i was trying to cash on deliver option its not showing anythingüò°üò°and it showing due to unsubscription u dont have this options...then what the use of ur urban clap and recently we booked ur service for tubelight repair...the person came and just checked and took high amount...what the hell was with ur services...dont u keep best prices for middle class people...do u think that our money was getting from treesüò°üò°sense less app...which never helps us in problem...get lost bloodyüò°üò°
I've availed the services from Urban Company on 3 different occasions and each time was great with the technicians showing up on time, taking all the safety precautions and getting the work done quick
V good
Excellent on-time service... value for money.
Technician either comes 1 hour late or doesn't answer the phone call at all. It happened thrice in my case. I suggest everyone to use any other service provider instead of urban clap
For Home Repair work under electrical category isn't clear and it's vague to understand what is going to be provided. Actually, electrical work includes only a service cost nothing else. It is quite unclear to understand. That cost is bit a higher than market rates.
very impressed thanks a lot
excellent service
While I understand this is a service oriented app service. It's ridiculous that I have to face last minute cancellations, requests getting routed to Service Experts getting different/far off geographical locations. Unnecessary arguments with Cx support! That's my feedback.
I have booked for cleaning my bathroom,but I gathered very bad experience,they didn't clean bathroom,,as well as cheated us..most of the professionals are frawd,, please don't pay before work,, recently a professional Gopal Paul speak very sweet but actually frawd,,he promised to come but never came,so be care full when you book someone .
Best
costly
nice service
Kindly remove saftey fee, no one using proper gears.
Big cheating.. Not worth, They take money and will not work..
Awful experience. I have booked a PCR test at home and no body shown at the time and when i called urban company. They told me they will come back to me in 5 minutes and no body call . When I called them again it was 10 pm and there is no customer service available. Not recommended at all
I having worst experience with urban company it's been 1 and half months i didn't get my TV company don't have any clue when I will get don't have any control on technician . I have no choice to go consumer court. Zero star is only applicable to this company.
Cool & Great App !!...
UC is incapable of assigning professionals on time, I don't know on what basis it keeps the slots available. I am fed up with your apology calls and the statement we are trying hard to assign the professional manual?, Very inefficient.
6 years
Unable to download.
Good üòä
Good service
nice work
I paid for two service within a year but now showing cancelled
providing excellent services but availability of technicians should be increased
nice
I am so delighted to write this review. Urban company addresses so many issues together under one umbrella. I must say the creators of this app are GODSENT!!! Thank you for putting together such a fantastic application.
The app doesn't work. Simply pathetic
Very very bad experience as have paid in advance 10000 rs for the services and now they are not giving any slots neither they are responding back and no contact number where u can call ....am doing follow up but not getting my issue resolved
Very neat work and system of work. I like Urban Clap!! In the comfort of my home someone helps out without me participating at all. What better option can I ask for!? I would recommend highly.
Awesome
completely satisfied with the service and professionalism. The service person completed the work with total perfection. Would be availing their service hence forth.
Hello everyone urban khali loote ka kaam karti hai faltu ke labour charges or sab extra charges laga te hai so ye company par bharosa mat karna khali lutne ka kaam hai.
I had booked appointment for another beautician n they have changed to someone new. I m unable to even call them to get it resolved
Poor customer service
Instantly solved the Problem. best wishes

Very bad suddenly got stop to working Really irritating now I need to fix it
UC PROVIDES THE BEST SERVICES IN THE MARKET. I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE UC EXPERTS. THANKS UC.
This was my 3rd, service booking related to 3 separate issues. 1st was 3*, 2nd was 4* & 3rd may get 5*.
excellent services

Home cleaning is expensive and absolutely not worth it
Worst app .i am waiting from 6days .to book an appointment .but evertime its shows all professinals are bsy ...
Excellent
Very Bad üòî for me not available at my hometown.
very nice
excellent service
I started using this app few days back and I have a prime subscription. Whenever i open the service 'Saloon for men' it snaps and shows an error 'something went wrong'. This issue is happening from past 3 days. I have given feedback twice since then but nothing gets sorted. Worst app experience from UC. I will not recommend this to anyone
Yasin was very kind and explained the process of cleaning. Perfectly cleaned everything. Good work, keep it up..
Good service provider.
Worst App professionals get different address on their screen from what customer has booked
quick availability of workers
Superb service done by technicians, called for Deep cleaning of split AC. Thorough wash and cleaned by experts
I am currently having the worse experience getting a resolution from these people. It's all fine until some professional screws it up because when that happens these guys quietly stop treating the customer with priority or any justice. My mattress cleaner has ruined our mattress after doing a shabby job for which I have sent 5 videos on their email. I keep being told I'll get a call within an hour when I try reaching out and yet i get no calls it's like they are trying to get rid of customers.
Electrician from UC was commissioned on 12th to replace motor of a ceiling fan.Advance of 1050 was taken for same,he has neither done the service nor refunded the amount. Repeated calls to UChelp has not yet helped as professional didn't refund. Disappointed and helpless.
the ony reason I use UC is Daisy
I have tried to book a professional several times but everytime i book only one thing is showing that all professionals are busy at your location. It is happening from last 2-3 months . I don't want UC now. Uninstalling it !
Awesome experience...... wow ü§ó
Good service
Bekar
Professionals are always late, very bad customer service.
This company has very good ideas how to cheat people they shows lot of offers with wallet payment but they doesn't give any cashback.
Good app
Booked for washing machine service and they sent some one with no experience. They charged more and was unable to refit the washing machine properly after service. Now the machine is not working properly.
It was great experience
excellent app fr service related matters. qualified and expert people who provides the services. Safe and hygienic professionals..Have taken lots of services and i am totally satisfied. Keep up the good work.
The App provides Superb service...
App needs improvements badly
Best app used till now
Why my review has been deleted? Are you guy's playing with me???????
worst customer care service they even don't desk properly. they cancle call suddenly.
I have booked bathroom cleaning service and the service provider did wonderful Job...took his time for clean the area and he was very polite... strongly recommend
I'm so disappointed for the first time. My booking is automatically reschedule without my concern/permission. On the top of that they have not even informed me about the same. Now from last 1.5 hours you guys are fixing my issue by not calling me or updating me about it. My god. I'm wondering that you guys are searching for a beautician or Alien? This is a prepaid service which was booked by me. Such a third grade service. I request the users not to be fooled by their advertisement.
Stop your fake advertisement .worst service your technician not trained nor expert. He refuse to clean my bathroom and said cancelling the service .I am taking move on cleaner service but he is not able clear hard water stain in new flat .don't want to use service again. Waste of money....
thank you are one company Hussain Ahmed very good personal

Very good service and I am really happy
Nice app.
Excellent Service
Smart and easy
Great work
Poorest of poor and unethical service. I want to talk to a sevice executive urgently
very good & professional company
Tried for half an hour but couldn't add full arms and face wax option at same time. If I added full arms face wax got removed from cart and if I added face wax then full arms option got removed.Don't understand what's the issue. Very disappointing issue. Pleas fix this
Awesome job done by electrician
nice work
100 % satisfactory job
Job done perfectly
The worst cleaning service I've used to date. No support from customer service when assigned a completely unprofessional cleaner. Bond impacted. Stay away and avoid a cleaning nightmare.
Worst service
Always getting best services at reasonable prices. Thanks to UC.

Useless service Unprofessional people coming to fleece money from u and even not reporting actual amounts in bills..using cash money instead
The app is easy to navigate but the charges for all services are not justified, plus no offers or coupons.
I've used this app much for getting services. But when it comes to providing a support, they don't even give a damn. An electrician has taken two fans from my house on 10th of February and today is 23th of the same month. 13 days I had to sleep without fan. On 11th day I had to approach nearest police station and they had to call the electrician for giving back the properties they have taken. I can see the negative reviews of the electrician and Urban Company has not taken any action against him
very good
Thugs Company Being Ran by Likes of Abhiraj who himself tells his employees through email not to respond to customers. These are bunch of jokers who believe in looting the customers
This app is very useful üëå
worked satisfactorily, but price charges for materials is bit high.
Big cheater, very very high charges for smal things, don't waste time in this app, you can find much cheaper mechanic in your local area in 6 times cheper
I am a yoga trainer and also uc partner, I would like to know when the yoga service will be launched?
Such a bad experience.. charging much more than usual local business. And they don't refund remaining amount to the customer and keeps it as UC balance.
I dont see urban company as customer centric. I have booked salon service 10 times day after day.And everytime i heard apology we are rescheduling it.but they did not deliver the service. I used to rely on UC ,but now i have no hope and not interested in listening to apology from them instead of service..i am finally looking other options now.
Very bad experience recent times. Not like before. Not at all punctual. Went on postponing the time and dates.
Very nice üôÇ
They have worst service professional and when we give negative review they block my future service.
Worst Experience ever

Priyanka was very nice at her work
Not able to serve at turkayamjal which is near to vanasthalipuram
3rd work by his team no support from company to customer
Services could be made much better, rate card prices are wrong. Told by technician.
We booked for bathroom cleaning services .. they did very well , thanks to urban company
I engaged for full house cleaning and plumbing work. Found excellent.
very good service
Poor service. Not happy at all. Always an technical issue every second week with my regular booking. Now "welfare fee" is added! What is that? The more expensive they becoming the more unreliable they are.. For booking any spa services they force you to book more cause of the minimum amount. This is not realistic!
Utterly disappointed by UC. The professional never turned up for a pre-paid booking and UC repeatedly kept lying that they tried to reach me, while I never received any call. Pls refund the entire advance alongwith the yearly membership. Sham Company!
Professional Service
Money paid for a service and not assigned a professional after 4 days also
urban company Rate card are mentioned split Air conditioners deep cleaning service charges Rs749/- but they are charged Rs 2048/- this is totally different from ratecard
Awesome
Edit 22/02/22 They have different options for home cleaning eg: referigator cleaning etc. The professionals are unaware of such work. We add extra adons which are a waste of money as the work does not happen. Similarly with salon service I booked a beard spa which is non existent. You charge us for cancelling our order but what about compensating customers when you can't deliver what you promised. This is a one sided issue. You are cutting the cake and eating it too. Bad company ethics
I would give zero star to this app. We expected some professional to do this job bt the person came for totally unprofessional. Its is such as disappointing experience. Work was not properly done. Guys was such in hurry he didn't fixed the issue properly... Wont suggest it to anyone..
The experience was very bad. I have generated a booking and added my address as it is required. However, the UC they themselves select wrong area on the GPS and the manual address that I have mentioned was different. The day when my beautician was supposed to come she was not able to find my house as per GPS. I am explaining her my address. After on hour she said somehow the GPS shows other address and manual address is different. This is not my fault and I paid 25Aed.
excellent on time, less talk more work professional behaviour, thanks for ur service
There's some issue with the app, couldn't able to install the app and its not working well, and why is everything service is 100 ruppee more expensive than any other phone
Always services are canceled after scheduled booking and payment made in advance
Completely cheating with bad service and their price different, they are demanding more after coming here.
Bakar
Pathetic service representative did nothing only took money zero rating
very nice
Excellent service and begavy
UC is not good at communicating with the customer or even at reading the feedback. The app asks for multiple ratings & questions and written review. I gave 3.5 but had given the an excellent review for the professional in UC QnA & in writing that the professional was great but the helpline was not as they lied to me. But without reading my review, the professionals account was blocked for bad service even though he had gone out of the way to provide service when the company wasn't willing to.
I have tried 2/3 services its very good and affordable.
Never download: Worst service provided by this company, the app say wonderfull about the services but when the professional visit for the service they reject saying this is not included in the service you have to pay more for the services. Disspointing service, pathetic professionals. I would request every one not to download this application and opt for any kind of serivice they provide even for free of cost. We should not encourge this kind of apps to harass people with fake promises.
Superb
You may ask customers to take photo and post it in service provided before closing the s ervice
Best
Immensely useful for day to day problems
Hlo sir i need a job can u tel me how can i call u
excellent service
Services provided at home and moreover Social media team is working good.
I have already made a payment for to your plumber but still payment is pending
Overall good service keep it up
The technician who arrive have sometimes no expirience. They have absolutely no scrutiny or background check. If you get someone good, it's basically a Fluke. they really have to improve on personell .
No body calls you from their end of you have an issue...like in my case I booked the service for kitchen cleaning and the professional didn't arrive. They keep on saying we will contact you. If you call on customer care nobody will pick your call. Company made my first experience a very bad one. I will recommend not to book any service from these people as if you cancel a booking then they will charge extra amount but if problem is on their end then no response.
Very bad service and partners
Bahut bada app
Very bad experience with the app. The tiket was raised many days before and still no response from their side
Worst experience Every time professional not available at my location
Last experience with washroom cleaning professional was amazing and very appreciative
excellent service done . particularly by sukanth and his team
Inconsistent service is main reason for uninstalling this app. Been using them for over 3 years and it just went downhill for some reason. Hope theyll improve but for now its not worth of money and prices
fansatic
Every time when i start booking for Ac service it says professional are not available. Note from last six months i am trying
soap cases were not cleaned properly. full of soap. when asked he said "you have to change to new ones.chemical is not supporting to clean"
excellent service
Good service
Their services are 100% appropriate according to what is listed. Their ac service as per me is the best and they live up to the guarantee made and repair without any charges if there's a fault within the guarantee period. I deducted 1 star because if their pricing. It's a little on the higher side but it's somehow okay because they're giving you doorstep services.
why can't I book a couple message.?
Making fool of people and charging for visit in the name of service. If your mechanic couldn't fix things you should refund the service charge.
Poor coordination overall. Service person hardly gets appointed,. And its too on paper only. Many times customer keeps waiting and service person never comes ( on time is too far to comment)
3rd class customer service, unprofessional technician,fraud company ,they are only doing fraud and making money from it please never take service from this fraud company.0 star rating.
best service provider always
Unprofessional service
Very very happy.. UC thank you sooo much...
Excellent service
UC provides good service, however the price charged appears to be on a higher side in many services.
üëç
Bad experience. Quite unprofessional. The professional did not turn in in time and gave some excuse that the call was not answered whereas no such call was made.
Excellent
excellent service provided . more than expected ...it makes life so easy ....
Overpriced.. The company charges double the cost of service.. Not only service the material priced is also double.. I branded drain pipe cost 150 plus a 50 installation is priced at 600 on urbanclap.. Heights!!!! Bhai kitna lootega..
they worked really hard and we are satisfied with their job thank you team
Good servicd
If UC consider wooden sliding window has doors then would door look ..bizzare...instead of repairing with UC we can purchase a new one..
It's too expensive to simply rub the chimney surface with kerosene oil for 15 min.
Excellent service
I had booked a professional for repair of my refrigerator. He came yesterdsy at 9 am and asked to keep all the things inside the fridge outside and switch off the fridge for 3-4 hours for melting of ice. He assured us he will visit in the afternoon to start the repair. Inspite of repeated calls neither he came nor any response from the customer service even after repeatedly writing to them. By night most of the items we had to throw as they had gone bad. Highly irresponsible behavior.
They get your phone number while registering and then says we don't serve in your area. This should be opposite. First let us know if you service in our area and only then ask for our phone number. Bad move.
great
Professionals are not good in kanpur city. I am facing the same problem again and again as uc is sending new untraceable professionals. They didn't even communicate properly
Excellent
Good and faster service provider urban company I am happy uc
Good service and on time
excellent
Satisfied
Good

We've been using Urban Company App for a lot of things and it's quite effective, value for money and very safe. No one can cheat you and Quality of professional is also very good.
Excellent initiative with video call service Got my problem solved in 5 min Mr.Pankaj was really Helpful
No idea
8 years
good experience
happy services
Good service
whenever you think for services at home just think urban company perfect service and perfect proffessionals.
Very good
good platform
Expensive at times
One of the worst service apps I have ever experienced. Did a half baked job on my bathroom cleaning. Several of my styling appointments were confirmed and then cancelled just around the booking time in the same day.. It was very difficult to arrange a replacement on a moment's notice. Call centre people are also very unprofessional, one actually asked me to not pursue my complaint any further as he would loose his job for not resolving my issue without actually resolving my issue.
very good services
Very good service and professional approach.
It's completely cheating app. Once you'll booked service, they'll accepted our request, then the service day before schedule time they'll call n say, sorry professionals not available. Can u rescheduled? Its waste of ur time
Untrained staff for Spa... you may have serious health problems... do not use this option from them ever.. I am facing serious consequences
The technician refused to provide the service on ground floor. My father is 80 yrs old cannot be mobile. The ground floor is spacious and have a garden in front. The technician refused to provide the service upfront and walked out requesting cancellation. I am not sure what kind of space more better that a beautiful garden he required. Now I no longer require urban clap
Excellent service
Technicians are incomplete especially with refrigerators. They fooled us, replaced 3 parts, when it didn't work said Gas problem. Damaged wires. Paid for 3 parts plus service whereas 2 parts didn't require change and wires were cut, taped in place of socket. Other technician repaired easily as he was competent. But 7 days lost. Plus unnecessarily damage to parts. Lucky to hv avoided damage as Cust care was insisting on Gas refill with charges. Said if still fridge does not work we will refund.
This is my third time using UC and every time I had to call for revisit. The last one terrible disaster.
No one available when I needed the barber. Tried to get appointment many times but no one was available.
The most disgusting experience I ever had with any online services application. Neither they have professionalism, nor they are honest. A bunch of unethical, shrewd and unworthy people. They only know how to cheat the customers and make their staff struggle for information. A classic set of ...
Services are good. But prices are high.
superb job done
Awsm ü§™
This was my first booking ,the cleaner didn't show up on stipulated time he was late by 3 hrs ,he didn't have enough acid and asks me to buy the acid ,i booked intense cleaning and paid 548 he says it doesn't matter which package you choose we will do the same thing he didn't use machine, and leaves the work place unfinished saying will complete next day. when asked about the remaining work he says that he's having another booking and denied to complete the work next day , his name is ganeshan
Great üëç
Had hired for kitchen cleaning, Very bad service as they use same old scrubber used in other houses (don't know whether it was used in kitchen or bathroom/toilet room), the agent was in hurry so he didn't clean the kitchen properly. God only knows why they don't use new scrubber for every new service since they charge so much.I had to clean my kitchen again. Horrible experience, not going to use UC services again.
very professional job .
Very good all india company
Good
First time right is every time right. First service by UC, bullseye and I know why they are preferred.
Excellent App and most important Excellent Service providers üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
Good
When u book pay after service ur booking will not be taken. Saying the professional is not available. Whenever u book with pre payment it will not happen . Professional will be at ur door step on time. it happened 2-3 times with me. When u cancel it within one hour they will deduct 50 rs but when they are not able to provide u the service they will not even bother...Very very disappointed..
Great service with 100% Satisfaction.
superb
The best service provider. Video consultation service is the game changer. Keep it up guys. UC rocks
Mm
Very Bad Services
it's very good
Very difficult to contact them. Bad service
Very bad experience
Great service.
Pathetic service as beautician are rude and don't have manners to speak to their clients and beautician has cancelled the appointment and UC have deducted charges from the advance i paid .need refund of my entire amount as fault was of beautician she cud not manage to come on time and top of that she is telling me, this is not big deal, if I come late by 20 minutes. UC website..we honour our comittment to provide services to clients on time. Thsi type of beautician,Hetal vaghela, u guys hire.
This app is very good and service is very quick
very much appreciated
Good service...
Excellent.
Excellent!!!!!
Worst ,worst,worst,
Good
too much cost even for little work
Bad experience I had called them for my deep bathroom cleaning the girl whom they send had no experience in cleaning these people pride themselves in being expert professional but.....
very good
good services
Fraud don't install it worest app and costumer care
Lately the services are either delayed or cancelled. They reschedule on their own. And cancellations are always last minute. Highly unprofessional.
I am truly disappointed, i had booked for 3pm but no professional was assigned and they called and asking to reschedule after the scheduled time. They don't care about your other important work but they ll force you to book according to them. Such a horrible service and employees
Absolutely 3rd class service provided. They respect time of customers and take them for granted. Pls invest in your Customer Relation Management if u want to sustain in Service industry !
well groomed beauticians with authentic products
Awesome experience.
0. I don't want to give rating to this worst serviced Application. I had a booking yesterday. The service professional accepted the booking. Then he calls me that he will come 1.5 hrs late as he is already in some other service. No single response from URBAN CLAP till now. I have given my contact number perfectly, they keep on messaging they we are unable to reach you on phone etc. How can they not reach me on call when I gave my perfect phone number? How can UC encourage such professionals?
Very good
Good
Very unprofessional company.Does not provide services at the scheduled time and changes your appointment without prior confirmation with you at their own convenience.
Excellent service
I took the AC servicing. It was a 5* experience. The Guys are real professionals. Neat n Clean Job. Also, they advise on how to save & economically use your AC for a longer life. I am personally impressed with the Services
Damaged my refrigerator post cleaning and now no one is ready to take responsibility
Was professional and did a very clean job
extremely good service. thank you UC...
very professional staff. well trained and they are in full appreciation of the company. seems company took well care of their staff in covid times.
The services offered by UC are always satisfactory. Their task force are hard working and always do their job with due diligence.
ok
I have paid Rs.747 for hair dressing and shaving at my residence for yesterday but I cancelled this programme. The refundable amount of Rs.747 has not been returned to my bank account yet. Please expedite the process of refund. Thanks VS Raman Shela Ahmedabad Gujarat
Good App and service
Excellent services on Video Consultation for diagnosis of the problem that too free of cost . "The Urban Company has an immense scope in rural areas" where technical expert is usually not available in remote villages and the services provided by the sellers are very costly and are sometimes not even provided for even six months of booking the complainant. Hope this Company grows and reaches the doorstep for providing services in remote villages around 30 Kms from main district. Best Wishes.
Superb!!!!!!!!!!!!
very good service
They didn't provide another professional on the given time , if the assigned professional is unavailable. They will call customer and ask them cancel or change the slot. Disgusting. This is all happening after taking the MEMBERSHIP.
Bigtime Scamsters
Facing problem in app. Not all servcies showing. Plus urban clap charging very high price on selected services so make it more competitive pricing
Very bed experience More then 3 time service and not resolve my problem and not satisfied answer by urban team
I have utilised your service , technician skill is ok but service charges is more . During complain service charges was showing 199/- but after finishing of work it was 349/- It is totally fraud. you must clear everything before.
good service
The professional neither come on time nor showing in tracking section that he is approaching. Shameless UC says will deduct money if we cancel or reschedule. Nonsense we are waiting for him for half an hour after the scheduled time for the work of 10-15 mins. Unprofessional UC give me ur CC number, dnt hide behind the uneducated unprofessional service or repair persons.
Don't book any salon service from them specially on weekends. They take too many bookings and don't have enough professionals so they cancel your bookings at the last moment. I am now switching to a better option called yesmadam.
Unprofessional be people will all over the app they won't come on time no proper response from the partners
really good
Earlier it used to be good service now they have n number of conditions with low quality. Wont suggest to use there service to anyone.
Good in salon services
Guh
Worst services!! They dont give full refund if you cancel booking for some reason.
Worst app ..i had taken 1 year plan after that always shown our professional not avillable
This app is not working from past few days..
Such a shame
Worst experience
Vary bad
nice
liked the service
I took the salon services and was not at all satisfied.
Worst customer care service support. There is no negative Star otherwise I would have give negative 5 star
charges are high
Very Professional Team
very good service .completed intime as said
App for all your need.
great service
Worst timing sense of the professionals. Not even one professional arrives on scheduled time or booked time. Worst service by urban company n professionals also
Excellent experience
Their service is so good that whenever we want something fixed or cleaned in the house, even my mom, who is generally skeptical of online services, recommends me to use their service.
good
Unprofessional and asking offline charges bypassing UC.
Not upto the mark... The professional denied to complete the job and kept arguing stating that even if he does the best job the marks will still be there
great
good
great service provider
Pushpalatha Ma'am was very polite and soft. She did the work very neatly. Thank you. Great service
While the professionals they hire are great,the company itself seems to be a rag tag group. They make frequent child like errors. You'll find more success in banging your head on a wall than with their customer care. Their unethical practices with the professionals has been well publicised. If anyone knows of a better competitor, please share their details. My experience was pathetic. You guys should be ashamed, the professional was so scared of your treatment, offered a refund at his cost.
very helpful for at home salon services. Professional providing services are well mannered, trained and punctual.
The app design could be better..when am booking salon services and making my own package it tends to get confusing when I am trying to cross check what I have selected before going to the payment step. Editing my package should be easier and there should be a way to bookmark previous selections.
Unprofessional service unethical service, they wont come on time and they denied to do service..
Good...
Very good
Very nice app.
Quite expensive and fake deals. For instance, they advertise certain discounts for specific services, then at the last step, when the payment comes, you realise they offer half of what they promised. Not recommended! Justlife is better!
professional work
Great app
Excellent
Excellent service
Pathetic Experience don't buy Urban Premium.
Not use full in this app.there is a lot of ads
They dont inform when uc rewards are getting added and they expire, total waste.
I just moved to a new place and didn't knew anyone here who can help me with carpenter, plumber or these kinda work and was in urgent need. Thanks to UC i just booked a technician and he was at my door step before my desired time. Job was done with utmost comfort and convenience at a kinda reasonable price. I feel like UC is an amazing platform for not just people like me but for people who are looking for work as well. Love UC.. Thanks üôè
awesome
good job
great service at home
A must app for many services.
Excellent service. I always prefer and recommend UC
I booked 3 Split AC Jet Foam Wet Service from Urban Company and paid 100% Advance payment on the trust of Urban Company After the job is finished , I was forced to Pay 120 Extra even after talking for 30 minutes on Customer Care by Technician Then i got a Call back from UC that we have technical Glitch on Partner App's thats why this is happening I asked for 240 UC Credits refund for the harrasment i faced, they declined , hence i am giving them 1 Star rating.
Good service
Worst service.. the professional came and he want to repair one of the part and he will do it by taking it to office, but the APP is not providing any confirmation for the same.. am I looking like an idiot to give my part without any confirmation.. useless..
Pathetic service
They change the appointment to a different slot without intimation. We are waiting for the professional and no body turns up. As the company grows in size they are unable to manage. Better look for something else
Supreb app very help full thank you
Very good
Very disappointed. You can't even reach out to the customer care service after booking a service. Please don't use this app.
best app for instant services
Worst experience on a service app. Total fraud. Booked and rescheduled 3 times for hair cut. Paid up. Nothing. Don't sign up.
Naushad is very professional..he is very polite and full of knowledge.he gives correct advise.i wish him all the best in his future.
good
very good service
Awesome app.
very costly
Worst experience all the time.... Whenever I book bathroom cleaning cleaners will finish there work... I don't know what they will be doing in bathroom.... Dirt remind as it is.... Specialties of these workers they are well trained in talking but they are not trained professionals..... All bathroom reminds same as it will be before and they will make busy in talk soft soft and we like mad agree whatever they tell.... Useless and money eater urban clap.... Worst ever experienc all the time....
Please provide bride or groom mehandi for wedding and all other mehandi for different occasions.
Definately a UI When I click on waxing section under salon category. It navigate me back to the same page. Very frustrating.
Urban company reveals the customers ratings to technicians which makes the company unprofessional, They don't seem understand what privacy means.. prices are high but services are not upto the mark
Very bad service, they automatically cancel the appointment stating that there is no person after confirming the appointment...
Prompt service provided. Well mannered and very competent service provider. Very happy with the service.
Professionals are polite and well trained.
Good
The app keeps crashing every time I try to give a tip
They accepted for service. But they don't have any person to assign. We have been waiting by cancelling all the programs. But they don't even feel responsible to call and inform. When I called them then they are simply saying there is no one to assign.
The technician Satish came for TV installation.The job was done well.Very cordial and nice service
Very good
efficient fast, good prices.
excellent service
Horrible. Especially the carpenters assigned.
No customer support.No way to raise issues with billing
Really disappointed with the service in Urban Company Kolkata. Have faced this issue before and even today, professionals are not available and bookings get cancelled at the last moment. Then why trust your service ? If informed from before then we can look for other options. There is a dearth of uc professionals in Kolkata.
Excellent service!
very useful app
superb. excellent for bikni wax
it's a good app, and very useful indeed & come in handy for us in emergency times
best work very satisfying
good
A good offerings but ZERO CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Technicians cancel at the last moment and no urgent support is provided.
Excellent services
Deepali was polite know her jobs well it was a great service I like it
Corona is Over but beggars are still begging on the name of safety charges. Shame on such non rated beggar attitude of this company. Now they will change the name of begging and continue begging .They had made Corona an opportunity to loot customer. Forcibly, charging extra for safety and support. Such type of low standard company that they can't afford rs. 5 mask and gloves. They must be ashamed. Ridiculous people. That's not only about Rs 49 but that's reflection of their rotten thoughts.
With the new update I am unable to contact your customer service. Also unable to get service from previous professional. You people need to fix these bugs asap.
App is not getting installed. It's getting stuck on 64% install process.
You don't provide services in my area.
never book UC
Worst experience ever in uae, I requested two clearners and one of them left without doing her part and when I complained to customer service. The agent was very roude and arguing that nothing can be done and you can do whatever you want I don't care
Excellent
üëåüëå
Nice
I am very happy with all the services
It keeps restarting since the update, need to keep unstalling and re installing after each booking!
Quality workmanship, Adequate process and quality checks in place, overall an excellent experience with UC..
This must be the most pathetic pest control services provider ever. I had asked for cockroach control service. Between Sep21 till Feb22 they sent six so called experts, who had no idea of the type of pest and the correct chemical to be used. I had to suffer six visits of unqualified professionals during peak pandemic with ZERO effect on the cockroaches. Ultimately I changed the company. They diagnosed a German cockroach infestation, used the right chemical & our house was finally pest free!
Great
Looks like my previous review was deleted. Still can't see anything that says it won't spam my notifications with ads.
App is not working
malar Kodi serives very good
Exclent
Excellent service
Actually I thought to book an appointment But before that I just went through a Google review but everyone has gives only single star Urban Company achieve this kind of star ratings who will book an app after seeing these kind of worst reviews you have explanation for each and every Star ratings the company has to focus on 5 star rating and customer satisfaction is the main important thing in this so the thing is I came to book an appointment but after seeing the Google review I think its worst
yesterday i called from urban clap for the very first time & i am happy with the services, everything wss perfect be it behavior, following covid protocol & service... thank you urban üëè
Not all the hiring is professional one. As last time experience was horrible
Kindly add body polishing in salon services.. As you don't have body polishing service I have to book beautician from another app
Very bad experience. Not professional and bad service.
Trying to login using my credentials but cant at it shows error something went wrong, bit confused with that error seems i hv done a mistake by downloading this apps, or really its a glitch
Good
subperb

You do not have computers section, please add that, am an computer science engineer, we do macbook services and chip level motherboard or logic board and screen display repairs, I want to give services from your platform, so please add that.
Still you dont have any service in salem
Don't provide customer care number. If got cheated you can't connect with any one.
Hi it was my first time with urban company. The professionalist name was Anita darjee,she was so polite and we'll trained her service was so relaxing for me and with all hygiene she did her job ...next time I'll prefer her for my future visits...thanks
Rate high
I ordered electrician for inverter servicing he should bring four bottles of water as I have 2 battery inverter , he bought 24 bottles which is not required now and unesscarily it's occupying space at home
Good and hygenic service from the convenience of your home!!
Good service
good application and good service executives
Very good üëç
Nice but the price are very lowest in company
Always service unavailable
excellent
I had a very bad experience , I booked electrician to change the switch he broke the electric board and I have to buy a new again he change job and put new installation , charged more than double, again he disturbs the earthing fetch again I have to call him again he ask me for 1500 I said I am not going to pay as customer care told me for verification no charges finally he agreed. Again he told me to take his personal mobile no so that he may reduce the charges , still problem not solved...
They are doing fraud now I tool services and not satisfied even having blood patches. After I connected customer care she told me they only give same service again but consume within one week. Who is doing waxing in one week. The hidden things thy never mention. Even every e-commerce flat form having 30days return police.and their customers support is also horrible they called so many time and asked the same thing but issue will not resolved this the last time I booked
I had taken chimney cleaning, Ac cleaning & pest control services. All of them were excellent. The service boys are very polite & responsible
good service but lil expensive
Excellent
Very good service. Polite and cordial
Very bad experience with customer care. Services are fine but customer care is usless.
Very bad app experience as well as customer service experience. I am not able to book a service for over a week now. No support or reply from the customer care email. No customer care phone number available. Total waste of time. Pathetic. No support or care towards the customer.
Awesome service...very much satisfied with the cleaning done...A special applause for Jitender kumar Yadav n his team...
The services are lon listed in a comprehensive manner.. 2-3 similar services are given, under diff categories with diff prices and often misleading or no description. Also, there should be an option to choose the professional
CAUTION: A Fraud company !!!! This is my honest review guys, please do not take any service from this company. I booked painting service from this compant and spent 50k just for 2 BHK apartment. After 2 week it started peeling off. They promised 1 year warranty and now they are denying same, citing I have not guided them for water solution !!!. Pathetic management and service. They use local workers, which can be hired in 1/3rd of amount this company charging. @Urban: Stop cheating customers!!!
excellent service
Very poor service and customer care agent supporting their poor service.
very good
Beutician cancelled the request and I am being charged , why ? And don't have any customer care
Not yet got refund. Cheater company.
Worst experience. Jada paisa hai to pay karo.
It was good Shilpa was very good and polite
No customer care... Pathetic
There is no contact details of this company if we have any issue while booking
We have taken painting service from urban company.. we are not satisfied with there service. After 2 months there are lot of patches in some areas and paint is also gone. Please don't take painting service from urban company..
App not downloading
Unprofessional people and wasting time since 2 days there assigning a carpenter and the time of service they call and say sorry mam today is not available shall I book for tomorrow, tomorrow same thing happened bad experience with carpenter üôÑ
Dont opt urban clap for painting service. They will tell 1 year warranty for painting service. But when issue arrives, they will just say that is not coming under them without visiting the site even though it comes under warranty. Even they will call you multiple times. But they will not resolve your issue. Just they will add comment to your post saying something.
too good
Very friendly app
Too expensive. They are asking 300 for saree pehana... Ab koi ladka pant aur shirt pehanne ka 300 rs dega??? Hum ladki log roj free me mirror ke samne saree pehan lete h...
From last 5 days I am trying to make booking and no professional is getting assigned They grab the money from user and do not allot professional and upon asking for refund then say that Tak UB credits or else we will refund in 7 days that never happens Also when you try to rech to customer support they show no empact behave love robot and few are so rude THIS COMPANY IS SCAM
Amazing app for salon.i loved the salon services . highly recommend
It is a time taking experience. The professional assigned took 70% of the payment and has not completed the work. It has been 1 week now. They don't get back on time. I am not satisfied. I hope my issue will be solved soon.
Very professional.
Worst ppl Frud ppl in urban company
Totally unprofessional
AC installation is 1500.. gas charging 2500.. just bcoz its online they loot u.. folks its YOUR hard earned money.. find a local guys A hinge repair is charged 250.. all these 3 jobs i did it locally under 3000.. dont pay 30% premium just coz u r too lazy to find a guy.. useless app..such companies are called start up india .. its just eating up poor guy's money..
Dry cleaning of sofa and carpet was done today which was over by 3.00 pm. We were told that the sofa and carpet will be completely dry and ready for use after 3-4 hours. Eight hours have passed but these items are still very wet and water is dipping from the sofa. It is not dry cleaning at all but wet/water cleaning. The work done is totally unprofessional. What the hell!
If at all my money is reversed ill give you a good rating
First give services in All over Hyderabad...After that concentrate other countries...
Very friendly professionals. They maintain an extremely good professional attitude whenever they come to work
great service
Worst experience, so horrible situation we faced. The electrician who came demanded amount for personal and when we denied he cut the wires and went away. We lost trust on your Urban company.
The professionals are not professionals actually. Its like if you hurt your leg then the so called professionals would recommend you to change your leg.. A 2 rupee repair would cost you 1000 rupees replacement.
Worst booking experience and worst service by uc professionals.
No response for any issue highlighting no customer support to solve the practical problems not trustworthy service
It is sad to see that compell customers to go for a premium service. The cleaning professional refused to deliver the service saying that bathroom is dirty! He said he will clean only if upgrade to intense deep cleaning. Customer care guys were of no help, with their scripted answers . The cleaning professional even gave it to me in written!
Worst service by the urban company cleaning services, I have booked a service and it's got rescheduled twice, and the service was very poor. I have booked a service intense deep cleaning, professional didn't used anything they took, they used my detergent for cleaning and not used the machine provided by UC. I cant recommend uc for cleaning services.
service is so excellenr
They cancelled my bookings without informing me, they are not on time. Unskilled professional.... Toral waste of your money Not just one service....i book spa n bathroom cleaning.... Worst experience
was good
Unprofessional And west of Money Service don't used This app even I am talen services but not use Full
Unprofessional services. Very poor quality. Till date the services are getting of poor quality.
It was my first time with Urban company and I must say that I am in love with their services. Would love to avail their services again in future. Thank you
great
Awesome and mess free service
Well designed and well functioning
They don't respect their timings.
okay üëå thanks
This app is not finding useful
I can't edit the address, there is no way I can talk to a helpline about this. Not a friendly app. Services shown in app and website are different, no way to edit a profile on website, no option to update an address. Poor app. Services booked are rescheduled due to unavailability.
It's pathetic two times it got cancelled without informing
Excellent work ‚úî üëç
too high charges
Very good for ladies specially for kids mother who can't go out for long time . getting all benefits in home. Wonderful
Henceforth I will recommend all of my friends for your good service.I hope more option about service charge to be included in future specially small size of latrine ( 3'*3'). Thanks
Very bad experience.
They will cancel service at last minute. Such a worst service they are providing, unprofessional people with no experience, never ever consider this company. Very bad service.
I used classic apartment home cleaning service and it's superb..
Good Workers
Good service.. would be great if gardening services were also available
Worst service
Very bad experience. Lady from salon service did not visit twice even after rescheduling as per their request. UC needs to keep a track of service quality.
Used for hair dressing work. Very Good and Professional.
Good work urban clap great service provider
Updating it after so many months, still the worst company to deal with..waiting a call back from sanjna from last 2 hours.. no response.. I wish some other company comes up and trach them a lesson in professionalism..hey have a system wherein you can't reach out to them and only option is to wait for their call back, which never happens. Pathetic company
Very good and prompt service.
Waste of time online company is not best nearby mechanic always supporting
Docait is the right word for this company... They are looting and always making false promises. You can not do anything about it. Do not use their services...please go for your local mechanic...
Knowledgeable staff. Very economical. Professional n cordial
Uninstalling UC due to recent poor service
Horrible app
Not working properly without membership
I booked appointment twice and both the times they were not able to assign the beautician, and till last moment they kept telling me that booking is confirmed, due to which i had to go to the event without waxing and threading.. pathetic service
My money had been debited from my account but there is no confirmation of booking
Professional didn't do things mentioned in application. When I reported issue with help center, executive listen to my complaint assured me to get call back after investigation. After that no call i have received it's been almost 24hrs now. Not at all accepted üëé
At the beginning the service was great, now its getting less professional, You need to control your staff, at the last moment we receive a call that you will( change the assigned staff or the arrival time )is not what I would expect, Hope you will fix the process.
My professional stolen my Bluetooth headphones And still the management are in discussion. She also impair my bed by wax. Very much bad experience.
They don't even have a notification option for refunds. Neither in mails, nor in SMS! It doesn't even show in the application. And nobody follows up from UC!! We have to request for a call back and check whether things which were promised are happening or not. Cannot even give a feedback on UC as a company for its disappointing service in their application. It only asks for the representative's feedback! Things must change, UC!!
Very good app for utilities service.
Professional on the time of arriving called and denied to complete it and no other beautician was available at the time and I wanted services that time and no one is available. Worst services. Before that in previous booking beautician came and spoiled my eyebrows and at time of payment she cancelled the booking so I can't put the feedback about it. Such worst beauticians and services.
You change my life thank urban company
Your new UI is too slow. Instead of adding heavy ui components, try to make the popup light and the details auto save compatible
Worst services
They write in discrption they are professionals but they are not realy professionals many problems other that I can found same services cheaper out more than them
This is the first time I used this app. Its really an useful app. Your men who attended the work did very well. I am totally satisfied. I will tell about this app to my friends and relatives also. In near future I will contact you when I am in need.
best service
Slots not available now a day
Very good
Good
I really don't know after updating the app they didn't show me the single facial choices earlier it is visible now there is no facials showing it..
Everytime one tries to book a slot for a spa session am always told no professional is available. This can happen once or twice but not evrytime/ different days. Even after becoming a plus member? Service is horrible.
these guys are great n professionals.
good
Worst app .. worst experience
I have taken the services of women's salon and massage both for men and women. The service providers are upto the mark and used the genuine products.
Nice app with all services
TV Repair- They have tied up with local mechanics in your area without any background checks. I booked for TV repair service and the so-called professional picked up my television set and returned back my original picture tube with a duplicate in non-working condition. The next day, I booked another mechanic from UC and he confirmed that the TV cannot be repaired as it was mishandled and not in its original condition. I raised multiple complaints to the UC team but all in vain. Had heavy losses.
the guy is very properly explain and done there work recommend for next time also
Have never used the app but read an article how they are treating their associates so a 1 star
Worst experience ever.. false committments are done..
Worst service
Third class service
Satisfied with the service
You show a slot to book for spa..and then you call to tell we have no person available at this moment..can you do it tomorrow..if I wanted it for tomorrow I would have booked it for tomorrow..if I would cancel you will take cancellation from me..but if you are cancelling then no gratitude to the customer for their time
The service is deteriorating day by day... UC makes us select Lux categories compulsory...reaching customer care is another task altogether. I am slowly thinking about shifting towards another resources.
perfect
very professional and courteous service
When I try to book a service it shows that the professionals are busy in my location and will notify when available. I don't know if they are providing service in my location. There is no customer care number available to contact as well. It would be more helpful if there is any customer care service number provided so that we can ask our queries to them.
Fully satisfied
very nice
Awesome UC...App Keep it up......
The assigned partner will call you and abuse if you rate them low for the service Very unprofessional
Very unprofessional behavior by urban company professional and app. I booked a service three days in advance. Service was cancelled by urban company at the last moment and I was not informed. I was told one hour before service appointment that slots are not available even though service was booked by me three days in advance. Service was rescheduled without my knowledge to a day and time which was totally unsuitable to me. My money was also not refunded despite multiple requests. Unprofessional!
good job
Don't promise to offer services at specified time if you can't honour it. It happens every time I book a service in the morning. And you guys make me wait indefinitely without any confirmation if the service will be provided or not. All I get is a consolation call from customer care executive which of course is of no use. I understand if it happens once, but the same thing happening repeatedly forced me to lose trust on Urban Company. Thanks for the pathetic service

Horribel
good service from UC. efficient and on time. very good experience.
Excellent as always...
Extremely user friendly application. Absolutely brilliant job guys. Keep up the good work. üëç
no response for complaint raised.. technician charged 5 times more than the market price..
I'm not happy with the professional Mr. Bhaskaran from coimbatore, TN assigned to me for bathroom cleaning. He was an hour late. I booked a slot at 3.30pm but he arrived at 4.30 pm only. He was extremely rude, impolite and unprofessional and yelled at my mom. I made booking for 2 bathrooms and he refused to clean the other one. Even the bathroom that he cleaned is not properly done. He used one of our bar soaps instead of the chemicals and the top of the geyser is not cleaned. Worst experience!
Only few good service PPL... Most are just after 5 star ratings.. kept getting calls to give 5 star rating..was almost to the point of harrasment...and the job done by the person was ineffective.
very good sir vk.sharma and rajan singh
Super
There is no urgent way to speak to the service team at UC, the service person is late and there is no reporting for delay on UC end...pathetic and shameful
Very expensive but not the happy
I have used the service couple of times and it has turned out well.
awesome services for women
Good
Good
Good Service. one thing need to improve is like if you provide rate 4 + therapist ƒ∫ist while booking the therapy..it will be very helpful for choosing best therapist.
excellent work
very good
Jio the job in this company üíùüíùüíùüíù
Thanks Urban Clap, in between lost trust in you but now with gr8 service as usual, m happy
I have been a regular user of urban company and not faced many issues. off late their salon professionals have become very ill mannered. I made a booking for a home salon service yesterday for 2.30pm today no call or msg from the beautician (Mamta). She did not pick my calls or replied to msgs. after escalation to helpline, she picked my call and kept saying 10 more minutes a d eventually refused service. Such unprofessional liars should be blacklisted from the system forever.
Oi motherchod company phone kor raha hai job hai bolke , app download kora raha hai , Rating barane ke lye, a motherchod company rating ka chakar p scam kor raha mobile p call korke, register contact number leke kya Ghar mara o geye?
Excellent
professional are always busy in my address.... when they are free.. i can't book my slot... always they said remind you when they are free
No customer care contact no in the app and on the website as well. Poor service when customer wants to reach urban company.
It's budget friendly but impression with first booking was not up to mark
Make you pay for a membership to save more then they increase their prices. They are more expensive (even with the 10% discount of the paid membership) than other companies providing the same service.
Excellent service rendered by shri karumaran. Keep it up.
The beautician take too much time to render the service
They do their work perfectly
Roll on wax was not good. Beautician tried very hard but wax couldn't work at finest like strip wax on fine hairs.
worst service and these people lie
Services are overpriced as compared to our local servicemen
Good
rates are very high
Rocking Service..super haircut, Refrigerator service..
excellent services
Most unprofessional and horrible company in india.had got my painting services done in kolkata .They charged huge amount with seepage solution and one year warranty services.My painting job was not done properly and seepage reoccured.Now they are not responding to my complains nor giving any solution.NEVER TRUST THEM AS THEY CHEAT CUSTOMERS WITH TALL PROMISES. After a month No callback or resolution after repeated complains on helpcentre.BUNCH OF FRAUDSTERS.
Wonderful salon service
Getting technicians for small work is challenging now a days. UC is addressing this by providing skilled technicians on time when in need!
Great experience scheduling and getting dad's haircut
Excellent
Amazing experience. Awesome customer care service. The salon services are worth every penny. Haven't tried the cleaning and maintenance services yet. Will update the review as soon as I do. Keep doing the awesome work guys!
I booked twice UB comp for salon work, and both the time it was disaster for me, the professionals have no idea about there profession, just ruined all my functions... Waxing not only removed the extra hair but my skin alsoüò°üò°üò°, left me with pimples and agony and pain. Requesting people never go for this urban Company if you have any important function to attend, they'll ruin everything
Best services.
from last 3 days they are playing some sort of games with me asking me to reschedule the appointment again n again
No customer care number to reach a personnel to askbmore details about a particular service.
Overall service is good but some professionals are dissapointments specially in plumber category.
URBAN company is the one & only place I can trust in getting BEST services. I have had the most satisfying experience with their service . Credit goes to their professionalism , best technicians + others whom I'm yet to experience yet I'm sure UC has a fabulous approach with a team of trained professionals. URBAN COMPANY HAS EASED OUT STRESS OF MANY I GUESS....JUST LIKE ME. URBAN COMPANY IS THE BEST PACE FOR ANY KIND OF SERVICES. I LOVE UC. THANKS UC.
Awesome Service!
Professional people
awesome service. you can blindly trust them.
Before they used to send experienced and good professionals now a days the professionals coming are horrible. They don't care about your skin and your health they just have to complete there work and go for another service. I have again and again trusted urban company in the hope that they might this time a good professionals but it's same with every experience. Waste of money.
good

As she brought everything as peaceful spa but I'm unhappy with urban clap description mentioned in app it's not the same as shown in advertisement no tool for spa used as per the tools used for parlours in professional way seems urben clap is charging more as I checked in the same with in parlour no discount no benefit not so very good as expected from urban clap fake adds unhappy dispointed Beautician was pretty good polite as she has done her duty.but as mentioned by urban clap in app was not
Ohk
To book a slot you take the time and also based on the slot charges gets changed. But at last moment say simply sorry and reschedule and also no refund procedure. Worst service and time punchuvality. Better walkin to some saloon and spent on spot.. I had booked a slot and I had a plan after the haircut but because of you I have to rush nearest local saloon and groomed up then what is use of downloading this app and wasting my mobile.memory
BETTER OPTION FOR AC SERVICING..
good service
good response from u c.
Begging for the 5 star ratings. Service is not at all good. Waste of money
showing rate double
The process of booking has been made difficult. too many packages confuse us. Kindly make one basic package.
Bad one they don't know customer time value any time they can cancel they can delay services after ur booking at last moment.
very good service
Don't ever book an appointment for pedicure. It's better to do from a local sallon. Had pathetic experience. Worst customer care they won't help you they are here to lotofying customers money.
Very poor service waste of money aug 30th 2021 I got my television serviced from urban company, professional has damaged my tv I raised a complaint but no response from uc now my tv is having display problem, again I raised a complaint but no one is reply very worst app ever
Team of very professional experts
Very bad experience,,was booked my appointment, was done my payment bt no professional assigned..and stil no refund in my account..be carefull guys
So, very good experience with overall service
ok
Bad
superb
Bad services or no services, that's all I have got from urban clap.
Very pro , clean , well groom and self sufficient service representative . Soothing head massage . Satisfied customer
Refund process very slow
Nice service nd Polite Service representatives
Response is good. I am not happy with the process and policy. Repaired my TV 4 months back by spending more than 4k with backlit LED strip change suggested by technician. The change was made offline and am not aware of the change of the quality of products replaced even my faulty products are not returned. With the 90 days warranty policy I am helpless. The same problem arised and I am unable to get any warranty and as per technician again to replace the same with 90 days warranty. Is it worth?
Unprofessional attitude. Cancels your booking abruptly..!
One of my friend is having a slot available at same place where I am booking it from his account. From my account, the slots not available. I want to share the screenshot of mine and my friend also. If you are not able to give a slot, pay my plus membership if you are not honest. Guys do not trust this company. They will fool us
Good
skilled n decent
Worst app.
No consistency in service, extremely disappointing!
Pathetic experience, service personal r not much experienced. Its being 5 days still facing trouble in the machine.
Best services
Very Good üòä
highly recommend
Very bad services unprofessional team work.. Please don't go for it
satisfied
Worst deep cleaning service, don't ever book. They keep changing time and don't come also machine service is fake, they do it by hand but charge premium for service
They provide false information about the clean up service they offer. Do not use this app it's a false trap.
Kuntal is extremely professional and courteous. Her services are perfect and she will always leave you with a lot of positivity with the way you look after her service
so expensive
Very good..
Really prompt and quick service
Very poor services, wastage of time and money, money gets blocked and no professional assigned and when launch a complaint they argue, worst app and services please refrain to use My money is blocked and not returned yet
Earlier they had an option to choose the same professional who has serviced before, now they assign a random person one hour before the scheduled time. I have to go through whole process of explaining issue from the scratch to the other professional. The app has become more complicated and not that user friendly anymore. I better call a nearby technician.
The services are very good. More search options may be provided to identify a service easily. For eg. I am unable to identify whether services are available for controlling Pigeon menace, mosquito menace, Almirah(Bero) repair etc.
Expensive

Do you run services in Trivandrum? Salon for Men shows professionals unavailable since the last 3 months!! Very disappointing!!
Excellent
Facing problem for login.Very good app need more services & professionals,
Worst service ever.. This is the second time they have canceled my booking even after confirming the address
First experience and it was bang onüëå
Very bad all the time it shows all professionals are busy and wont accept any service Then whats the point of giving ads telling download our app for better service like salon when no professionals can be assigned Worst app ever
Excellent support and resolution of matters.
7yeares
Urban Company is awesome forsalon at home in vadodara and Mumbai, however, there are very less services. For example no cartrige waxing and peel of rica waxing. Only honey and chocolate waxing available in Kota Rajasthan, why this discrepancy. It's high time you introduce all the services you have in metro cities to be replicated in Kota
Amazing and most useful app
Urban company has the most pathetic service. They would say book a slot and then never send anyone. They do one thing really well robbing people of their time.
I came here to book but after looking at reviews better to stay away
FROM A PREMIUM SUBSCRIBER: Worst experience ever. 1- Appointments are not accurate. For more than one time they rescheduled the appointment and made me change my plans. 2- Most professionals were slow. They couldn't finish a one-bedroom apartment in 3 hours. UNINSTALL ...
excellent
HEALTH HYGIENE PROMPTNESS AND CLEANLINESS.... Undoubted Choice...UC we see we all see...URBAN CLAP
Good work and well behaved. Superb sevices they render. To notch. Even company people wont do this quality.
My ac was damaged during servicing and Company is not changing the damaged part.
Very helpful
Pathetic
Again a bad experience salon booking was scheduled for 5 professional called at 4.30 and said she is not well so can't come and to reschedule. No appointment today had to reschedule it for tomorrow as the money was paid full. Unprofessional people.
Useless. I needed an electrician and from 2 days it cannot provide me one.
Professionals keep on re scheduling and Urban clap has no control over it.
polite and helpful staff
Biggest SCAM!!!!Handyman was late already I cancelled and charged me 25 aed for nothing!!!!!!!fix this!!!!then what's the purpose of the time scheduling???if they will not come on time then if they are late and want to cancel the booking I'll be charge ld for 25aed it's not my fault why they are late.
Totally mismanaged company....they are not able to deliver at given time slots and then they just apologize.Pathetic customer care service as well. Would never recommend urban company. They only make false promises.
She came directly on time. very friendly and works in a fast way. very happy with the service.
Worst experience I had in my first booking. I booked a service on Thursday for Saturday. Still they r not able to provide me professional. I told them that I have an event to attend. But just waste of time rather I wld hv prefer some other salon n pay more atleast I will get service in time. I wld hv given negative marks.
first time in three years of using UC app...I have experienced so well conducted work from professional.happy with the work.please maintain the best of the service.All the best.
good service
Excellent sofa cleaning.
promising services.
Very high price for electrician service
Minaz was excellent
7 days. 4 reschedules. Numerous apologies. The team at Urbanclap couldn't find me a single professional to service across each of those reschedules. Finally, I think I will step out and find a salon. Worst experience ever.
excellent
Very good app for all required service
No customer support
Very poor app and service experience
Worst service. Thank you for testing my patience.
excellent service, she is very polite and perfect service provider
saritha has very good professional knowledge
very satisfied
Excellent services from Urban Company
good
doesn't cover full Bangalore
Horrible experience.
Professionals don't turn up. You keep waiting. Refund takes weeks & months. You can't call anyone. You keep waiting for call back. You pay full amount at the time of booking but your professional will be assigned 1 hour before. There is no assurance whether somebody will turn up. This is the worst app
The person supposed to come cancels 2 mins before scheduled appointment. Why was my booking accepted when there was actually no spot open at all. Poor managing as far as I can see. I don't want to be using this service anymore
Worst customer support
Wrost service and charged more compare then market, totally time and money waste.
If you are looking for worst serive then go for urban company. I have booked pest control service but strugglinng for service to get complete since last 03 days. I have already paid money but they don't have any professional who can work. Last minute they are canceling appointment and call center people are informing after ind hour. Worst service üëç
I have been a plus member from some time now. But from last couple bookings it's been pathetic. Each time I booked the appointment 2-3 days back, but the day of booking no one shows up. They call and tell no one available for that time and you can book the appointment after 2 days.
Pathetic experience.. Booked a service two time and on both instances technician didn't turn up.
great
Excellent
Poor service - everytime it says technician not available...
Trying the app slots for last 3 months and unable to get any slot
The service is very poor and it has degraded to certain extent that they have started adopting illegal practices and unethical ways to make money. It's been 2 months, my Sony LCD TV was to be repaired as the screen was broken and the technician took 6days and he would do the work offline. After 6 days, when he didn't do any work, I reopened the ticket, he said spare is not available and exchanged my original product with some duplicate ones and TV is not working. They are not responding now.
Very polite, nd well experienced technician.
very professional and hygenic
hi p oh c cc
excellent service in such tough COVID situation, hats off
I have lived 10+ years in dubai and travelled the globe but never thought that i would experience such a bad service . one of their professional name shivam singh left the bathroom bucket on my kitchen gas stove and he did this out of revenge as i told him that he's not cleaning properly ...
I mean the app in general is okay but they have removed a lot of pretty commonly booked stuff from the Women's Salon section without any explanation so it has kinda made the app redundant for me.
In time services without any hesitation. There is no need to call several times.
My personal experience plz don't go with this app better call company vendor or local vendor..worst service ....
Nice service
Un experienced technician & less clarity
All the services by UC are very good. The team is expert in their services and work with dedication
I need a manager number as I had an issue with a thief maid of yours. They steal when they clean!
Excellent work done, very neat and clean, and done with lot of patience. Gud job .nice APP
Very nice app for people giving all services
Excellent Service
Worst quality Water Purifier
I had booked chef services from urban company, very pathetic service. Our chef subscription was completely mismanaged by UC staff(Mr Ashwin and Mr Sreehari). They forget to assign a chef often and we had to keep on checking with them every day. They stopped our service even when we had days left.. Mr. Ashwin is not responding and Mr Sreehari is not ready to hear. I have even asked them to refund my money, but no response. I strongly recommend anyone to NOT BOOK their chef services.
Worst service..they accept appointment and at last moment they call you saying no one is accepting. What a pathetic service..i being a member will not renew again. Your customer service sucks too. They care a damn and do not care about the issue at all.
Excellent job done
Pathetic service , If you guys don't have employees why to accept booking.
thank you
The best and reliable. Looking forward for more services in future from Urban. Would recommend to get work done from this company at all times. Staff excellent and professional. Very polite and respectful.
Very good
They are always late, service providors are rude. A service providor shouted at me because am asking to confirm the address as they were late for more than 15 minutes. He thinks it os ok to shout at a lady in UAE.
prompt service and good behaviour..
Don't book this guy..he uses all low cost iteams
very good quality, and availability during required time is best
I'm really being grateful to such a service like urban company cuz usually these kind of services are unavailable to common people, but can be achieved when UC is with us. I would like you to serve all over across the world(urban-Rural) as soon as possible. Thankyou to you always.
Worst experience. They just simply cancelled the booking at last minute. If you guys cant make it why making the customers to wait till last minute. Very very pathetic. I have to pay and still I have to wait for them and they will just simply cancel the booking at last minute....ugly
Good jop sir
Terrible service
The service quality has gone down since the last few months. Twice I noticed that the professional is assigned to you but they don't turn up and UC automatically reschedules your appointment without your knowledge or consent and that too at odd times. They don't even have the courtesy to call up and tell you that the Professional assigned cannot make it.
Nice
neatly cleaned I m satisfy
Lovely
Uninstalled. This is consistent poor & incompetent. Rescheduled multiple times and at the last moment asked to cancel as no one available for service. This is second time.
They burn my skin in waxing don't go for it and taken 1500 from me to burn my skin?
Professional and personaliz ed
good
It's amazing experience
Pathetic service... My sister in law booked a service and the beautician burned her face. She told the beautician that her face was burning but still she didn't stop finally she scold her and stopped the service in middle. They used local products. Girls be aware this is such a horrible experience she is still struggling with her face recovery.
We booked for AC service it is not up to the mark and more over it mention deep cleaning with foam wash but the technician doesn't carry foam they don't have proper comunication amongst them. No time management at all.
video consultation is an brilliant feature! saves time and money!!
Wouldn't have taken membership if I had known that they would add something like 'minimum order fee'. It's better to find someone locally.
good response
I booked the urban company cleaning services and they made a fool out of us. Bad service Do not use. COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY
prices too high
If it's 0 star I would like to give zero
Worst app I ever use Plz don't waste your time In this app I get one star only
Just awesome for overall services
Horrible experience in a row. I did a booking in two consecutive days for my aunt and me. We both had horrible experience with two professionals
thank you
7 years experience in five 9,s modular company,&my side manual wark carpenter, electric ,panting
Professional
Good experince
Just because not having customer care number.
A good array of service offerings. Timely and efficient service. Worth every penny.
Great service
Worst experience. This is the second time that I booked for the service and nobody assigned to me. I am try to contact them from last 3 hrs,but no call from customer care side also. They say that they give destess spa, but they first give you the stess than destess it. Pathetic experience. Not refunded the payment also.
Those who are residing in Vijayawada dont go for this.they are not able to provide ths services. They keep on calling and saying we didn't find the professional we are trying very hard and they keep on rescheduling the slot.this is waste of money and time
Good service
Don't waste your money. I got my geyser serviced from UC and after 35 days I faced same problem for which I booked the service. UC warranty period is for 30 days so on 35th day they did not provide me any assistance and asked to make new booking. For geyser, service is recommended once a year. With UC recommended service would be once a month. Wastage of money.
Good job mohd shareef
nice haircut
I have booked an appointment 2 days ago, now its almost 1hr of me waiting for some to get assigned after my scheduled time.
Excellent services and very useful for me
Better service and cost effective
Quick services
The new changes in the app is pathetic. In beauty section they say make ur package but funiest part they don't give options to adjust as per ur need. I booked for facial n waxing but I was not able to add pedicure in it. Pathetic changes.
Very good service
thank you so much team..amazing work
Worest service
I booked UC for washroom and kitchen cleaning but the person came to my place was untrained and unprofessional
Pathetic service from Urban Company. Do not fall for it. They are just commission agents. No gurantee of your hard earned goods. No professionalism at all. On 3/2/22, I booked for 65 inch TV installation using the app. So called their highly skilled technician comes and breaks the front panel, which is costing me 50K for replacement. Now, this world class Urban Company is neither ready to pay the repairing nor has the decency to revert to resolve the issue in last 7 days. Warning to all....
Worst service ever. They will harrass u like anything. My issue was resolved in 13 days and let me tell you , my issue was on "HIgh Priority". Like seriously?üòÇ Moreover 9 different persons called me from the support team and I had to explain the matter 9 times again and again. They are horrible. 95% of the professionals are horrible. One of them damaged my AC blades and another professional broke one of the spare parts. Not at all recommended. Choose wisely.
excellent
Very excellent
Excellent work
Very bed
good and trustworthy
Excellent app
perfect professional services. fully recommendable and economical too.
First impressions was really great and very supportive and knowledgeable team
I had a very worst booking experience today with uc and even customer support never bothered to call me and work on this but are ready to charge cancellation. This is ridiculous
good
Worst application used ever in my Life no coordination between the workers and company highly uneducated in there field
Very professional and sweet beautician
Good service
Every service needs minimum amount. It's annoying
The new UI is terrible. If you thought you were simplifying the UX with this new build, you're terribly mistaken. It's more frustrating, especially in the salon & spa section when you select a particular service which has 2 variations of it, then an overlay card pops up on the screen to select. God forbid you accidentally hit the back button, then you have to start building your package all over again cause it erases the salon package you built so far.
Services are ok ok but app is not working at all even we cannot able to login itself and no way to connect the team as well. Look like app is created by new developer team.
very excellent and punctual intime
good
Waste of time and money they are very unprofessional
Worst update of the app. Difficult navigation and they removed some services from the threading section. Earlier the quality of facials and clean ups were too good. Now it's degraded.
You can't contact urban company for any issues. Don't understand how to contact for any querry. Very big issue.
I am satisfied with the service.
Horrible layout/ Stupid features. IT IS OF NO USE BECAUSE STUPID PEOPLE MADE AND IT AND PAID FOR GOOD REVIEWS. SCAM.
Charges for plumbing work is triple times.better arrange a local plumber for 1 day if have many minor works. Urban company charge like anything.very bad charges
Best
Excellent job and professional experience
Rate is too much
Very disturbing and very bad services
Excellent work they are doing, i am impressed with this type QUICK support, Thanks to UC
They provide free credit, but then you cannot use all of them or pay using COD. The reason why I use COD in first place is because they rarely show and start suggesting inconvenient timings or simply not show at all...
very nice
Naam badalne se kaam nahi badalta, had a electric work done at home... it costed me almost double than local also no proper invoice been provided.
Good
No proper response and very bad customer care..
urban company is awesome. It is always at my rescue when I need the beauty service st my door step.
A very helpful app when you live in Chennai and don't know the language. This app has removed this barrier and connected with best of the services providers. Continuously using for last 1 year without any complaints and attractive discounts.
Bed services and staff is very rude
service guys didn't get cleaning cloth and folding ladder with them..I had to arrange something to reach the unit..but otherwise service is good.
Good experience
I have recently changed my device .but whenever I am trying to login in its not supporting Again and again same issue. I have already logged out from old handset. Installed and Uninstalled again and again
Must include more options in facial. Should also give more discount.
Ordered a "Deep" cleaning for bathrooms. Was expecting somebody arriving with machine scrubbers, foams and cleaners as shown in TV adverts. Got a chap with a bag. He did his best, but nothing deep about it. Very misleading. Dont go for it.
I booked a technician to repair my television he had completely damaged my television when i contact the UC they said they will be compensating for the damage done by the professional and ask me to by a new television and send them the gst bill . I bought a brand new television and sent my gst bill there mail but didn't get any reply from the UC i tried to contact them but there is no reply from the UC . Its only fit to clean the washrooms waste of other services A company dosent becomes big with out a proper customer service
after checking my colour quality I will rate urban clap as I feel wat they promise for paint material not the same what I wanted
They provide very good service and price also affordable
They will take booking and in the last moment they will call and tell there is no person for your service, if you book the service and wait for them finally they won't give any kind of service and customer care people just disconnect the call on your face. They are hopeless, pathetic service.
Its nice but overall it can be good the professionals can be more trained.
Very Professional and value for money
Great app for services
Good service
incredible services
Good job done

Worst Service Ever, they have damaged my wall of new property during AC installation, and they giving me a solution of 500rs and say we are closing the case. In service they mentioned 10,000 will be cover, they providing me 500rs for the damage of my property. What should, I do with 500rs? Guys it's fake company doesn't provide satisfactory solutions if professional may damage your properly they will keep toturing you. And then they will settled with 500rs where damage is done of 50,000
Pleasant
Pathetic experience. No customer care
I only want pinky next time
she is very very good I'm fully relaxed love the why is talk....üòÄüòÄüòÄ
Very good
carpet cleaning n bathroom cleaning was good from the company else the market guys eat brains to get the work done but urban was good experience
Superb
A one stop for all needs
Good company
Had AC service plan 3 times, now unable to book service from it. Cheaters
Excellent app
i was troubled after the booking as the cleaning was rescheduled many a times but then finally after the cleaning was done, I was happy with the standards. on complaining with the company, they took appropriate actions too.
Standard of services has been significantly dropped on the multiple services I booked recently as compared to last year.. Not going to recommend this toanyone.. Total waste of money..
Bad experience incomplete service provided
Exellent work done by Mr. Gowtam & his team. ( My house full cleaning work). Very Very happy.
The app is so pathetic. I can't see a refund amount at all. They refused to give refund back in account. Not acceptable. I m forced to use their services
Worst app update, the new app has so many bugs and unwanted options. And the options don't load properly. There are no slots for the whole day and it shows try to reload all the time.
No customer support, no one reply or call
Poor service, whenever I try to book a service it says not available. They send notification as so called experts available and if I try book then still no availability. Waste of time. Doesn't have basic feature of customer care contact. They delete our review and In resonse to this review they send email saying will resolve asap for name sake but no one contacts.
A much-needed service. Please also add Goa to your list of cities where you are operational.
Good person Karthik
Worst app. Not working at all .
Best app ever!
I m very satisfied with your service
They call and cancel the request at last moment without providing and reason, and doesn't reschedule the service for the same time. We infact have to wait for 5-7 business days to get money back.
excellent service. servicpersion is very cooperative and professional.
Unsatisfied. Product quality not good.
Good work
nyce service
Plz DO NOT send promo ads IF U cannot fulfill ... N not disturb user with Ur *****... Learn visiting Bengaluru how well they serve customers ...
great app
The app itself is very confusing. The cleaning professional will make a difference only if you live like a pig. Of your house is generally clean they will use harsh chemicals and stain your floors and fixtures. Also as a woman they just ignore your instructions... the beauty service which I used once was excellent (thats why I gave a 3 rating, otherwise I would give 1)... however cleaning services are just pathetic.... waste of money
awesome
Excellent Service
good service
Worst app ever
Many thanks to Team Urbanclap for the efficiency. You make life simple. Satisfied customer for the past 3 years. Going good.
Extremely professional service provided by Kavita.
Not user-friendly.
Worst service i ever get, they have damage my appliance and after that they refused to provide any service, i ll file a complaint againt this in consumer forum
Not in my location and showing ke ads...time waste
hassel free uninstallation.. good technician
Extremely convoluted and painful process to reach customer service.
excellent service
Did a very satisfying job
Not that happy with their bookings..they will accept but will arrive late spclly morning sessions
Awesome...
UC has really simplified life esp during the pandemic.. I really enjoy the salon services, home cleaning is also very professional
This is the worst app I have ever seen. There is no proper response from the whole team from Urban company. Once we have booked a service for washing machine, he said there is a issue with condenser nd resolved it and went away. Again within 10 days, faced the same issue. This time he came and removed all the parts and said he will return back. After few days, we called him, his phone was switched off and the team reverted back to us and informed that he resigned for his job and went away.Waste
There is a limit where you can overcharge for a repair. This guy from UC told me it will take 7000 and 2 day in his repair shop to replace the backlight in my TV. So I contacted LG. Guess what? It took LG person 3000 and half hour at my home to do the same task. UC person told me he would replace 10 strips but wouldnt do it at my home because then I would see that he is only replacing 3 (that is the max TV can fit) and charging me for 10.
Very useful app n nice servicing till now...go for it
Good app for strangers. whoever change the location. Perfect technicians. Nowadays technicians are not coming for petty work, in this case, Urban Company is best.
nice one
Good
superb and prompt service üëåbut the fact is the professionals are requesting to rate them 5stars and give good reviews.This is not fair.....they must not force and interfere . Please introduce female hair cutting professionals.
Extremely saddened by the proposals/description of the services and the business model of UC. I used it for the first time today and felt deeply manipulated. The charges are totally unreasonable. Plus the description of services given on application is highly manipulative. I had to pay extra 2x money of what I had already paid during the booking of the service. Truly saddened by UC and unstalling the application right away.
Terrible, I took salon service and they start pestering you for additional services. Also, they will insist you to call them directly next time, bypassing UC. And then they will stand on top of your head to rate them 5 star. I won't be using again in any way. Thanks
Best service apps
Super appreciated
Great work, urban partners are very neat and polite, in my view they finished work very neately, price also reasonable, they used non-irritating chemicals, totally all perfect , i suggest urban to others, my hearty thanks to urban, JAIHINDH
i am very much comfortable working with urban company
Salon service sucks literally ! There's no credibility on the company's part, different policy for different services no accountability, no concern for consumers well being they charge extra for convenience fee for COVID situation & then send a professional who was coughing throughout the service ! The equipment was dirty & faulty, inexperienced untrained dosent know the process of pedicure yet shows a rating of 4.6 ! Injured my foot caused bleeding. Didn't bother to offer any compensation.
I suggest that you give ads focusing on locations you provide the service in.
nice service
Needed to change the pipe cause it was rusted and since I was not home I booked your services. I did not know that just to connect a pipe from the geyser to the pipe line would cost me 800rupees plus the pipe 250. If the tecnition was so professional and I had already paid 250 for him come home visit why did he add 599 full service and cleaning in our bill? When all that was done was just bolting up ONE pipe!!?? 599 rupees to bolt up one pipe. So professional. Unnecessarily very expensive
I'm happy about Aslina Ali service, she is having patience, makes me comfortable.
Professional service. The helper came well ahead of time and her work was perfect
nice work and Respectful technicians..
This is the worst service company you can see. They are fooling Indians. Once things goes wrong like your product is damaged by the technician thn you will die asking for help but they will not respond and put everything on the technician. Please don't get fooled.
Superb service..Thanks to Rajesh sharma for the excellent guidence..
ok
excellent app
good
I paid using gpay, however could not add a credit card number, it flagged the number as invalid
Pethatic service. We took services for bathroom cleaning. Professional locked washroom door and came outside with broken exhaust and outside shutter. As services were prepaid we couldn't do anything except complaining of the same to customer care executives. Since two weeks we got a call from customer care executive telling us that issue will be resolved soon. After 15 days got call telling us request has been denied.
App experience is good. Please include car cleaning service
very useful app even though the rates are a bit more.
Amazing Service üíì
overall consistently great services!
Very useful app. The technicians are good and professional.
I called a guy from Urban clap for washing machine as the front door was locked . He said to break the lock from the top and gave the quotation of around 1800. We had a washing machine of IFB & he said he would bring the lock of IFB only. Then later said it's hard to find IFB parts, but promised he would bring the same part but without IFB Logo, which was clearly misleading. Today we called a guy from IFB and he charged just 880 in which 590 was service charges and lock cost just 291
Very good.
Alert: Please think before book. Worst service ever. Not recommended. I faced a huge issue and dont get any response. Now they will reply here but nothing will happen.
Hey Urban Company, You guys are really great. I have used your application and never found any kind of disappointment. As a feedback you guys can go ahead and add a feature related to computer related issues. Like you send engineers or repairing guys for Refrigerator or Washing machines, I would request you guys to have a computer and its peripherals repairing person such as Laptop battery support, Printer repair support, Router issues, computer lagging issues, etc. WFH is still on.
INcase for any query, CUSTOMER SUPPORT NUMBERS aren't mentioned...my last experience with carpenter was not appriciatable.
You change the ladies in all your services to non-professional ones .. this is a waste of time and money
Plumber Booked for Service , But He never Bothered to pickup call and update about the time and details - Urban Company Not worth for emergency purpose
If you are not able to serve me on my location then why do you keep bothering me with notifications and messages. Its like inviting me and then denying the service. Absolutely disheartening. Please correct this bug.
everything was perfect
Not able to see the option of booking facial. Pls check the issue.
excellent
Worst app
very good service
I updated the app now. It's not loading properly. Please fix the same
Excellent experiance and good services
it was great!
They won't respond to issues
Their customer service is easy to contact and is willing to assist with any issues. They are understanding and willing to work with you. One of the best things for me was their reminder system about the appointment. Very helpful. I have used this service twice and I definitely recommend to others.
great service app.
Very good
V bad experience they keep cancelling my appointment
Very bad experience using urban company as its the third time i am denied salon services that too they do not notify earlier after the sheduled time has passed they just call to reshedule
Good experience
So called Professional only clean the washroom if it is good looking, so that they can complete it quickly and make a run. I have booked it for 4 times and every time their is a delay or they will not show up without any information. You can get a Prize for worst service. Kudos
Executive Sangeeta service was excellent üëå
Badüëé
Great app and excellent services provided by team. I do wish for a place to be able to ask questions , even if a bot.
It was very nice service by technical expert on video call and he have good knowledge about washing machine and he diagnose issue in washing machines very quickly. I am very much satisfied with the service. Thanks urban company and team.
service is excellent super washing and cleaning
request call back option should be upfront on help centre page
excellent service, good commitment, staff very polite and arrived in time hats off to CEO of urban company wishing you all the best in your future endeavours
Excellent
Not bad
Your personnel are asking for payment in cash instead of online payment. And bill is also not showing in app itself. Is it right way of working recommended be urban comp.
I liked the way service provided. I repaired Fridge, Microwave and Geyser. I got on time service with accurate cost estimate. Really happy to use this platform and recommend others also to use.
Very poor service company or a company that cares least for their clients. They provide you with slots to book the service. Unfortunately, no one calls, nor is any professional assigned for the service till the given time and here we are, eagerly waiting for the service guy. You complain. Nothing. You ask them to call back. Nothing. We are here, waiting for our service and the company just does not care. Finally, when I cancel the booking, UC makes the issue resolved and lives happily ever after
Good for adding skilled professionals
This version is to high battery üîã issue Everyone facing some issues plz change the version
No one to come at on time he (urban clab) says today not possible will assist you today?? This is really worst service by urban clap
best service
Very good services by uc
Worst experience ever...first i had booked appointment for the sane day and then no proffesional arrived even after waiting for 4 hours then later next day i booked one more appointment again i waited for 6 hours and still then then say sorry can we reschede for tomorrow?? Worst services,worst app dont waste your time on this guys absolute watage of time !
good service
app experience is very good. rates are but high but worth it.
Worst services, Not hygienic and no sanitisation
great service
good service and optimal prices
This app used to be good now it's just a terrible waste of time. Extremely dissapointed. The technicians since my past 3 experiences are never available and are always late. Time for a relook perhaps Urban company!
Not at all helpful, Damaged my washing machine and not did refund or service. Very unprofessional. If the product from the brand is not procured by them it's there mistake. If this is the service then I recommend people to take from direct brand service centers to get the appliances service. Waste of my time and money, top if that membership also I have from them which I will not be using if no step is taken from the urban clap company.
Interface is very bad.. Unable to pay and order many times.. It shows price updated and restrict the order placement.
All good except one of my booking were not assigned professional due to which I need to reschedule
They take booking and then technician calls and cancels the booking if customer doesn't agree to technician's demands of slot and price change. Customer service people are rude and condescending.
Bath f loor is not that much clean. Side walls are partially good. Cleaners talking nice and mentioned it will be 80% cleaned remaining will cleaned in the continuous cleaning.
I love UrbanClap because of it's easiness and the service that they provide. I have used their AC service, beauty and wellness service and both has been one of the best experience for me. Whenever any work related to household or personal care comes in mind UrbanClap is the one-click app that I use. Their massage service is tremendously good.
You just removed facials from the basic services. Why would I even use your app if I can't a complete monthly beauty care package ?
excellent services
Quality of service provided by Water purifier agent is not upto the mark. Within 3 months filter is being replaced.
App is not user friendly and too rigid. I want to book a service for multiple people, like booking massage for 2 people at the same time. I dont under why i should book one appointment at a time. Make your app more functional and introduce more functions.
nice service
good
I can't see facial service in the women's salon service I am using UC from 3-4 years it never happened. Is facial service available with UC or not
Not good The service for furniture assembly was listed as 600 The person arrived and said it's not possible to do the assembly at this rate and demanded that i pay 1800. So i asked to cancel the order. Then he demanded 200 ruppes for nothing. And asked me to cancel booking on my own. Better to rely on local carpenters
Never find any professionals near sompura gate
I rated a professional low on the app as I was genuinely not satisfied for that particular time. Surprisingly it seems I have been banned by urban company to book any further. My booking goes till payment only to end at Sorry something has gone wrong. Don't understand why and this is very upsetting for a regular customer who has given you so much business.
Seriously the service charge is so much that even getting a Premium Membership is useless now
Nice
nice... excellent cleaning
Carpenter & hair cut is excellent, but plumber behaviour is not good... however excellent service from UB Clap
awsm service provider app
Hey folks! Trying to save all of who reads this with a request to not go ahead with Urban Company, I have been into a really terrible experience with them and they won't support you even in the case of 'harassment' I have been harassed by one of their professional as she started to gimme calls at 1:30am in the night asking me why did I booked her thru app & not privately, im not kidding, Imagine i was loaded with alot of calls & msgs with different numbers, read more on bigger platforms, its BIG
I have book a service today for 6.30 pm no response from uc finally i cancelled the booki g.. but got the message that i will get refund of only 519.. why... I paid 649 .. its ur mistake u didnot assinged the beauticiam by 7 .30pm. Why am i penalizes .. pathetic Service Dated 5feb 2022.. Again same thing happen as above.. If u can't provide service y r u even open?.. Pathetic just pathetic service..
I have changed my rating from 4 to 2 over a period of 2 years. I am so unhappy with the services they offer for Salon services (women). They need to train their staff better and ensure the services match the quality they assure.
I want to know is facials clean up services are stopped ? I can't see them anymore. Please revert
excellent service
Worst service... I had a booking for today but professional not assigned at that time so I was told to rescheduled ... Even after rescheduling I had no professionals to attend.... Bookings unhappy
Bad experience with my tap service and repair. No experts they hire only local cheap people. After urban clap service wall in which tap fitted that is totally dampness and my wall color is damaged.
Great dedicated work.
excellent relaxing massage by Nitin
Excellent service and response.
Horrible service. Absolutely 3rd class. These people are here only to loot money.
It's great
I am disappointed after paying club membership I am being charged convenience and minimum order fees. Otherwise performance was excellent.
Not able to scheduled booking details. Update the app also
Prompt and efficient service.
This new app update is so confusing and clearly.shows how greedy you have become. From a simple, quic and honest booking ...I see 100s of options to confuse customers, charging for each small thing like 1 min ear clean up during haircut just goes to show how difficult is to just book 1 haircut. Revert back to simplicity and honesty else in a normal world, I sure am back to go to salon closeby.
Not good service. The professional was not skilled. They take extra money
very convenient
Good service @ home.
More then 100 % margin charged on electrical parts for washing machine and other equipment. I am very disappointed by the urban company. I also take the membership from long time.
single source solution for all your needs.
Taken double amt and not returned even not acknowledged.
Good professionals and quality service. Thanks to Urban company
Nice..
Very very bad experience.. They don't even provide a proper service..its just a waste of your time.. No proper response and do not resolve out issues.. And mainly theirs no point of contact provided..
This app do not include customer care no. To contact
send skilled professionals
Very very bad experience for me... service experience apart they don't even provide a service properly very very disappointing
Basturds. They will take the money first and then will tell the service is not available and that we must wait for 5 days for refund. This is a fraud company. Saaley chor kahi ke. Fraud. I will never ever use urban company till the time I am alive and will ensure my friends and colleagues knows about it and they should also avoid using your fraud services.
Price is very high
Everytime professionals are late. This time by half hour ..not worth the money. Last time I booked a hairservice and none was assigned until 1 hour prior and they call at 7:30Am in the morning to just tell me that there is none available. They work as per their time preference and not customers. Just not worth the money
good
I have requested two times. First service us very good. But second one it's incomplete. He didn't do one service in my list of services.
satisfactory
Bohut hi zyada best hai urban company sare kam ghar pe easy hojate hai.
Worst services, twise professional not assigned properly, one time forced me to cancel my booking
awesome App
It wont allow to sign in/up because of daily otp creation limited error
Very well trained, well behaved, skilled workforce. Contact numbers to speak are not readily available on app. Should be clearly shown and made available handy and easy to notice like other information.
All is Well
Service not available in madurai smart City. Increase your people strength.
Great hair & beauty service professionals. Happy with their home beauty services:) Would love to have continued collaboration with Urban Company services. Thankyou for training your staff well & onboarding the rt professionals:)
Waste service s
Great service
They are not professional
The prices these people quote for repairing appliances is insane ! Will never use for electronics repair !
Services are too bad n high charges and if you raise the complaint they are not able to give resolution. From urban clap other apps facilities as well as charges are good n fine .
good ....... excellent....
Avoid UrbanComany for IKEA furniture assembly. There is no point to having a price list when all your people come and argue about the price(just because they know IKEA assembly starts at 3500). They should also know that I hired a day laborer for 800 and got all my IKEA furniture done although I had to instruct. UrbanCompany - Either fix your rate list and don't mislead customers to book IKEA assembly through you or tell your staff to work at the price committed.
Professional has refused to deliver the service he cancelled my booking he didn't tell me anything
Fully satisfied
You charged extra for immediate visit. But you could send only on the next day
Unable to make a booking. Wondering how this app had 4.6 another suprise is my previous review went missing
0 star rating app because of service is not available in my area
nice app
They accept the bookings and then they can't assign the professional on time.... Even after giving several chances for redemption they misguide you saying they would reach out to you in 30 mins which turns to 1 hour....Very Unprofessional.... And then they connect call through different department and give nothing but an excuse which doesn't make any difference.... U can't rely on them..... Thorough disappointment....
My experience not good. My sofa is not clean as I thought. Stains are still in sofa.
Awesome
i made service request to repair refrigerator single door. The technician has done the repair in a perfect way but the price charged for the parts is so high in comparison to the market price. The price is not to be fixed as per the rate card and is required to be comparable or at par with market price.
Very Nice
fix rate are higher then normal
Best for local household services and repairs.
Very unprofessional labor and even more unprofessional support executives. Even after 2 hours of raising complaint, support team didn't even care to respond.
Excellent service üëç
Had wonderful experience
I wonder what's wrong with UC, I am not able to place my order because when I try to make a payment it shows "Something went wrong", In each payment method. Please sort this issue. I am not able to find any customer care tab In app.
Its utter nonsense to book a service from these guys. They are just another scam and customers have to go through hassle of calling and verifying service details. They happily ignore complaints by repeatedly asking same qtns from multiple executives despite clearly goofing up by not providing service as per the details mentioned on their app. BEWARE BEFORE YOU TAKE THEIR SERVICE AS THEY WILL TAKE YOU FOR GRANTED. AND OUR COMPLAINTS ARE JUST USELESS.
Helpful
most inexperienced and ridiculous engg they have
A very convenient app that has everything you need in one place.
Getting sick of this app. They keep raising prices. And the new update won't even let me pay. Why don't you test the updates before launching?
Worst app.... How u can assign a male professional for female client.... Ridiculous.... Nd ur customer care people are also so rude... I complained so many tyms but issue not resolved
rates shown for any item installation is nominal but extra charges are too much. like they said emergency charges whereas technician visited after 24 hrs , that too we didn't opted timings, it's app showed timings. whatever hidden charges are too much
so good service...i am satisfied üëç
Good
5 stars
Open nehi ho raha hi
Rates have increased rapidly....even on festivals no concessions and new update doesn't have the feature of facial in salon at home
Excellent
Good
excellent work with patience
very reliable work I will recommend their service to evryone
They provide all time new assistant.. i want my old service provider suggestions.
I'm NOT satisfied with UC. The professionals aren't trained as they are claimed to have been by the app. They don't have a sense of hygiene. The bags, cleaning supplies, cleaning tools and products are very dirty. We don't know where it has been used previously. The kind of chemical being used is very suspicious, harsh and inappropriate. They don't even know what kind of brush to use and end up damaging the surface. Yet they charge a lot of money for which the service isn't even half as good.
For plumbing, automatic motor no adequate skilled labor available
wonderful
Very bad service
too expensive charged me 45aed per hour !
Working is good
Excellent service
Nice
good service
keep up the great work Team UC
excellent job done by Ajith & team
Good
Very Professional Team
Bad
good
Very happy with UC, expert technicians, good service, and the attitude of the service person is always polite.
super
I have being using UC for more than 3 years now and its regularly every month. With each new update the basic functionality of the app is getting worst. I don't know if it's change of management or person but whatever it is guys you initial app design was way better that what you have today in simple terms it was user friendly.
service is very good, one star less because service is little bit pricey
They are not assigning good professionals these days. Everytime you have to reschedule it with new professional. They must check the reviews of professional and they assign to customers. There is always confusion with the bookings even after rescheduling the booking. Even after asking for new professional they rescheduled it with same professional.
Very bad and pathetic service.I had booked salon services,no one appeared and even customer care was not reachable.Waste of time and money.Very pathetic and frustrating.
They are professionally trained with all equipment required in hand .
very good work
Price too high.
Service never upto mark and not the big money we're paying. I've contacted the help center and my ticket is resolved without assistance. UC ppl do not use the solutions provided by the company.Very disappointed despite paying such big money. The professional hired today was arriving half an hour late. Can't accept
Great app, great company, great services!
Complaint redressal is horrible
I had good experience with UC, so I paid for membership.. But suddenly they removed my regular Wine Facial from solo booking and have put it only in package.. UC I had booked for membership only because I do this facial every month and if you are not providing me facial service then there is no use of membership for me ...
Worst experience, my booking was cancelled after waiting for professional to arrive, you guys are wasting time of customers. If can't deliver the service why you take the booking and make customer to wait. Shame on you
Satisfied with service. good staff sometimes below average but mostly we get good professionals. Certainly better than other apps providing similar service
good service
Nice
UC is good platform
Why would we pay for training ur assistant
awesome service every time
Bike mechanic service chalokoro
Great service..very professional and hygienic..cost is also good but varies from city to city..everyone should try once..
Cleaned very well & Staff is polite
very nice, hygienic n professional
Wrost app I will never use this app or never suggest anyone to use this
For 2 days, I was trying to find an electrician who could come home and fix my broken geyser. The local electrician said he would come yesterday but did not turn up, got frustrated following up with him. Thank God for this app I was able to book a Geyser Servicing Technician who arrived at my home well before time and did a great quality work. Very helpful app. Keep up the great work !
Disappointed with the workings of the app. It's been showing incorrect track data. For example I had payed the appointmented person both the times before through cash on spot but the app still shows status to be unpaid. Being a regular customer of Urban clap it's rather frustrating when you provide me with averagely rated beauticians beating the purpose of me using the app ie to recieve the best.
Very very bad service
Great app for all in one solution.
good
Maintains cleanliness, hygiene.Safe to choose urban clap as service man are vaccinated. He comes on time and do service professionally.
Facial options are not available. It is rather surprising that I'm not able to find facial options on the app. Also, customer care is completely useless.
Very nice.
Good üëç
Why i cant access this site !!!!!!!!
Very poor , the biggest issue I m facing is not able to contact customer support and people who did Washing machine repair at my house are not picking
Very bad experience not menairs
Very user friendly app. within a sec or time the request is submitted and the technical person contact you as soon as possible and the service they provide is best and very professional way. thanks for wonderful services for urban company team and associated worker with them. thanks
Good and very useful service
Urban company is not trustworthy for works especially electic related. Most of the staffs have unprofessional behaviour and don't even know the basics.
I have used service for pest control and sad to say that while process was a waste of money and effort. The cockroach were back the very night. I thought it will take a weeks time for these to vanish but sadly I am still struggling to keep the pest away. Worse they don't even have a customer care nos to call back and report.
Professionals are good,but company policies are very low standard..
Just checked and told part needs to be changed and charged 450 without doing anything.
Good
Service is very poor, even after booking thrice and raising complaints, neither their employee picked the calls nor did they come to fixe the issue. And their water purifier product stopped working within 2.5 months ,after paying heavily even after having warranty and water quality was compromised both in taste and smell. Could not replace the product so far because of no response to the issue. Badly frustrated and unhappy with the urban company. I have lost trust and faith in its services.
Booked for deep cleaning of bathroom he said only 50% will be cleaned.
very proficient service team
worst app ever.I tried to book appoinment but the app is not letting me to pay in anyway.
service was very good.
Unprofessional staff... They take booking and inform to reschedule at the time of reaching your place... I rescheduled it based on the staff request but next day the professional didn't turned up and cancelled it without informing me... Would suggest not to buy plus membership... It's not worth it.
Chor company! Never use them.
very good service looking for keretin too
very professional and experienced persons. had a good experience. worth spending on Urban rather on unskilled persons
Nice aap
Worst service from UC, everytime they are accepting slot bookings and at the time of service they are rejecting due to technician not available, same thing happened to me multiple times, they are rejecting refund of membership fee.....
Service is good but few categories are very expensive
It was great experience
Good
Interface is very confusing with too many unclear options. Clear detailed description of all services is not available.
Its waste of using urban clap service. This company hires all unprofessionals they dont know what they are doing and spoil the product
over priced
There have been no slots available for the last 7 days. Pathetic service providers. Absolutely rubbish
nice
very good work coverage was total
Very bed pls don't use this application
I recommend you to DIY if you can. Most of these guys who come to fix are untrained and honestly plain stupid. The fixings was of sub standard quality. The guy didn't fix the cap of the fan correctly and the wires can be seen dangling behind the fan. I am buying my own Bosch kit and will never book urban company again. Even the Carpenter fixed the rods with a much bigger drill bit and the anchor came out with the screw without any tugging on a concrete wall. The guys have no common sense.
Very bad experience each time i make a booking..not sure how you guys are sustaining in the market.
anu prajapati
Nice
urmila's service is was very satisfactory , thnx
Service wise good. Spare charges are very higher side specifically for appliances. Seamless service but not value for the money.
recently I had booked for bathroom cleaning n believe me uc dis a fabulous job
Amazing service , polite and professional.
Needed such kind of service in our country, no hassle and you get your money's worth
Therapist not available most if the time
Nice idea. Keep it up.
its a nice and perfect service..
Do not maintain timings. Charge a lot for convenience and minimum fees.
good service and good behaviour
good service
thermostat prices are very high comparing to local market price
VeryGood
very good
Not able to book appointment..button is greyout... Wasted my time :(
Good
The wash service UC provide. Just always monkey oriented business & customer service nothing.
I got a good experience from UC. Thy are giving a good learning platform to grow your feature. Thanks to UC.
üëç
The app was not well developed for after service feedback. There is no submit/send bottom after typing my feedback.
This was regarding the pest control services which I opted for last month. It is not at all effective even after a follow-up service. It is such a disappointment to see the situation back to zero. No effective results at all. Do not opt for pest control services.
System makes bookings on its own and the app is hard to use if u need to make any comments /complaints
why premium service not included in classic
Your services are really good and usefull. However, there is a suggestion I would like to make please inlcude other brand products as well or a choice for user to bring their own products for the service. It would boost user experience and your business. Currently we have to avoid using your services if we do not have the products which suit our skin. There is a very limited range of products to choose from and if they are not our ideal choice we have no choice but to avoid using your services.
Great
Good work
Awesome..
Fraud company hai 20% ke kar 40% Leti Hai technician ko loot rahi hai
puntual services
Booked a Full Home Cleaning service. The service person brought 2 untrained guys with him and they were horrible. We had to literally point out the obvious cleaning spots for them. UC: Define your policies clearly and description should also be very precise. I just wasted 5k on full home cleaning and it sucked.
This was the first time I opted salon at home manicure&pedicure package. Ms. Elvira and her colleague gave me a soothing experience. Loved the way they did the job.
Good and safe experience. All technicians and beauticians are experienced and professional.
very good service. impressed.
Thanks Urban Clap for attending my problem and renewing my faith on you
Worst service , I booked one hair cut appointment - service person came and he left with silly reason ( it's a residence and not home - customer care ppl also given the same silly reason ) Instead of wasting my time better to go to a saloon. Safer and best way
congratulations
she was wonderful
It's a very useful app which provides best salon professional service for facial, waxing, threading etc. Except Body Message. The Body Spa sply Winter special is really not good. The bed get more heated up and warmness couldn't be controlled. Also very less time provided for Message.
I find , there was almost no work to do but charges were too high
Good service
Very unprofessional attitude.the service personnel did not turn up at the scheduled time and said I am cooking food .can't come right now.when complained at the UC customer care , said we are sorry and will speak to personnel.Thers is no revert till now .moreover replied that they won't be able to reverse the membership amount as system does not allow reversals .highly unprofessional attitude.
staff has done a great job.on time service
I used to like your services, but lately I've been disappointed. You are sending non-professional cleaners. Every time they break something or spoil it. The last time a cleaning lady broke down my front door. I'm not going to use your services from now on.

It 8s just flee 8ng money from the customers and also the technical staff who comes for repair. There is no way to reach the customer care once your job is not done correctly. It tried to claim the warranty but all the time it displayed the message, there is some technical problem, please try later. I tried consecutively for 3 days but the claim warranty didn't work. So for the job for which I paid 1700 for the first time, ended up paying 2000 more for the same job. This is really disgusting.
Service rendered here is too good
Very good app
very good
Bad experience with the beautician ... Improper and half done jobs ...
Executive who came to clean my sofa kept all his cleaning equipment on my new coffee table which got stained..very irresponsible attitude..will never opt for UC
I Booked Monthly cleaning package, first month it was ok.. but in the second month maid only visited two time. And she was absent for the full month. And replacement was also not arranged. When I asked for the refund.. they simply ignore my request. Worse customer service and bit time cheating..
great service..and all the workers are very good
Have well trained service partners.
Too costly
Good service
good service
Best service and reliable
Useless company useless peole
Ok
wonderful app and services. Easy to book and great concept.
It's very good company excellent keep going üíØ
Vary vary bad
MANIPULATING COMPANY NOT URBAN COMPANY SELECTING LOW CLASS SERVICE PERSON CHARGING FULL AMOUNT
Extremely poor service. Confirmed booking of the cleaner at 15 45 pm for 7pm. Cleaner did not show up. Agent at Urban Company called me a liar, saying I never confirmed the booking. I recommend using Just Mop. Much better service.
No way to contact, no call, chat option for customer care
Excellent
Excellent. The entire process was smooth & neat. Thank you üëèüëèüëè
I got AED 30 as reward for next booking. While making next booking I'm able to redeem only AED 15. Im unable to redeem AED 30. Prices are increased comparing to earlier.
it was very nice and nice attitude of sir asif thank you
Absolutely nonsensical services by the persons . Extremely unprofessional work and attitude.
üëç
UC system showing incorrect address details when 'current location' option is chosen. If details entered manually it cannot be 'saved'. Have reported this repeatedly, but no solution from UC
yes nice service
It helps me everytime when i need anything.
It's very reasonable nd amazing
awesome App
Excellent service by mohsin really appreciated
Very bad customer support...no proper professional regarding allowance repair.may be they differentiate according to the booking.They r rude too
Pathetic service
The Worst, Wasted Money...They charge so much and do nothing...all whatever they say on the website, is all money making business... People like us call these fools and pay them for doing worst job than a house servant... balcony clearning means they will clean the full balcony with the window classes and the grill...but they charge Rs 199 for only cleaning the floor and nothing else...this is what I say , is a waste of money...and there is no contact number also for them...
fellow was good at work
Pathetic service. Not reliable at all, especially in an emergency.
Good array of services done by experienced people! Enjoyed the mani and pedi service at a reasonable price!
price is too high
wonderful service experience.. easy to use app.. everything transparent.. very quick response
gud work nice
This app is not working properly on bookings anything.anytime he is updated to show.how many times update this app.
Amazing service
very nice
Nice app . Needs sone improvemnet on the staff provided.
They will assign personnel again and again but nobody will attend you.
Nowadays Urbaclap gives more importance to service personnel than customers. Bcz of this service persons adding their own conditions to provide service. ( ie. I will charge Rs100 per drill eventhough in rate card it's mentioned Rs165 for 6 drills. I will not drill inside tiles. etc.) And you hv choice to cancel order by paying cancellation cost or you hv to agree with their terms. Customer care team also back them. In long run urban Clap will pay for this as so many customers has lost faith.
Service is no doubt good and professional but the service rates are high and illusive. I mean a bathroom cleaning should automatically include the toilet seat cleaning.
I'd give a -10 if possible, not sure how their services can be so bad. Over the last 18 months used them thrice. 1 - Home cleaning, terrible work, ‚Çπ400 in cash stolen. 2 - Plumbing, the guy who came damaged the plumbing. 3 - Haircut, two reschedules & I wasted two days. Stay away from this platform, they have no control over their vendors/service providers, they are just floating around on investor üí∏. Top it all, no documented way to deactive ones account, sign up on your own risk.
Very nice
Excellent service and truly experts you are. Appreciate
There seems to be no response from customer care. They are unreachable for any queries. The customer care has a standard response ....REGRET It has been 6days that I have written to the resolution team, and no response has come.
experience of hair cut with urban company is good
I choose custom repair and installation wjich costed me 219 rs. Additionally the electrician asked me to pay 200 rs for labour charge + material. I called service centre they told me 219 is just the booking charges . Which meant I paid 400rs extra apart from material. UC is just looting money in the name of booking charges which must be given to the labour as labour charges.
Very very poor experience repeatedly... Very very poor customer service and their unprofessional executives.. They first take bookings made then look for professionals... And then their professionals ditch because they r working directly with customers due to poor policies of company.. Shameful and regretful urbancompany.
Great services
I have changed my ratings to 2 stars now. Urban clap is unable to find me a professional to clean my bathrooms, the executive called me several times to tell me that they are unable to find me someone to clean the house and asked me to reschedule. I only have Sunday for cleaning and stuff and it is obviously not possible to reschedule on any working day. This has happened to me twice now in 5 days. Utterly disapppointed. Unistalling the app, urbanclap sometimes is useless.
Rates are too high
Good
Makes life so convenient. I've tried many services in urban clap. From home cleaning, to salon to massage to carpenters. It saves you the pain of having to go outside and hunt for these services. Moreover, we are informed about vaccination and temperature of the agent coming home which we do not get to know outside.
good service
This is 1st time i tried UrbanClap and found very efficient and professional. Expecting same will be continued for years
Very Good UC
All in one service app
Why don't you provide your contact details mobile numbers for Ludhiana CENTRE
mast
Have services have been removed and classic salon u have removed threading for chin , slidelocks & upper lips ... with new updates. We are indirectly forcing to take prime or luxe salon for the services with rates 3x time more are not satisfying instead of including u guzz are excluding the services that not right.
Satisfactory Service !
Hair Cutting service requires a separate kit for each customer....The Black mat should be more bigger to cover a more larger area so that there is no cleaning required and it will be less messy...Rest all.services are good.
very good
Unable to add address. I installed the app today, paid membership fee. Next i tried to order some service, but unable to add address. The keybord in phone is not popping up when I tried to enter the address by clicking on address field.
My urban clap experience in Bangalore is extremely good....from cleaning, CCTV installation and what ever services I asked for...extremely professional people , well behaved and on top of deliverables quality..however I am sorry to say services in kolkata are equally pathetic...quality of work is horrible.. am not sure if people I connected with for CCtV services are like this...but I would not recommend urban clap services in kolkata..and I will never proceed with UC services there...
I don't get slots to book at all. There is no professionals available even in the prime location of the city.
I had booked UC for hair styling..Sapna from sapna makeovers is just awesome..she has done a fantastic job üòä
The professionals are never available in this app.
Good service
Provide manual dark theme selection.
Thank You Urban company ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Worst complaint resolution, they can replace complaint ha doing executives with auto bots. They plainly deny to your complaint citing company policy
The Urban Company coordinates well as per the requirement and timely manages the schedule appointments.
Excellent so far
App is easy to use and very satisfied with quality of work done by them.
Overall superb.... A great service and fully satisfied...Really it is worth for the amount paid.... Thanks a lot keep it up...
some simple works get so much of price
over priced
Why you are taking money even before providing the service?
Good Prompt.
good
Useless app. All the people come here to find way to spin money then provide good service. Especially ac tech... They have locals with tag as "Professionals" these buggers only find ways to ***k money then fixing issues
Extremely poor experience,tech issue resulting in people more than 2 hrs
Pathetic Serivce . Being UC plus customer you have lots of privilege like your assigned person will not pick your call ,will not turn for providing service. Cc executive will ask you to cancle and will talk like they are the owner of organization.
Non technical staff , unprofessional staff
I waited for services entire day but no one came. They were keep reschedulig the booking. I have booked plumber to get repair my flush. You can imagine how difficult to saty without flush at your home entire day.
ok
The app just take bookings for salon. I've tried the app as well as the website. What's the point of the app if it won't take bookings?
Don't ever buy their membership. Took salon service, experience was good but this rating is for their category amendments for salon services. Previously it was good. But now according to them, if you want beard trimming it only falls under royale catagory so you need to pay extra charges for haircut as well to get this service.
Uc service is not to the standard they claim. Everytime you book service always late and had to do multiple follow up. Hair cut is worst you book then professional don't turn up. Customer had to call and raise request. Then they reassign after 2 hours. Your plan n day completely screwed up. Now they don't have option to revert the membership fee. If they start paying the fine or discount for all mess up to customer then process will improve
Excellent service from Urban Company.
Very Nice App.....Thank you
I can't find facial/face clean up services in the app now.Is it discontinued?
Except hair salon, UC is good for nothing. We booked a cleaner several days in advnace, the guy neither turned up nor informed us. And worse is I had to inform the UC call centre about this!! And UC could not arrange another person to support. So never trust their services, better go locally.
I was trying so badly for a booking, but the booking is not getting confirmed and it's really urgent. I am really not satisfied. If please it could help and say if servicing near my area is available or no
I am totally disappointed because professional has not completed the work Totally bad
Claim warranty does not work. Iam unable to call the customer care either.
Excellent
Easy app to use! User friendly interface. Keep up the good work!
You guys outsource the work to subcontractors when i paid premium rate for your folks to come n do the work. Why do you do it without my consent ?? I paid a premium for you folks to a quality job set by standards n professionalism. This is unethical & illegal.
excellent
Why there are no options displaying for Cleanup and Facial ?? Any issue with app ?
Chor hay ..faltu add and reting dekhke biswas mat karo..chit froud company
Its was really pathetic my experience was not good I booked urban company on bases of reviews but very much disappointed.....cleaner has not done deep cleaning moping not done properly.....paid for utensils but all utensils were missing except dusting cloth and glass cleaner...vacuum cleaner was not working...mop was not there....horrible experience I m working woman planning to book 4 times in month but after that I have not booked any cleaner....
Very bad experience.. I had booked a beautician and waited for hours but she did not arrive. How is your app #1.. it's rubbish. And how 80% customer rated this app 5star. The rating box is full of complaints. Urban clap has only apologises nothing else to solve customer issues. Worst app..I have wasted my time.. and I need compensation for it..don't download this app it's of no use.. #ghatiya #faltu
Forcing to store the credit card number
Worst experience Urban clap...I booked a service for 25th but the beautician denied to come and had fixed another date without my permission and knowledge. I have also paid for my service which Urban clap has not yet returned and it's been 11 days now. Very poor service you just don't value your customers. Return my money.
I like it
Very bad experience. I have gave my tv for repair and now it's been 1week ter is no update and always I need to follow up. Whenever I call they say tomorrow we will get.very bad experience
It was my first time my experience was amazing
A very comprehensive packaged App...excellent end to end service
Bad experience
please give more importance to UC employee they are working great
Really poor service wasted my 3 days as the the booking was in progress and when the booking was done the technician cancelled the booking as it was unservisable now dicided by tecnicial .I have taken the service on the same address earlier . Now unstalling the app as customer service also doing the same wasting my time even though priority customer.
Horrible team, unprofessional professionals. Stay away, all fake promises, no appointments and super buggy app
job done professionally...good job
You pick this app, be ready for very soft spoken, trained call center agents apologizing with you on every single booking. Never on time and barely finish work these days with their sub contracted agencies.
Good service by Urban Company.
I have been having horrible experiences on my bookings with Urban Company. Unreliable, rude and extremely bad professionals are being assigned. I don't recommend their services to anyone. For one microwave repair the same person was sent thrice... They said they will send a senior executive but the same man appeared. For cleaning services twice the booking was cancelled and one last time after call from customer care manager they still could not find anyone to provide the service and cancelled.
I clean kitchen chimney by UC.its excellent work in less time.
They ruined my sofa fabric and even after agreeing for refund of 10k I have not received any money.
The service professional damaged our tv. Post that he is asking for service charges. Once I raised the complaint, he is harrasing me by calling multiple times. Extremely poor people employed by Urban Clap
Bad House Cleaning Services , No proper work , Very Bad Experience
It is a real hassle to select previous service providers for an upcoming need. Their slots are shown as full for 3-4 days but upon checking the next day all slots are available. Kindly do not mislead customers like this.
Covering all aspects of household maintenance, the company is doing a great job by providing trained personnel at reasonable charges. It is safer to have professionals provided by a Company rather than call unknown personnel to do maintenance work.
very good app..for beauty services. I am updating my rating and it still remains the best with array of household services they have added. I would suggest them to add gardening services to their portfolio and target tier 2 and tier 3 cities as well. To start I would upfront suggest Raipur Bhilai...where most are working nuclear families and need support .
All the facial services are gone edit your package makes no sense
I'm really happy with urban company services because of their polite staffs and their services are provided with all safety perecations. I just loved their servicesüëçüèª
Poor coordinator
trustworthy
Consider the customers pricing based on time also because professionals are not serving as per the time mentioned.
very nice service provider..
I am in total love with this wonderful application to all my problems one answer UC. I think if you add on call domestic help service for routine household chores it will be icing on the cake.
You people can lie even on email. Such unprofessional. Its better to put a legal complain now .
Not good service anymore The staff try to fool around Show dissatisfaction with Urban company and request for direct personal contact instead of via urban company The quality of service degraded. Local servicemen are doing better than UC staff
Frode company hai...uc chor hai
Thank you...
When I'm sick I'd like to get my dishes done. Why is there no service like that?
All are Basturds ,they will take the money and will not send any professionals......
I am not able to download the app
Update 4: I have learnt that you should never book aquagaurd services from UC. I use Forbes app instead. UC I use only for electricians, cleaning services 3R Update 3-- This time issue was with aquagaurd professionals hired by UC don't know anything about aquagaurd they are all fake don't use this app for aquagaurd UPDATE2---- Although below issue still exist in the app, Thanks UC for calling me back and get required help. Also Please provide a straight forward way to reach out to your helpsesk.
It's impressive üëçüëç #UrbanCompany #SalonAtHome #collab
perfect service very useful app
I don't recommend this company, it's too expensive for the level of professional work. No matter how many times you complain, the level of work is not satisfactory
Good
great idea for UC ..awesome
I raised complaint twice regarding AC service, the issue is showing as resolved, whereas it was not. I will not recommend anyone for Urban Clap. #Bad_Experience.
Cashback options are fake
No show from the professionals for car wash twice in a row. Wasted my time waiting for them. Despite not turning up for the jobs, no reschedule for car wash. I cancelled all my scheduled bookings. No respect for my time.
excellent job done
Highly disappointed with their system. They try to find create issue and then put cancellation charges. Customer care people talk with ego and do lot of unwanted argument. Their professional specially Batheoom cleaning after arriving make excuses that this and that will not be done. Poor service
Very bad response when u call No answer number of times called
Pathetic service......
Where is Sara fruit cleanup which you had earlier ?? There is customer care service number to even ask about it. Very disappointing!!!!
Excellent service.
Technicians are frauds - During the AC installation process, the technician asked for gas refilling and when i refused, he made an excuse to send me to get a wire extension and removed the gas completely at my back. Then again pitched in for gas refilling at 1250 (50% less than urban's standard 2499 charge)
Not setisfide with service
awesome app...awesome professional work...happy for this
Excellent cleaning service
Yeh kisi ke nahi hai inhe pese se matlab hai
very nice and professional services
My experience as an new customer is totaly disgusting, as i had booked 2 services on two different dates and both were not delivered to me, they provide us date and time slots to select as per our comfort,but they fails to deliver and even their customer support team gives fake commitment , i am a private employee, i had a half day pay today only because i relied on them and waited for their service to deliver, I strongly recommend not to use their service as a customer
I want Manoj Kumar for bathroom cleaning you assign someone else
Worst experience of instaling this app in my mobile, i strongly suggest not to use their service, as one of my friend got fake commitment regarding delivering their service on actual date and time, not at all reliable, he faced alot of problem because he relied on them.
Application isn't working... Please Check ‚úÖ it.... Trying to Open since a week from now...
It is a fraud company! I had been using the services since many years. The services I take every 20 days is bathroom cleaning, and it was okay till date but the last service. The service partner broke my fittings, I shared the pictures and raised a complaint on call and mail both. The company says they are not responsible for my damages due to their policies and I can stop using the services if I am unsatisfied. Also they are not ready to share the terms and conditions and policies on mail.
27 Jan 22 Horrible service again. My regular helper got changed at last min on 26 Jan 22. The service was for today 27 Jan 22. When call the help line. The customer service officer Roy didn't even bother to return call. This is the 2nd time they are making things difficult.
good services
she is very experienced. fast and hood service . maintain hygiene. so I'm happy ü§©üòçüòá
Very nice service üëå
Thanks for helping us out in tough times.
Always as usual a perfect satisfaction ü§©üòçüòç
The consultancy of Rajesh Sharma was too good üòä. And the way he had talked with us it was so good üôå
I registered an issue as I wasn't able to see one of the service I already used on their prime section. When I requested a CB from UC they said the professionals aren't available and would resume that particular service soon. So I reached out to the professionals (all the ones who provided me the service on the past) and they sai they are available and UC is just trying to push their customers to use their prime service. That's kinda scam and looting people.
No customer service contact number. The professionals are good with their work, but UC needs proper customer service reach. Pay a tip for one service and they continue to add a tip for all services booked after that with no option to cancel tip in payment section.
perfect cleaning
Unprofessional cleaners
They do an awesome job
Professional clean and Prompt Service
Not recommended as changes are very very high compared to local prices . I have to spend 200 rs for service person 2 minutes visit and hear that part replacement is only option with rs 4500( which seems double amount when inquired in market)
I totally recommend urban company to others as i got very gud service from them. They do their work very nicely done. There is no tensen to clean after sevrice they clean all the area by thrm it self. Loved the urban company servies.
Technician damage my washing machine and company failed to provide any resolution ...worst experience...Used local motor and charge of the original motor price....stop working after 2 days
good
Work provided is not satisfactory. Its been more than one month and they have assigned like zillions of technician and instead fixing it they messed up the gyeser and now neither urban company is helpful and nor their technician. Urban Company doesn't have the proper coordination with the technician and because during revisit technician wasn't ready to do the service under UC claim benefits as they mentioned Company doesn't refund the amount.
I m appreciate this app Good staff and facilities I strongly recommend this to everyone I have a wonderful experience with it
great first service
Really very disappointed with the app..trying to book the carpenter for 2 days ...once we give pay option it's started loading and closes the screen automatically
Very good experience üòáüòáüòá
Need more improvement in App. Booking is not much informative.
Excellent services
Nice
Professional left the service and never came back. I raised a complaint, there was no call back from Urban clap and was asked to pay an extra 99 bucks for no reason. No one will help you, you have to keep wasting your precious time in follow ups. Its better to do service from local guys in your neighborhood. Ratings are all paid. Edit : the urban clap escalation team called me up and said," you can do your service somewhere else/ from outside" . Thank you !!
sameer
Service is good but service charges are high. I called for microwave problem .one of the part had to be changed,he referred for the costliest one,whereas there were other 2 options which were cheaper.This I wouldn't have known as a layman ,but when I compared in Amazon,I came to know the rates.customers should not be cheated like this
My AC damaged during service in the month of 8/2021and I regularly complaining but nothing has done as yet
Best app to use
Worst app
I really appreciate urban company home salon services. All beauty equipment are good and clean. I like ur work ü•∞ü•∞
Badd salon services r proper bad specialy beautician nirmala very bad woman very loud voice like Sadakichap beautician don't be Beyer her üëé
Worst experience with UC, I painted my walls by UC professionals. But within 2 weeks it had aircracks, when I raised complaint they are giving fake promises for repairing it(earlier assigned to original painter, when he didn't turn up later assigned to another painter but he also doesn't seem to be interested in repairing it) and not really supporting in repair. It's been more than 4 weeks I am following up with them but there's no progress in my complaint. Really disappointed.
Urban clap is the best service provider for Housekeeping.
I have used urban company once , I was very happy with their services provided that to at our convenience. They also made sure all the safety measures were followed. I would suggest everyone to try urban company.
Th e service is good.all things are done professionally and they very clean all products are sanitized and super clean.a ll staff wear mask use gloves...
UC don'thave Men's Pedicure Home service.
love working with App or Team...very good experience love sharing my experience about urban company work with you all.thank you
Superb sarvice
It's very good. customer service very nice just go for it
Excellent service
A professional and no nonsense organization.
I booked a service and before 1 hour they saying the professional does not have the kit to provide service , I needed the service so I said send any other at 6:30. Its 10:15 pm ...I cant even go to parlour now .. n they instead of providing service refunded my money and I cant evn talk to customer care .. pathetic service and even pathetic customer care
Worst experience.service cancelled by app and got msg of charges for cancellation. Thank god i didn't paid in advance.Everyone do not pay in advace
Zero * Please be careful when booking home cleaning from UC , professionals cheat you buy taking money for 4 bhk and then they clean only 3 bhk ...I am very shocked and upset with their work...and on top left out photo frame broken and didn't bother to inform us
I really appreciate urban company. I like their salon services. Salon representative is very professional and punctual.
Excellent

Urban company painting service is really very good all supportive team are excellent.... Resolve my all problem quickly thanks a lot
Tried for first time for my tv repair though the repair cost was bit high than the local repair shop but got the result in just 3 hrs. Happy to use üòÅ
Hi People, please stop using their service, look like they have lost it, neither are they aiming at providing service but also looting customers. They don't even have a number that PPL can call, neither do they respond to feeds. I highly recommend that until they do something please don't every choose to pay in advance for any service. They are looting customers. I never expected urban clap to cheat people.
payment option sucks.
Those idiots who charge cost + extra + extra + extra like the base cost + convenience fee + minimum order fee + bla bla + bla bla in the name of company policy are just another bunch of stupid, greedy jurk offs... The only thing they can do is loot. Don't ask me to elaborate... Look at onstantly falling datewise review s...
I really appreciate urban company all types of helping staff and sanitizer and clean. All staff is wearing mask üò∑ and wear gloves üß§.
Trust me Don't get any work done from them, They came and replaced twice a part for geyser and it still doesn't work properly
parts price are very high
Fantastic
Good job
Fantastic service and really worth the money,i will definitely be regular customer with urban ,thank you and special thanks to ramesh for his patience and completing job ,will repeat him for the next session.
Professional work and no headache of cleaning post work they took care of it. It's worth trying. Satisfied with the services.
awesome üëç
It's really very nice... I think one must try once with this urban company app
excellent service by Shanthi...
I really appreciate urban company home salon services.all equipments are very good and customer service is good. I really happy...
Too expensive
Good
Bahut bura service hai several time main professional ko call kar raha hu o phn utha nahi rage hain or urban company sa vi koi help nahi mila.... Ap logo k upar bharosai uth gaye hain a dekh kar.. I am to much disappointed..
Worst customer service. Cannot understand their own terms and condition and further more , insinuating that I'm lying when the so called expert refused to do complete the job and had asked me to procure the parts and do it myself. SHAME on URBAN CLAP
Worst experience ever. They make you pick a schedule but then don't follow it themselves. Moreover, the disinfectant service was done by just spraying plain water all over the place without mixing adequate (any) ratio of chemical in it. UNINSTALLED
Waste
Our first experience with UC was excellent and we will recommend this to others also
The application was really awesome and a wonderful experience the service of hair salon was amazing i really appreciate it üòä
I am very happy with there service üòÄ
Service person Cheating on advanced booking service without coming to flat.
We tried many times for booking slots and tried video conference with experts still not received any call back. The UC app is time wasting
Explain the issue over video call
Very awful experience. Beautician, who ce to my home know nothing, I have burn marks on hand and leg and rashes on face, and urban company was no where ready to take responsibility of their inexperienced partner.üëé
For God sake give me options to select a professional or consider the point of changing the professional. I can see there's my last professional but if I'm not opting her don't choose her for me again nd again. Worst application services
It was a great experience!
Service was Good
Unable to book the service.
Very useful
super service highly recommended.. nice behaviour by Prakash
I really appreciate Urban company home salon service .all beauty equipment or santinized and clean staff is wearing mask and used üß§
very nice
Just like another unaccountable money minded company, ethics is useless for them and costomer care girl is more keen than you to cancle the booking if you raise a point. I have booked matteress cleaning & after their representative came they are asking for double charges. They have not mentioned single/double bed option in app to make a GREY area for last time earning My bad decision i have taken UC Plus membership also
Good
No facial service is defined Please clear it.
Nice services
over price for all small works
Tried pedicure and iam satisfied with the service

Bad experience with this, the customer service is the worst .. if you open one case they will keep it in open status and can't reach them after that. You ll get the message that will get a call back in 15 mins but you'll never get that and you are stuck
Why facial option is not showing in list ... What is this behaviour?
Excellent app.. More convinent to use nd helpful
Good
It's very helpful and good app i just loved it and it's amazing to be it's app users
Good
Home Service is very good,person are maintained distance and are fully higeined n sanitized...they are very punctual and cooperative..
Urban company in very good product in India.
I love this app. It is very useful during this pandemic situation.. And the people who came for sevice is well sanitize and vaccinated staffs..
Good..
Urban company bed
There have higher rates for members....n lower rates for non members on the same package....for not pay extra to become one
The service is still good, but the app is worse. After booking a service, it lands to a lot of unwanted things but doesn't clearly mention the services booked. It talks about offering a tip towards professional before even the professional is assignd. Most pathetic part is the newest version gave up the option to rebook the same professional from past bookings. What the hell - when the customer's paying why don't u give them the option to choose who'll do the service. Urban Clap was far better.
good
Very useful app. All services provided are amazing and it is a very user friendly app. The most easy to use and very helpful at times of covid ‚ú®
Such a nice app
Services are professional and good
It was really great to use this app!!Their services was obviously clean and neat.Its very easy to use and I highly recommend this app.They have more and more availabilities in their app.If you are looking for a good app for safety and protective service go ahead for this.
Excellent
One company chor hai sirf partner Ko luti
pedicure service not available at my location.... this is a joke
I really appreciate urban company home salon services.
Nice. good
good service
I am very happy using this app and satisfied with your service, also I recommend my friends to use this app.
I have used the app and m in love with their service.
Such unprofessional people. Urban company person was serving my neighbour's AC and splashed all dirty water at our home. Was also using abusive language at us when we asked about it.
Very clen an senytizid and helpfull app
the service is very poor. my split ac is open by technician and not given proper service so I complaint to customer care but they are not giving any support. The Ac is completely open and all parts are lying at my place.
Cleaning was very bad
Very good service.. I really like it..
This time it was nice experience
Very good home saloon I recommend to my friends .
Clean shave service given as option but mandatory to select add on package massage rs. 99 without that you can not checkout . Pathetic experience
excellent
Very good and perfect products i love this app
Very polite and patience he is having to work done
Theses service r gud but it is not available in paradeep
Amazing super
urban company home salon service very unique ...I like and very appreciate...all Beauty enquipment r very clean and sanitized ..staff r very nice and wearing mask and gloves..
A perfect company who supports us in tough time with all the precautions and more important their staff maintain hygine.
I really like urban company home salon company,all beauty equipment are sensitized and clean, staff is wearing gloves and mask it's all good
No customer care, no refund on order cancelation, keep figuring out for months if you make a mistake...
i like urban company services. they use hygenic beuty material. and equipments also clean and sanitize. they wear mask. which very needy now days.
When you take a booking you ask for loaction, you ask for service, you ask for time and date of booking of our choice then you don't turn up because the call was not picked. My job is to be over call and attend meetings. This is work from home. But professional didn't turn up because he couldn't confirm over call. Why do you waste my time with location and service confirmation through app? Why don't you just have phone service where I can and book that ways you are happy with call service.
Nice service
Very good service , I am very happy with their work . KEEP IT UP!
Good site
Do you have painters ?
Very beautiful app.I appreciate to use this app
Not satisfactory. The professional cancelled the booking right at the reporting time. Please avoid hiring such unprofessional work force.
Customer help it's not working...
I had used your services for my geyser your representative had changed the heating element as he described to me after service but yesterday I saw a problem in my geyser again so I directly call him he today again checked it and tell me that your geyser's heating element is again get damaged so need to change it please tell me last time I had changed it by Company representative directly it works for many years but this time it works for only 2 months not even single season of winter
uc company is good service
Really good
Unprofessional service with no proper communication, requested for call back multiple times for improper service and no response at all.
I really like this app I suggest to to you please download this app and use this app foe booking yours ride and always enjoy with this app ride ok thank you
Fuss free booking! Pros They focus alot on hygiene. Impressed that they replaced the "sandpaper" after each foot filing. Nail Files and Buffer are all new and will give to customer after each session. Paper Towels are once off. No need to top up for quick dry or extra charges for soak off. No hard selling and all they asked for are a good review if they did a good job. Cons Not very environmental friendly BUT we can always opt to re-use the tools given to us or to use our own.
Very very worst service. I booked for salon for men 3 days prior. But professional is not assigned till last minute. They asked me to reschedule. I rescheduled for next day. Again same thing happened. Likewise same thing for 3 days. Atlast i frustrated and canel my booking. No proper response from UC till now. Pls don't believe UC anymore.
Very bad. Misguided by technician. Mis behaved. Customer service (Help Centre) option in app is not good. First we have to message then he call back in what time don't know.I have messaged the custmer service but they didnot call me and resolve my problem. Technician name is Inderpal Nanglia(New Delhi).
I do not recommend the services of hair grooming with urban company. My experience: Booked hair cut at 7am and till 9 am there is no show by the dresser and no update from UC team. There is no way wherein a customer can call / contact the UC team. This is the situation when you have UC paid membership. Please restrict yourself to buy annual plan or any sort of subscription offered by UC. Useless and hopeless services. There is no option of giving rating less than 1.
Highly disappointed. What is the logic of removing the facial and cleanup services if the beautician is working at close proximity for all other services. Have paid the membership fee for the whole year and cannot even avail all services!
It's great choice at saloon at home with toddler at convenience time
Service of urban company is excellent ,and professional they hire are very good at work and they do their job with dedication.
Lovely
Ghatiya company hai Sab se paisa loot raha hai
I like that app
I booked a geyser installation service through them and the mechanic assured me that it was completely safe to use when I asked him to check the line. When I went to take a shower I felt an electric current when I touched the tap and it continued even after I turned the geyser off. So ya I could have died because of their negligence. After all of this they refused to give my money back and kept insisting on sending the same mechanic. I am thoroughly disappointed. I am not using this app again.
Its a verygood company. I am fully satisfied.. And very happy... I suggests my friends
Used To Love it But My Recent Experience with them was extremely dissatisfying
They take things seriously.....special thanks to Subhangee for taking my case n getting it solved....she is a good human being....thank you Urban company
Their so called professional are so unprofessional. They didn't completed my work and took money and when I raised an issue he stopped answering my calls and their help centre is also so useless when I said my problem to them they just assigned my with the same professional and again he did the same thing. And now their help centre is also not answering my call. Please think twice before using this useless app.
Nice and excellent app
Wonderful professional service at reasonable rates.
Last 4 to 5 days I m trying to book home salon service but now the packege is really not worthy. There is no fecial option in services.and the rates is also high I m moving to other option. It's really pathetic app.
I already appreciate urban company home salon service. Everything is clean and sanitized staff is wearing mask and good behaviour üòä
You guys deserve this for professionals you have and the services
Urban company is best for me last 2yrs but now why facial service is not available? It's not showing any facial package.I didn't understand. Anyone kindly reply me.
Nice
Bit costly
There is no contact number mentioned in the app. Whenever I try to book an ac service it keeps on giving message saying no slots available. Why can't we have a call to schedule a booking? I've subscribed a plan which will expire in next 10 days. What should I do now?
Best app ever all services are excellent..
Last service worst
Yes üëç üëç this is very helpful for ladies...I just like to...and I satisfied with urban salon...I always used urban company and I most liked it...it's safe and soft for ladies.
Am really happy with service of urban company and very good product. And price is also resneable.thanku urban company
If you cancel the service before given cut off time, still about 20% amount is deducted.
Unable to connect with UC if there is an issue not getting booking
rates are high
Earlier it was fabulous app...easy to use but now the urban company has made the app difficult to use. I can't choose all the services in MAKE MY OWN PACKAGE... No choice of facial ... prices increased.... I'm not finding it good in any way.. Plz get the older service menu back...
Urban company a fab service..i would strongly recommend.
Good followup, punctuality
They professionals who visit by urban clab are highly unprofessional with timings. And urban calb has no clue how to resolve it ..they have just made unexperiences executives sit in call center who hardly know how to resolve the problem.
Most services not having prices, price is very high when plumber booked for estimate and service
This company is not a well educated service person only promote the build up the customer
good
Very good experience amazing üëè
It's just amzaing service. Staff service & behaviour is good awesome service and rates are convenient.
very good and professional company.
Excellent
Horrible work done , in the name of deep cleaning what was done at my place had to be cleaned again , and the local help was much cheaper and worth also without any fancy gadgets and fancy detergents my local help was much better with regards to the work assigned. I highly do not recommend anyone to go ahead with urban company specially in kolkata
Very poor service.Professional are either busy or they cancel their appointment on thier own.
Prompt service.
Professional and well behaved.
service is Good .only one problem no customer care..
Nice and go for it
Does this app look good visually
idk much right now, I am new here and that was my first service experience which was good btw but I need more of your services for now and after that I will update this review for sure ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I would say it's best !!üëåhome service for salon üíÖ
Its really appreciable service..i must recommend it my friends
Amazing working professionals. just came across that Urban Company collaborated with skill India to train professionals and give them job opportunity. This is one of the best initiative I came across. More and more innovative ways of solving modernized issues require a company like Urban Company. All the best to the whole team and Keep growing.
Superb app easy to use and it is very helpfull for the now situation when people can't go outside
Nice apps very helpfull this lokdown season time very help people üëçüòä
Horrible service...every time i book..your call centre..calls back to cancel the booking.. this is the 4th time in a row.. and i have to deal with your customer service who have no ettiquetes ..they hang up the call saying they are going to call back with a solution and then never call back.. cust rep name .. Anagha Jain.. pls take some action against the rep and above all your services are unreliable and unprofessional.. a membership paying member since 3 yrs but now uninstalling the app.
Awesome professional services
Worst company. Better go with local mechnics. Atleast u will have a relationship with them. These people send any random guy to repair. These people screwd up my washing machine! Left me no other option other than buying new one. Be careful with these people! They definitely dont have good after service too!
It helps prople in every aspects. I must say everyone must install it.
The jobs listed are really worth and the professionals are very good at what they do. The app is simply the best with easy navigation and with all the required details available at finger tips.
Opted for Intense bathroom cleaning .....was extremely satisfied with the personnel and the overall hygiene
very good Person
Fabulous user experience and well trained partners.
best
good
Good
One of the best app that provides had working professionals who steals our heart with their hardwork and dedication.
Disinfectant service not worth . Not recommending..
Customer Support is poor, you cannot trust on executive
Nobody call me. However they mentioned job completed. Fake app
Urban company very bad App
Very good üòä
Best service professionals for every need of work
Haha...now you want my details to resolve the issue...sorry but i have switched myself to other providers..just waiting to post this on fb and other platforms as well so u can lose more....
I had booked for my air conditioner uninstall and install in another location. Total ‚Çπ1697/-. After uninstall, technician had a look the new location for install they have quote me ‚Çπ7000+‚Çπ1697. I was shocked and I cannot cancel the installation service, i cancelled the whole service and paid ‚Çπ850 to the technician. But ‚Çπ650 only for uninstall. ‚Çπ150 for COVID SPECIAL CHARGES. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE FOOL THE PEOPLE. THANK GOD I DIDN'T DONE ONLINE PAYMENT. This was the first and last.
good service
The quality of service has reduced a lot compared to when this started. It's almost like getting cheap service for higher pay.
service was good . only problem was they dont clean the down surface area( as i saw videos there they were doing. ) all stains dont go. just to clean up the service is good.
Very good
Worst experience they are overpriced for there services. A big no to there services.
It's online booking and swift responses and on time job.
Good concept and service but bad UI...the app can definitely be better and more intuitive...add cart option should be there to be able to select multiple services or packages.
Pathetic service . Please don't get your RO serviced through Urban Company. All time, their Technician tries to make fool to the customer. Worst Part is when you claim warranty, There Technician take money of the part replaced under warranty while App shows there is no money to be paid.
Nice ‚ù§Ô∏è
There is no customer care number on which we can contact
so
2 times have booked for haircut for kids, your so called professional rejected after making us wait for 3 hours, uninstalled the app n never gonna use it. Worst service ever.
No thanks and your professionals are always wanted to do service without app book I don't want to disclose their names Many times I booked for a service but always same problem All the professional are not hiegenic they are not wearing URBAN COMPANY uniforms They don't even clean thier tools and bags And in this pandemic they don't wear gloves ,masks as well These problems are very small but they down your Market value So make sure that all these problems should be resolved .
very good and promt service.
I am very happy with urban company
very good
excellent
My washing machine problem was resolved on video call.U C expert was polite with good knowledge.Excellent service!üëç
Using urban clap from last 3 years but while using the service of home deep cleaning then I realised how urban company cheat with his clients. It's customer support was pathetic. Anurag and Pankaj the support executive are liar and I suggest all of new users to not use it's home cleaning service. Their professional are untrained, they don't have professional ethics. They left the premises by doing incomplete services. I don't see the images uplaod option here else I will show you what they did
good service provided........having much patience & polite......feel free to contact her, she will give best results
This is the second time professionals didn't arrived at my place and asking me to reschedule which is really very disappointing. Nowadays, company is least bothered of customer satisfaction and more focused to pour the customers money for big advertisements.
I had a worst experience. When I booked for a service this people splitted the work in to two and looting our money like anything. Not even deserved for a single star. Even having a worst customer support. He(Dilip) is not at all Listening to me, then how can he resolve my issue.
Really appreciate this app. All Beauty products are executive and amazing. Love it.
Worst experience. The professional does not come on time and they charge you for cancellations.
Good
The new appliance protection plan is simply a money extortion process launched by UC. They cover minimum 3 appliances the cost of which works out to be minimum 2K. Then the person calls up and raises dispute on 1 or 2 products and asks us to pay more for booking another paid service for those products without which it cannot be covered. Cites issues like minor paint issue in a one year old product. Better not to fall in the trap of such money making missions by UC.
Very nice app I loved the app
Hopeless service. One of my AO Smith Geyser was serviced 3-4 months back. Now the customer care executive told me no one in Bangalore services AO Smith. How rediculous is this..
Good
No professional was assigned to me for schedule timing of 9.30 am. Got a call that no one is available at 9.25 am. How disappointing. UC claims to be so professional but my experience is different
Wrost app try to book a service for tv installation since last 5 days every time massage comes all our professionals are busy in your area will notify till now all others promotional massages came except required massege...If possible will give 0 Star...Don't install...
These guys are frauds, do not use their service. I called them to clean my bathroom and the cleaner used acids and destroyed all the bathroom with his acid. My bathroom floor, taps, seat everything they destroyed. After that I spoke to urbanclap and they promised me to give a reimbursement for my bathroom provided giving them the bill. I gave the bill for the taps and they said their company doesn't allow these reimbursements. Guys BEWARE these guys are just to fool common people.
excellent
Great service üëè
Not happy with the service. Washrooms are still with hard water stain. It looked clean when they left after cleaning since the floor & wall were wet. But the next day we can see the dirt .... The hard water stain not cleaned at all. Waste of money and time. If u could send someone with proper machine & right liquid solution would be great.
I've only ever tried the services for fixing my refrigerator and it was spectacular and I've never faced further issues or any problem so a big thank you from my end.
Good
the app is very nice and help full üôÇüòÄ
long waiting for video consultant but overall nice experience
I really appreciate urban company home salon services, staff wearing mask and used gloves, All beauty equipment are sanitized and clean, good job, excellent.
The toilets were cleaned well by the male professional. He was accompanied by two women who were his relatives and there was also their two year old daughter. The women were short. Their stature did not permit them to reach the top of the cupboards or even the fans to do a cleaner job. The women were also constantly disturbed by the child. The kitchen was not scrubbed clean by the women. They took longer in the kitchen. They also closed the kitchen door for whatever reason. No cleaner job.
Good
No experience
At home service, making our lives easy
Good
Prices are almost triple of what is the market rate. And quality of service is also just average. The photos and video demonstrations in the app are so misleading..
Good
I really like it Overallüëçüèª
Professional specially shaheen from luxe gives her mobile number to call directly n uses Urbandale products n charges urban clap rates saying we can do dat.asks to give 5 star rating n not to book wit u.c. Even after bringing to notice of customer care they take no action.
Excellent very professional
very good professional mr tanmay vyas extnal services
Not at all professional
satisfied
I really appreciate the efforts. Products are awesome
nice work
This company has told me a lot of mind, hey, this company will never give this company to him.
Yes I m totally setisfy from his work of carpenter . Value for money ... Totally resemble rate .....I surely recommended to others.. ...tx urben ...
good service
excellent service
Bahot heng hota hai
I have tried many times to book services but always I am getting reply as all our service personnel are busy we will notify you when available. But till now I have not received any notification. There is no provision in app to place a phone call. An app built with haste without proper planning
Been a very useful for daily needs
Quick customer service, my issues were resolved within 10 minutes
Very poor they hier theif and send theif to homes Urban clap Peron stole my parcel from Dombivali Very unprofessional Very very bad dnt call them
New update in the app for salon is bad. I understand facial, cleanup and upper lip is removed due to covid but what is face waxing? half the options are lost like side locks waxing, etc. Also signature pedicure is written signature manicure in pedicure section. There is no customer care section to communicate issues via text or call.
really worth it. very professional services.
Pathatic service....with in a week they cancelled two booking. So unprofessional.
No facial service listed... Since yesterday I am searching for facial service but unable to find it in any category
Nice services
professional work good job.I will suggest house owners to call for bathroom cleaning at least once in 6 months
I booked for my kitchen deep cleaning ,urban company professional (Mr. Anil sherpha) done his job neat and clean and he is a well behaved person too..
Worst service.plmber did some repair to flush tank for water leakage.still same problem and lost 3000 ltd of water through leak.reschduled plumber did not come for the last 3days,but the company people called me more than half a dozen times. Worst service and I request all not to encourage this company.
good
Urban Clap is really good and efficient and made life easier and smooth.
Very good app n can easily get any service as soon as possible, i really appreciate urban company home saloon services..
Ju ke nnjis nanjojz kinin n kk jnk kk nn ki jo in kzzssssazo ok ka j jin k ie ijo
It's really awesome to purchase
Nice app awesome service
Really a very good and trusted company...as they take precautions and we'll prepared...and are just on time...
Very bad services .... actually worst.... charges are not at all reasonable .... plumber using plumbing tap and replying I have not charged any repair items used charges .....as if doing some kind of meherbani on the customer....apply some reasonable charges to the customer for miniscule work done....
Urban Company services are getting deteriorated day by day. I booked for bathroom cleaning yesterday at 6:30 pm. but the professional denied after waiting till 8:00 pm and after contacting customer service, they assured for today at 8:00 am but the same thing repeated again and professional didn't came till 1:00 pm and after that he denied to come......Worst experience ever with any service ageny
great
Want to give zero stars for the pathetic services
used urban company first time and delighted with the services provided. Exceeded expectations
I liked urbanclap and used their salon at home services regularly, however, all of a sudden they have removed a lot of the services like facials, detans etc in Pune, so now basically you can just book them for waxing or hair related services. Why urbanclap ... Why??
there is no customer care details available....not sure whom to contact in case of issue. Only email id available which no use
Didn't acknowledge the bond back guarantee after the operator failed to do the job correctly twice. Then failed to respond and dodged emails.
Good service
It provides good service with safety measures and the staff is well organized and professionals.
Very worrest not responsible persons proper confirmation not there high cost
skilled technicians ..great job üëç
Excellent service
highly professional and I'm satisfied with the service
perfect. service
I am ac technician. I installed urban app But in my locationüìç no more urban service Thank you
You have a horrible service. Past 3 months I haven't been able to make any booking. Today 22.01.2022 tha app took the subscription fee of 299 and then again showing error while booking services. YOU ARE FRAUD, REFUND MY MONEY
During online review does not diagnose problem properly
Beware of money eaters and cheaters ....Very expensive they overcharge for everything just for one small switch replacement they charge 90 Rs i replaced 9 switches they are costing 1000 Rs . there professionals wantedly make invoice put extra bills and make us pay more ...even we can repair our own just 2 mins work .. 90 Rs is too much Very expensive for one tiny switch ...useless money eaters not recommended...it's better to call local technicians and make it done for low price
This app is safe n trust worthy.... We can get any services at reasonable. N affordable price.. Go for it..
It gives great service, I have tried it and everyone else is professional and works well and does not take much money.And everyone talks well and doesn't take any extra charge, he just takes whatever happens.I have definitely told everyone to take its service once recommended üëçüëç
As always! Nothing's changed
üòä
well mannered staff
The experience in Kalinganagar, Bhubaneswar was not at all gud.. although booking was done for full house cleaning however the washroom was not at all cleaned. Also after service payment was not so smooth
Really amazing, quality services n polite explanation.
Affordable safer time-saver hassle free service provider
Worst company, In painting services they will take full amount, after that you will walk around, no customer care support, and said you didn't check urban clap policy
Video support was excellent to find the issue....
Poor
Not able to reach out to anyone
Worst experience with this company and its service..useless
Awesome experience üëè ... executive is very polite as well as well trained...
Best working app
Earlier urban clap was very bad. They changed name to urban company, initially it was good. Now the quality of service persons has deteriorated. No skill. To make matters worse, the service guys are trying to get money by saying nonexistent problems. Bye bye to Urban Company
Nice
fully satisfied with Mr Praveen work
ok
Not very happy with the app. It's very confusing to navigate through. Moreover, the specific services that I need for home cleaning, are not there.
satisfactory
Worthy
Deep cleaning Bathroom service ~ very average service
Undoubtedly their work is excellent. Completed the work on time. Full care was taken under the covid rules. My family members were surprised to see the cleanliness. Everyone is very happy. thanks urban club
Urban company is cheat or their employee i dont know but i have been cheated today by ratan patra he came and said i have to change dc valve of my washing machine so i did 1571 was charged and the problem is still there he forced me to do the rating first before completing his job and after completing his job he just left within 5min, i called him back now he is saying i have to add filter now 2200 rs for that .. I want a refund
Worst
Good service
very good experience. Men's salon available but female's not available in my area of khagaul road.
While my past experiences have been good, today, neither did the service provider call nor show up. UC has made no attempt to reach me either
This rating for covinient affordable and safe services.
Don't trust ..Cancelling the revisit by y urbanclap itself and asking why I cancelled .I thought your technician is fraud . But total company is fraud cheating people . Don't trust this App . I will never let this problem you will face the consequences.
very good home services.
The worst services
Good app
Not good
stupid App it do booking by it self and take money then ask for money for cancellation and the service center didn't answer.
Very thorough professional, reliable and fully compliant of pandemic safety precautions promulgated by Govt. Partner outlets are competent and technicians curteous and budiness like. Very credible service provider. Once I call UC, assurance of good service is guaranteed. Always rely on them especially during these pandemic times.
very good
again updating my reviews it was really great experience with urban company definitely the person who is coming to your place is represented I definitely recommend that you should do your booking with app only not directory great experience will give again 5 Star Plus rating
Office phone number for SMS should be available in App
What a poor service.... Professional never ans the call... Nor they intimate you about the delay... 2-3 hours of delay... Not done... Failed service app
Am an Urban company partner I have an issue with PPE kit. From nearly 4months am not getting my PPE kit and am purchasing it from outside. There is no one who can solve my problem as they are ignoring my issue when complained. Am unable to work without this kit. Hope atleast it will be resolved after this.
just making fool to the customer cs team said that you can make a payment through wallet however while making a payment there was no wallet payment option on there aap .
good services
On 13th Jan, my refrigerator was left completely dysfunctional by UC technician. When he came, the freezer was fully functional and refrigerator had less cooling. But after his work, the refrigerator stopped working completely. I have been a regular UC plus customer, but this has been a terrible experience. There have been three written complaints to UC but no resolution has been provided yet. Since last four days, the Customer Service and Escalation desk has also stopped responding
Service technician damaged the geyser and later we raised the concern n urbanclap team said they will resolve the problem but it been more than 20days, No one is responding to the problem and after raise issue in app & after some its reflecting automatically as resolved. Very very poor and disappointed with the urban clap. Pls careful with technicians as we trusted urban clap service not on service personnel.
Why the hell there is no contact number on the app . Trying to book Nail services from last 15 days and always says the same thing. No slots available
helpfull
They only hire freshers from top tier colleges.
I am very happy with the service provided by Mr. Jasbir singh via video call. He sorted my RO issue with no cost. Thanks to Mr. Jasbir singh and UC team
You can experience one of the worst customer service ever. Just adding cancellation fee on my head for the technician not showing up.
Worst services ..doesn't even deserve to be rated.. pathetic...they have taken my TV for repair in October and not yet returned after 3 months....they have no process that customer can follow up r call them to enquire...where is my TV.. u guys call in 2-3weeks enquire with me about the status.. n than again forget and no follow up...again after 3 weeks another person calls. Where is my TV.. I have lost all patience ..one helpless customer who has been robbed of his TV n Rs 7k.dont trust them.
Very bad experience, plumber took 2000 rs and not attending phone, left work incomplete.
It's always a remarkable experience for any issues I experience......highly recommended.... great and timely service by the company
Since the time I have registered and the companies that they have tie up with, from my experience awful and pathetic. Not one time, they have managed to keep up the quality.
Their rates for salon at home used to be so good but now it's all gone down the drain. They've removed upper lips threading and waxing completely from classic and prime, unfortunately their salon luxe was a fail. I can't choose my preferred beautician anymore and it's all become so expensive. Disappointed and uninstalling soon for sure.
Services in ro repair ,water purifier they are bad
professional work force, convenient app
Best service! Their professionals are highly trained and punctual.
Very difficult to get connected to customer care, Almost wasted 1.5 hour today. But great initiative and most of the time efficient. Needs some work w.r.t customer care interaction in an easy way.
There is no information for painter
good service
Good first experience with UC!
Very easy to use, nice user interface and we'll organised.
They fix up appointmnets and then cancel ... no professionalism
üò°üò°üò°üò° Urban is totally fake and fraud company. Difactive material sale and not replace ment policy. This urban company is very bad and fraud company. My problem is not solve long time, mentally distrub & bad experience this urban company.. üò°üò°üò°
Quick and Quality service....*****
v good
Don't get electronic items or plumbing items repaired or serviced through them. Lots of their employees put fake and used products and sell is to you as new. Problems soon start to reoccur. Stay away from paying their membership fees too. Not useful at all. And when you reach out to their customer care for help, they say it's out of the warranty period which is basically less than a month. Hence they basically keep ranting about the company policy, blah blah..
The service levels have become worst. Cancelled my booking at the last minute multiple times. Their beauticians are being exploited due to which many have already left urbanclap. Do not book any service through this app because they will cancel as they don't have people now due to bad policies
Excellent All in one
their online video call helps to solve issues easier
I booked service for repairing my TV ..UC couldn't allote a professional to attend my service.
Awesome. Thank you UC
Most useless service offered by urban company. Highly disappointed with the disinfecting services. Not at all worth of 1149/. No need to look for disinfection services better we can spray with our own sprayers .
The service is amazing! Though the cost is high, all things are done professionally and the booking experience is very customer friendly as well!
great service overall
She pulling my hair very hardly in under arms waxing skin came out , i suffered for 4days it was paining and also she dint do properly my manicure she cut my nails and again my skin got hurt while she removing skin near to nails i got blood also , after finishing she literally waiting and asking me to give 5 rating this is not first time happening every time if i call any urban saloon person they cannot demand me to give 5star right? This is happens to me it's happening to others also Im upset
Great
Baf
Had opted for painting service Staff assigned but work not commenced as promised. No support from customer care. Requesting for refund. No response
Worst experience with them. I paid amount for insurance but when revisit had to be done. Professional didn't deliver the service. I contacted UC customer care for straight 7 days but they kept postponing and did nothing. Finally i had pay another vendor for the service and my money is wasted in UC. As per your reply, already contacted customer service there was no resolution provided.
I have bad experience with UC, I will complain to higher authorities.
Very bad services given .the technician doesn't know to analyse & repair
I booked to uninstall my AC. Today I came to know Person was highly unprofessional as I reinstalled the ac from a local. 1). the wires were simply cut from both side instead of removing properly. 2). Gas is empty. 3). He told me that copper pipes are useless now where as local guy said they are fine and used them while installation. 4). Refused initially to pack it in the box. Did it after so many requests. 5). No grievance or feedback after 90 days. 6). You can't reach customer care.
They are pathetic and making fool out of customers, do not take their services
One of the cheater company if India .
Poor standards, poor quality
Always charging more nd there is no price tag on spare part..feeling cheated..bad service
Company has a good process and a great app. The membership is also worth it. service experience provided by their consultants till date has been great
Very very cheat company
Wonderful experience
App is super but unfortunately they need to train their staff and should teach manner and time management..I have bad experience with staff all times late and misbehaving all times
Cant seem to find facials anywhere. What is the issue?
nice service
very nice
They charge a lot, saying taxes and minimum order fee, even when the bill is 499 they charge minimum order fee of 60 rupees, which is too bad.
Great
One of worst services, have uninstalled it .They have looted me on hair spa, pedicure services by using cheap products and charging me premium charged.
Excellent work
It is a well organised service company that has efficient people to provide best services!
No way to contact customer care through app for service plan issues
Loved how urban company is growing with their services.
10 year
Poor service. Once you purchase their plus subscription they will stop assigning any service person hence your subscription money is gone.
fabulous. thanks
good
worst .. cheating customers. the toilet cleaner denied his duty and i was charged 50rs for that. What the hell is wrong with the customer care? I won't recommend this app to anyone. worst service. why should i pay the cancellation charge for that person who told he cant do the job.
Issue related to my fridge: Pathetic service from customer care side. From last 3-4 days I have discussed with 10 ppl and I had to explain same thing again and again. On revisit we paid money via QR scan using phone pe to urban club but there is no invoice for that. In one of the revisit the technician asked me to cancel and he will come on the next day. That time also I have paid money via QR scan but bill. It's a symbol of scam or fraud work. This is ridiculous and now UC is not refunding.
Irresponsible company and technicians no responsibility
Good service, fedup of local plumbers arrogance and over budget... Go for it üëç
Good
Unable to book appointment for repair of washing machine. Really fed-up
Vey nice app. Service is too good. üëçüíõ
Best in service
excellent job
excellent
How are you going to fix the issues just by replying back to our reviews? For the same cost, if the work is given to jobless people, it will be well done than a urban company person. For anything we ask, they will say it is not included and pay 1000 plus for extra piece of work. This is total loot!
These UC people charges need to strategize for small repairs. Its also not that easy to reach customer support from the app to discuss about our concern on the service charges as it is mostly technician driven
Worst app No customer care number Nothing They will tell in 15 minutes our team will contact you. They wont contact us even for 15 days.
Good
very good service
Equally good experience in metros and other tier cities
Really amazing and excellent 100 % satisfied
Good services
very nice
Most useful in this times thanks for the service
One of the worst experience i ever had,I register for Geyser fitting from Urban company.Technician who have come has charged huge amount for accessories and the accessories that he got his not that great quality and aftet work done is water started leaking the next day.He did even got clamp if there is a water leakeage atleast we could use that clamp to stop from water leaking.When i called him next day he asking to get clamp from the shop instead charging huge amount.Please take action.
additional care of work is need by the people doing work. floor cleaning is not upto the mark
They are exploiting workforce , boycott urban company
Extremely poor service now a days.. even if the person has not come.. there is no update from the company..
Totally fraud company. The people are ill trained. If you call them to repair, they will screwup complete appliance. Promise of 10k insurance is complete bogus. Company takes no responsibility for quality. Blame game is put on customer to track and get work done, in case of any issue. Don't believe this company, this is complete fraud company. Never believe this company, they are number 1 fraud,
Very bad..no updates at all from service provider ..won't use it again
I am a regular user of this company but unfortunately I don't know what's wrong with this company technician, He has damaged my television and even company people are not responding to my complain as I have reported several times, but i am not able to get proper response, I would like to request my money back which I have spent to repair but he has damaged another part while repairing
Not gud
My fridge got shot circuit because two wires connected each other. Problem identified correctly.
he was very professional .
Doesn't work properly, has bugs in it
This firm has become greedy, short sighted and exploiter of their employees. Have been using this app for four years now I am deleting it. Good riddance.
Good
surprised to see the significant raise in prices alongwith new professional well-being fee. not competitive at all now!.not happy
What happend many services not showing....
Third class app
Fake and marketing lies.
Excellent
Very expensive
Not available in Patiala
ok
The worst professionals you will ever hire.. They don't talk to you in a professional manner when they are late.. Plus this company never paid my refund back for the ac repair they never did two years ago.. I still tried to take their svs today and today for 530 slot person comes at 6 and says what the issue.
Quick Responce ... sending highly Professional
good service. try once.
Good Staff and nice work purformance
Why no predicure for men... They are the one who need it... Please add
I wouldn't recommend people using this service in Varanasi based on personal experience. Thrice my booking was rescheduled on account of unavailability of service provider. The communication was also delayed. They seem very unprofessional and as well as even after week long gap when I reschedule there wasn't any service provider. SUPER WASTE OF TIME
Cheats
My tv had been spoiler by urbanclap , and thy say it may happen whn thy open how is it's so I'm not all stasfied whith them and I would say everyone who is booking urbanclap ask them wt thy will spoil at last , only thy are fit to be good in cleaning and there policy are not said before thy send person to repair or any services in going to file case on them in consumer court and will sure suee them out
No punctuality. I had booked a beautician for 3 PM and she texted at 2:50 PM that she will come by 3:30 or 4 PM. There is no respect for my time and money. I cannot cancel or reschedule this appointment also as now my amount will be deducted. The beautician called me at 3:25 PM asking me whether she should come or not. I had booked for 3 PM and she is asking whether she should come at 3:25 PM. There is no direct contact number of the company as well.
Cons: 1. Engineers/Technicians/Electricians ask customers to take their services privately, outside of Urban Company. 2. They don't provide invoice for spare parts procured from market. 3. They tell and charge hyper inflated price for spares. 4. They ask for cash payment. 5. Difficulty in enforcing the warranty as provided by a third party seller. 6. Not recommended for branded home appliances repair. Pros: 1. Good for petty repair work that cannot be provided by authorised service centres.
Pls don't use this company they will Nicly eat ut money pls don't use I have faced lot of issue I mailed 8 time they simply replaying we wil reslove word but no response
good service
Costly
Good Service.
op
Third class app
technicians took all COVID safety precautions before entering home, did their job neatly with satisfaction to us .
charges in the urban company are very high, In the beginning days of urban company, the charges are reasonable, now they have increased.
Terrible service
very good service good attitude of the technician good technician knowledge promt service
Deceiving Promo Pricing I was trying to book a massage for a promo price of AED 179 (from 199), however on proceeding with payment, the price remained AED 199 and later included a partner welfare fee (which is fine). On calling customer care I was informed the price shows as AED 199 cause it includes 'taxes'. UC this is very deceiving to a customer. If taxes/VAT are being charged, this should be mentioned in the price breakdown. OR your promotional price should say 199 (from 208 or whatever).
good
Nothing on time every time I booked the service would be delay.
Poor service.
All services are highly expensive. It's better to use services from local technician with whom you can bargain for the prices and only pay when satisfied.
A scam company that withdraws from the balance without service üëé
Can't checkout
Worst app torturing customers and their partners (workers).
Worst experience
Would give 5 rating for the business concept but the professionals lack the culture the brand is trying to promote. The last technician cheated by replacing tap spindle for what could be fixed with a washer replacement. Charged more than double the price in market. There is no bill for replacement parts provided. His focus was only on replacements rather than fixing issues.
xüëçdc hall
I am loving their live consultancy feature. Gives you confidence and enhance your technical understanding. And all of it is free. It is certainly going to change the dynamics.
what was wrong with me that I was not allowed to work in Urban Company despite passing the interview due to some adhar card problem, I don't know what kind of people are doing all the work, but I didn't get the job even though I was an ignorant person.
Company was unable to arrange executive for me , so they called me and rescheduled it . But now they're charging me penalty for reschedule for which they're liable . I asked 2 times to the customer care but no one is brothered in Urban company about customer's issue .
No customer service I'm not able to find any contact info in app like customercare number or email how we can trust app where there is not customer service
it's good
superb üëåüëå
Kitchen service is bad.... plumber assigned is rude.... incomplete work done.....not responding properly
I am not able to find the instant tan reduction and oil reduction packages in the app. I had ordered these before from salon for men section. Not able to find anymore
Not sure why they charge extra money even they had given fixed price for specific service. Person comes and charge you huge amount which I don't find good. User is paying for the service which he booked for the price mentioned in UC app and after that Urban company person charge you extra. Disoppinted with the service as of now.
Not able to assign the beautician on time... Very bad experince most of the time... First they are accepting the bookings and when we are waiting they themselves changing fr another day...
If you add a service by mistake, there is no option to remove it from the queue. There should be an option to clear your cart.
wow it was my first time and I got good service
Ur tie up with IKEA is interesting. Pls tie up with Dyson for their vaccum cleaner maintainance and cleaning for Dyson owners
First service....worst experience....!!!
They never have anyone available
Professional masseur.
Nice work!
The service always late for more than 2 hpurs and sometime for the next day. It id better not to pay online at all at this unstable app.
Well behaved persons, but unable to rectify the issue. When i serviced my split ac for no cooling, was told there was leaking issue so they checked refilled and said now its ok. But after few days we were at the same place, called the person visited again and did the same process again but problem did not resolved. So i paid for the service for not getting problem resolved. So kindly call the customer support of the product to get proper service rather wasting money and time. Thanksüôè
The service was better before.. nowadays they have a lot of hidden costs.. the service price is shown as INR249 but charged INR299 instead plus an convience fee of INR49 which is complete bogus as none of the technicians now use gloves or feet covers. The app tries to extract unnecessary additional money from the customers but does not pass on the same to the technicians, who does the actual job.
Professional himself did not come and they called for reschedule.. I said not possible.. They are charging fine 50 rs. now for their mistake nonsense..
Worst service,,not refunding the amount, cheating
People are saying it's very good service I am using Frist time thx to urbenclap
Very nice experience
Very good experience..thorough professional
Fraudulent company. Does not issue receipt or invoice for payment. Does not respond to complaints in a proper manner. Highly evasive, fishy. Fishy reply. Has been taken up a number of times. Fraudulent company.
Superb..... Done the job beyond expectation.very much satisfaction after the job done.
They give only basic services. Not that worth.
Positives: 1.warranty is provided for the work 2. Customer service works okay Negatives: 1. Services are very expensive 2. After Covid, first they added Rs.50 as additional charges and now it's Rs.100 3. They do not provide GST bill for the items which are listed in their app along with listed price. This means their is some theft of GST going on in their company.
Pathetic updating process, assignment of assistants not great, keeping the information posted is sad, after paying the persons who visit you the pmt shows as pending which is really saddest, many more things like this which is definitely below the corporate standards.... Pathetic is the word .....
Very bad experience from using of cleaning of bathrroom. After cleaning also the stains got reflected back and the urban clap is not responsible once the warranty expired that to for 3 days.
Nise
Why your criminal company is harassing the employees.
Three years
Very bad
Their charges are very high compared to market rate. For example we had to replace something in the fridge they charged 960+ other charges for defrosting in costed us 1800 for it.... where as samsung service guy said its 150 Rs. And will be charging 750 for everything together. Better to call branded services instead of these people for repairs.
Need much working time flexibility
good
Good
Too good
Just the worst service platform.
Nice program but suddently became much more expensive and I had no clue. I was been charged or a certain ammount, then today I received a message from my bank of 10 dirhams more auto-payiment . I didn't like that no one informed me in the app or messaging me. I would have prefered that definitely. I also have been told that from January 2022 it's this amount for everyone, but I got charged the 74 on Jan 9th, so I don't think this is the case. Finding another provider now.
Extremely poor service. Prefer local service instead of UC. They are flop show. I booked bathroom cleaning. Got 5pm time. I was fine with it. Service man kept on delaying. Finally after 1.30hrs the service man cancelled the service. My time was wasted. Next time it's better I rely on local man instead of UC
Awesome... Best home service app
Repeatedly crashing
We're pretty impressed and satisfied of the output...I think urban company is great for cleaning and the price is also affordable , I would highly recommend urban company!
Best app
Only bluffing for last 5 days no body arrive my location . After calling they become unreachable . Probably call are coming from customer care. Uninstall the app ..
Very pathetic service.professionals are not bothered to call you if they are unavailable
I booked a tv repair service after using video consultation service of urban. Urban professional told me different reasons due to which screen of my tv showing multiple colors. He shared rate chart for repairing the same and he assured me that tv will be repaired within 04 days and will be repaired in their own workshop. But technician who collected my tv for repair couldn't repair it in 04 days and returned it without repairing and further damaged the screen completely during repair.
Good
Very helpful nice application and quality service
very good
good work
I believe urban clap for 1st time also fight with father for try there service for new experience but experience is worsttt,i booked for tv repair technician told me there is nothing can he repair & charges 500rs but nearby another local technician told me he will solve problem..worstt
Fabulous service and very Safe in pandemic period
Great services ..
The salon girls blabber a lot about my personal life Didn't like it They should mind their own business Not expected it from urban company
Manjunatha (RO repair serviceman) has done excellent service.
urban company is good...pls do try it out
excellent
Initially I was happy to get bathroom service but later for another service booking not getting anything in app. No phone number available. It was free 3 services but not able to book it
Excellent Workmanship.
I am not able to book for facial service in Mumbai. Very strange
very good
fantastic service
Worst service
VERY GOOD SERVICES. THEY ARE VERY PROFESSIONAL & GOOD BEHAVIOR.
UC needs to seriously revisit their Marketing Strategy. The most key elements of making Business Success are missing. They lack in various areas such as Customer (retention, Satisfaction, Support), technician training, communication, and the list goes on. Even the customer support's hands are tied and they don't have the liberty to take decisions. It's ridiculous. Just building an app doesn't solve a problem. This UC is not going to last any longer. I have already switched to other providers.
No solution
Booked an appointment for washing machine repair. The service ppl whom they assign aren't professionals. They don't arrive at time and don't even respond which keeps you waiting for them. UC has to look into this matter if they are looking forward to grow in this competitive world. This is my first time using UC and henceforth ,I will not be using UC and don't recommend anyone in my circle to use. Thank you.
Good app
great service everytime I called
Never get ur appliances get serviced by Urbanclab guy, rather go for to authorsied service centre of Brand...trust me, I am having horrible expernce with them.
Quite Expensive
Initially I avoided UC, but it's a good experience and I would prefer to their services
No resolution for unsatisfactory experience with services
Horrible cleaning, unskilled staff, no proper cleaning equipments,etc.....
Worst app, mentions free video consultation but appointment never booked it get reschedule everytime
Please don't book on urban clap....they show Lower price in app after the repair done they'll ask for double price....there is no other chance to complain into the app about the service man....this people are just looting the money....please do the services with your local people....
I m not using
Ek baar aapke sare customer ko % bhi bata do
Video calling & fault finding service is good
Past 6 months its terrible. 1. UC make you to select the tip of the professional at booking without telling who the professional is. 2. Their refund policy is arbitrary. Membership fee if clubbed with a booking wont get cancelled even if you ask to cancel both. 3. The call centre executives are unaware of the app features and wont take feedback on the app functionality. 4. UC is rating the customer vs serving the customer 5. Geyser technician- after 5 bookings need to do job from elsewhere
nice
Very good app
DISASTER AND DISAPPOINTED
The service providers are great but hte prices are not. They keep increasing prices and start pushing for premiums. Not only that it's hard to call back the service providers that we liked. Many of the customer supports called my beautician while she was attending to me to go to another client and kept calling her even though my beautician kept saying that she already has a client the company does not know how to manage bookings at all.
I got pest control done but still there are cockroaches and fruitflies coming. There is no way to reach out to the customer care. Pls help.
No professional available...
Take appointment one day before salon service but till d time no one appoint for me...n not d customer support call me...for reason Totally disappointment from d team... In fastival time... U gave that type of response..its not acceptable üò£üò£
very good
Terrible PCR service!
Some services need to reduce their rates a bit.
Good
very good service! Bathrooms were extremely clean and sparkling
Unprofessional company Please don't vast you time in this app
The company doesn't treat it's employees respectfully..
1. I got a wart after getting waxed and threaded from the beautician from this app. 2. They also charge extra just to diagnose what's wrong with plumbing. For something that took a plumber 5 minutes to diagnose and resolve, I had to pay 400 rupees. This is outrageous as compared to other plumbers in the market.
Excellent experience
Best application in india
excellent work done ‚úÖ
For pest control you should allow bookings for 1 rk also. Giving 1 bhk amount for 1 rk..... A room of 120 to 150 sq ft is considered as 1 bhk.....it's a fraud from uc....
The fallback. If nothing works, nobody (even customer service) helps, then book your service through Urban Company. Both the app and the website work flawlessly. They do have some problems, like a minimum order value for painting, etc., but at the end (or beginning) of the day, you can rely on them.
A video calling option I availed for refrigerator leakage was helpful. Just switching off fridge for a day solved my problem. The consultation didn't charge anything. Similar experience I had for washing machine repair. Problem was not with washing machine, but with trolley of washing machine was used incorrectly. Thanks to Urban Company which didn't dupe us and resolved actual minor problem. They are the best.
Can't place 2 request at a same time. RO installation and TV installation can't be ordered together. The most terrible user experience.
A person came to me through this urban company to repair my washing machine.. he said 12k needed to get it repair but i thought of second opinion instead of allowing to repair but tge second guy from local shop repaired it for 5k and now its more than a month no issues till date.
Worst company
professional are not reaching on time slot poor management professional making excuses
Good experience well trained professionals
Best
A company which cannot keep its employees happy cannot keep customers happy. It all comes from inside. The way your company has been harrasing its service partners with high commissions, penalties, etc is just unacceptable. I urge all customers to protest and help their service partners get their due share if income and respect. Read article by Karishma Mehrotra over Google.
Great üëç
It was great feeling , very relaxing , excellent service . The entire process is quiet interesting ofcourse.
I Requested U to call me back, but u didnt. Is this type of behaviour U have with ur PLUS Customers ???
Very bad experience. Service is not provided as per schedule.
It helps to find new freelance service providers like beautician or a cleaner. It was very helpful when I had to travel and I did not know anyone in the area at reasonable rates. Few suggestions If I have to attend a function early morning in India. I need to book a beautician early in the morning. Saree draping should have different regional draping options to select in it. I am not able to see last beauticians in the app to re book them. Though the option is there.
There is no option for facial ,as it was earlier in the app.
Nice
Excellent üòäüëç
excellent team work I will recommend to all
Worst home-cleaning service in Dubai, don't recommend it to anyone
Very low quality of professionals. Given them a try multiple times, always been disappointed. I'd suggest you choose a local service provider instead
#urbancompany seriously? Law suite on associates for protesting? On people who made you? SHAME ON YOU! WILL NEVER EVER USE UR SERVICE.
very super service for me in holiday time thanks for this one
Quick service....n good technician. Very much satisfied with uc services.
Good
Had an extremely poor experience of painting .paid.a hefty amount and service offered is pathetic .no follow up easily , the one who had taken the calculations and the job to be done does not come when it has to start for briefing . Stencils sent wrong , almirahs not covered as promised .
This is what you get for repeatedly notifying me for feedback surveys. Dumb ahites. Edit: Uninstalling, they are modern day slave masters.
Third class service booking time professional not came she say it is far but she not listening it is near by stn my home. No one give resolution next day directly assign and we don't won't next day service required. Pathetic don't want to given any rating. Only name is urban company but not satisfied. Not given resolution but calling from morning 7am the executive and ..... My sleep
Absolutely unprofessional hair service provided by so called professional. And, to add more misery, the company refuses to take any blame and provide compensation for the damage caused. Company just provided refund and thousand apologies which is of no use to rectify, repair and recover the damage done. Would not recommend Urban company for any hair service at all.
Must have utility app for last 2 years and counting.
Good
I strongly recommend them! This company has been improving their services over the years. Recently used their video call assistance for a problem with my washing machine and it was very well addressed.
Electrician services in dehradun are slightly overpriced. Everything else is great.
For the first time I have booked service from UC.they have got skilled persons with good behaviour.I am quite impressed with the work. thank you UC
Best service
Amazing!
I am very satisfied with the service.
Till now no complaint.
Extremely poor customer service. Firstly they themselves cancel the booking which you have already paid for then they reschedule it as per their choice and then you have to pay again for the same service and wait for refund for 5-6 working days.
The app is not letting me login. I have taken membership and now I am not able to login and avail services. It says you cannot view this try again later. Tried on different hand sets even but it's not working
I will negative rating for this worst service providers..never ever take service from urbancap especially TV related service...It will take months for them to repair and u never know when they will deliver TV also...worst people..worst customer care support...there is no customer care number to call them.this it self tells you what kind of support u will get from them if something goes wrong...
Booked an appointment 2 days prior there was no update about the beautician no one was assigned and also the issue wasn't resolved. I just wasted my time waiting for the professional and also I wasn't unable to reschedule or cancel the slots weren't available when I was in need!!!
Terrible salary for the manhours and personal investments the workers make to do their jobs and get a measly amount, being an unicorn and still, dont pay their workers more at all, the profits increase and fill the pockets of the already rich but the comissions,the earnings of the workers reduce further more than the time when it didnt hit unicorn status,sad to see urban company unable/not wanting to set an example for others,in the country and abroad,too. -a dissappointed (ex)service user.
service is very good üëç
The overall app and the service is good but it's a bit pricier specially the convience fee and all.
The more happier the workers the more efficient and quick they get the job done . Creating unhealthy work conditions and lawsuits for questioning ü§£ , unicorn startups as yours will fail with huge debt . Have some courtesy towards the customers and the workers . Neither of them both are your servants just cuz they use your service . Pathetic . And such a waste customer care .
I have not liked the fact that you guys have removed bread grooming from Prime & kept it only in Royale... So you mean to say that only people who select Royale can get bread grooming service at home, which I feel is unacceptable. Will be thinking twice now before booking a service! And by the way, since the pandemic has started I have been using your haircut service at least once in 2 months! So by taking this decision, you may have very well lost a good customer! :(
One of worst app in play store.Its never work for me .when i install this app.when I initiate technicians video call 24/7 It will throw alert technicians not available.I have tried more then 100 times single time also not worked.if your not providing service then you should disable that particular option itself.
Pathetic app , and unbelievable company ! Firstly charges are too damn high and demands are not fulfilled as written in their services ! Moreover I am getting more skeptical about their terms and conditions after reading that protest news !
Just like ola they attract people to work with them them give them good money now they slached their pricing and left the people to suffer . All startups are now big fraud company in India , really sad to see these companies fool their people and india just for money
Worthless company. Charges a lot but provides cheap service as they are not paying enough to attract relevant talent. A company that is inducing pseudo poverty in India. Delhi ke thugs their promoters amd managers sitting in Gurgaon office. Please avoid services.of UC and buy or source from your neighborhood talent. You will get better and personalised service .
Heard about how they treat their employees and are we even surprised. The rich exploiting the poor to get richer. Typical.
This app is not downloading sorry I don't like
I have taken waxing service 3 times from UC and everytime whe doing waximg they burn my skin...This time I dont know which Rica they used on my skin beacuse after waxing black patches pop out under my underarms...Pathetic...I will never ever take any service from them even they offer free of cost...I dont know how to cop up with this black patches look so ugly..
I read about kind of difficulties faced by beauticians associated with UC. This is not acceptable, you are a successful company because of them, you must think of them, must care them. You care them, they will care your customers. It is just like give and take. If you would like people to treat you with respect, then you should make sure to treat them with respect too. .... Take Care of them, they will take care of you...GOD BLESS YOU
What's your customer care number? Useless app ever! Don't guide to anything. I was planning disinfection services with them and had some queries about it..but there is no link on earth with which you can use to reach Urban Company!!
Very pathetic service.
Very good app. Helped a lot in a urgent situation.
good app and more such services must be included which will be very much helpful.
Not finding any grievance or customer care details so I can lodge my complain....
No service for printers
Great Service! Deep Cleaning of my Kitchen was performed at par. Better than else.
Paid for electrician services 400 rupees including forced tip of Rs. 50 (without tip, urban clap app will not go to the next step). The so called "professional" technician came and saw the product, and said it's not working, and went back. For that I paid 400????!!!!! Later called a near by local "unprofessional" technician and he repaired it for Rs.70 only. LoL.... This Urbanclap loots the people.
Worst service..... gimmick ads...waste of money....not used scrubbing machine as in ad...
Excellent job
Poor response for settlement of toilet tiles damage
An exploitative app company which doesnt respect the labour and time of its partners.
I was doing well with the tutor partner module but now the partner module was discontinued on this app
So far great!
good srvcs
nice experience every time very affordable and classy ty uc
Worst experience for not getting refund.
Really good
üò°
They kept me dangling for my refund, which they claimed they initiated but never did. I asked for refund transaction ID to ask the bank, they gave me invoice ID, how can bank track payment with their invoice ID? The truth was they hadn't started the refund at all. Thankfully I had paid with PayPal, and they helped me get my refund. This experience with Urban company doesn't inspire trust.
nice app it worked perfectly
good
excellent work by Rohan. Thank You.
Hired for 4 different services, disappointed every time.
Very very worst experience I had.. if u have no staffs then why u where open ur Appointments.. really disappointed three times they reschedule my appointment.. then finally they cancelled my booking because they are not having staffs..
I'm really satisfied with the features and benefits
Poor servicing from professional..i spemt 12k for ac repair...still facing the issue
Very bad service. Service rescheduled to next day even after I told them I will not be available. Unprofessional behaviour
Very bed
I really like the service.its Hassel free and easy to book
Waste urban clap no time sense
excellent
Good professional
Company Followed
I had a very bad experience with this. I suggest you please don't go for their service. I regret for using their service.
excellent staff. job well done. value for money
i booked for instant bathroom deep cleaning package for 2 bathroom,i was not at home ,it was very upset after seeing the bathroom, still strains r there. i didn't like it.waste of money. my maid will clean better then them.
Have booked for kitchen and bathroom cleaning which includes 7 hours work for both, only one person came....work was not satisfactory because he was tired at the end of the day (naturally) Kitchen was super but bathroom are not up to the mark....UC please send required man power if not please don't take bookings....(paid full amount though üòî) Note.... I am not blaming or complaining the person who came...he was good
They are professionals and do complete job
I like their service
Every time it was great experience and the professionals are well trained with great attitude.
Bad experience
Dear UC, Today morning i was booked for AC service for that including all charges Rs. 758/-, as infromed one technician came and he check he told so many things are damaged and ask Rs. 5500/-, and he request to cancel booking also. it is like totally cheated. you should check this kind of activities.
üéâüéÜ
Urban clap or company doesn't matter what name you have for your company. If you can't live upto what you claim. My whole day got wasted professional didn't arrive ..even second replacement was not available too. Poor planning of resources. All these starups have only one aim to have their company valuation up. That's it..they don't care about service or product they cater.
good polite performance.
good
It's gud experience with urban company
Horrible experience... Service prvider damaged the tiles Issues raised on time. Bext service provider does not come. Third one says tiles are damaged i will not touch and thereafter the call center is asking to close ticket, share bank details but NO RESOLUTION !! ABSOLUTELY UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOUR!!
Horrible experience with this company. Not recommended, better find a local vendor for electronics stuff repairs.
Very good service It is worthful,
Good
Very good experience, reliable.
Very unprofesional. I booked for lock installation and carpenter asked for additional money.
The services are ectremely costly they loot from both hands in case they replace any spare part. Big NO for urban company.
Good
perfect
Now Urban Company service has become worse. For one week trying to book for a service either a good professional is not assigned or even after providing a professional, the professional are unable to keep the timing. UC needs to understand that we have our work and changing schedule affects our planning also. UC over the past year detoriated in providing services.
Kindly contact me
Love your app. But you should provide pedicure services for men as well
Technician did a wonderful job
good job
work done is thorough
price should be reduced lil bit and there should be option for party makeup n hairdo
Took the money with online payment but it's been 5 days and nobody showed up for service.
very convenient and value for money
I need Disinfection service for my apt in Bangalore. I have registered on mobile app. However after choosing the service and plus membership fee, the app is not moving further to schedule the service. There is a bug. Very frustrating...also didn't find any customer care number in the app to call üò†
very professional. good quality services everytime
Very Costly hidden charges lot,Don't Trust,Think before Booking!
Very expensive. For every small thing urban company is charging lots of money. Don't go with urban company instead get local worker it will be way cheaper and you will get whole month service for what urban company is charging for just one time visit.
Un professional service
Refunds doesn't happen.. and no option in app to track refunds .
It is pocket friendly and top quality maintaining high standards of hygiene and safety.
Excellent Service
Good
Bad experience
No body is attending 4 video inspection.
nice app
Quite smooth experience, would now continue to avail services from UC
Excellent work.
So far so good no complaints as such... Services were good technician was professional.
No punctuality at all for the professionals in hyderabad...been changing n rescheduling since 2hrs...im guiding and alerting beauticians....then also they didnt turn up rightly....dont ever book in this app
Good work UC Company
Urban clap has a lot of facilities For me it's all rounder
I want to join as beautician but the lady who was taking interview was very very rude to me . This is unexpected behaviour from urban company . We are serving clients our best services but staff is very rude towards beautician than how can we give best to our clients . Please change rude Ladies staff who giving training as well as taking interview for best future of urban company .
Good service initiative. Great help in getting daily simple works done.
Great video consulting Spoke to Mr. Sunil Rohilla for my refrigerate issue. Explaination was very good. Thanks
Good and safe Service at this pantamic time
App doesn't reflect real service charges
Have been only using UC for all household related needs. I have taken the homecare subscription, which proves very useful and reasonable. Go for it... Edit the rating... Off-lately they there have been delays in Salon services... Not few occasions, but recurring...
Good
The technical people those of are working are technically in inefficient
Easy to use
When is my refrigerator gonna be fixed? It's been half an year gone now. 2 Paid services I did with UC and still it's the same. Professional came and went back. Your app says sit back and relax. üò°
Very nice service. You must include 10% tip charges on total billing so customers don't need to pay separately. Another feedbacks are regarding cleaning and disinfection services for offices, villas and bungalows is that please extend area limits upto 25,000 square feet and above because my office and home are both same size otherwise you can provide charges per square feet or per square yard.
Very dissatisfied,have to cancel 2 times, short of man power.I will not call anymore
punctual. professional and perfect service consistent too
It is easy to use app with good professionals
Very bad support and services. I booked for pest control service, 8:30 slot. I did all the preparation in advance and nobody arrived till 10 am. I had to cancel the treatment. Professional never picked up the call. There is no customer support from UC company to handle such issues. Once money is deducted they don't care.
Pls read my review carefully before booking service from urban company!* If there is a chance to give zero stars I would have given that. I booked bathroom cleaning services from urban company. The professional assigned was highly unprofessional and he broke the commode and made a hole on it by cleaning it with a rod. The rest room was used by my parents. They made fake promises to give reimbursement but no response thereafter. They are cheating their customers. No value nothing. I regret.
Bad Experience! Have booked a service and had waited but the professional dod not arrive. Even after contacting Uraban Clap nothing changed. They have rescheduled for the next day but not sure if the professional will arrive.
Urban people said service person will be at 8 am but service person has not turned at schedule time. First experience is very bad experience.
great service
Good but little costly I guess compared to the local guys. Came at the right time and service is good though. I read other reviews, i was afraid initially but in chennai, i guess, good.
App is to good Professionals are different
Pichhle Sajan mere friend na ISI service cal mere dost ki IC kharab kar di bahut gussa üò†üò†üò†
Money gets deducted from their gateway and they ask to wait for 7-10 days, first correct ur website ...trying to mint money. Even when booking with out customer adding to the cart you add some package by default...cust service executive is not effective... please be careful
Chhoti chhoti services mehngi padti he baki badhiya he
Great service, courteous employees.
I have booked the painting services which is fully prepaid but the quality of service is pathatic. They have not only done bad quality work but also spoiled the flooring. The response aganst complain is very pathetic and insensitive .
reliable prices and must have app for metro cities
I have got purchased urban plus membership as I have told i will get first service free and 15% discount of repairs and service charges. They have raised the bill of 2049.00 repair. When I call customer care on Saturday that I will get refund of discount. So, i have paid the bill. Now they are not refunding 15%, which is 308.00. Totally unrealiable company. Call center is also not talking properly.
Always an amazing service rendered by Urban company.
Pathetic experience so far
Really professional. Thanks Urban for delivering world class services.
Not good all the time
I wish I had an option to give them half star.It was such a pathetic n stressful experience for me. Right from the time the booking was done to the job was finished. The technician spoiler my Jaguar fittings in all the washrooms and when raised a complaint the company simply refunded my amt. Urban needs to understand the loss that we have gone through n after multiple calls n follow up they told they will send someone to review vch never happened. PATHETIC WASTE OF MONEY & TIME USELESS
Customer call n services are worst. I have to reschedule my booking twice and evn after that no one came. No one is answering customer care no
company do not provide enough supplies to the worker to clean. it is not acceptable behaviour .
Very convenient and helpful app for all services with good professionals
professional, very neat job, on time..
Unless you resolve the issue of booking can not be done because of your app glitch, I will keep giving you one star. So you can keep removing the one star, won't help much.
I have been using this app since years but post covid hit its very worse, the service is very bad insipite of paying hell lot of money, when I complained about some issues I was facing from the app the customer service did not solve it and its been a week now I'm not able to book any of the services, I uninstalled the app now.. Checking for new apps similar to this but with better service.
I want to book a service to clean jst one room is it possible?
No professional available everytime
This app just changed my life. Be it hair cut, RO issue, fridge or electricity.. everything is just once click away.
Firstly no contact information available on the portal..Secondly no refund made even after 20 days of service cancellation.. Grievance contact available does not respond..Cannot believe they do not display the contact details for the client to get in touch with the. Pathetic service..
amazing
Good work. The team members are sincere
service was good. The lesson: 'Order one service at a time'
Prices charged are high, Rating should be given in presence of technician.No genuine ratings can be given
Worst experience with the UC team
Very good app and easy to use
Now the Quality not as earlier
Despite I am being a regular customer your professional Sridar who was assigned for bathroom cleaning at 10.30am today contacted me in morning and obtained information to reach my house today. Suddenly I get a message that he has cancelled his assignment and your company suo moto changed the timing and assigned different profess. This suo moto change of timing and professional is condemnable. You put your customer at the mercy of your fancy of your professional. Pl enquire and inform
Really disappointed by their payment system, system didn't permit me to use credits, instead asking me to make the paytm which they retreved from their agent who was not fault, now this agent started call me non stop as late as 11.30 pm and then 6 am back to back harassing me, this company is really un professional and harrrass their old customers, when tried calling them all their agents are not available, I will not be using these services anymore.. U lost a loyal customer Urban clap
Awesome professional
Very bad 2 baad safae karae dono baar fully dispoint
Why have you withdrawn nail spa services? I was so looking forward to it. Please please please bring it back. It would be such a convenience.
Ok
Excellent services.
My experience on the front of workmanship is good but on the front of charging for spare parts cost it's poor. Recently for my washing machine the drain motor replacement cost was charged Rs 1350 . Where as actual cost is around 750~800. So the charge for parts is close to two times. UC look into it.
Mai sabitri lama aaj mna helpline par massage kiya par helpline se mujhe koie help nhi milla
Perfect services provided UC
Tried the salon, excellent service!
Good experience
Wonderfull
Poor service
high prices
I did not receive my refund of Rs.1128 yet and teh service was cancelled around 10 days ago. That's a good for a earning interest from customers monry for extra days but extremely bad business strategy. I want this to be excalated and need the refund to ve made ASAP!!!!
Urban company services are too good and staff is also very nice
Just got the home sanitation done. Good experience no complaints.
Terrible by all means! Literally!
awesome
I booked for body massage , but they didn't send anyone .
Excellent Service
Excellent service very professionally done
extremely good so happy thank you so much bith guy's and Urban company üëåüëåüëçüëçüíê
very good
I thought to use this app for men salon. But the review for this app make me to uninstall the app. I really wanted to know that the bad review were replied by urban company which is in same format and the issues were treated and solved. Because most of the reviews I have seen were written about the coustomer service was not to the mark, which doest allow to contact you. Can anyone let me know that the issues of urs are treated and your happy with services.
professional as well as humane. difficult to maintain but did so. They do their best in every possible way.
Great service at your doorstep at very reasonable cost.
Taken many services from Urban Company and have never been disappointed
Awesome
Professional Service
Service is not upto the mark
Service was Cancelled at the last minute.... unnecessarily paid for 1 year subscribe
I love this app
online payments not working
Worst Service
Useless support...difficult to reach out to anyone for any issues...
The professionals are well groomed and expert in the job assigned to them.
Great app and great job by UC. keep it up guys. Best way to get the job done at your door step. will try other works too.
Good app and user friendly
Pathetic
Superb to talking
Wast urban company
Customer support team is horrible. No issue is resolved. They say they'll call back but they don't. They are not aware about the offers and cashbacks. I have been wrongly charged cancellation money and my cash back was also cancelled. This is horrible @urbancompany
Super cool ac ü§© good service
Providing goos services
Good
all are experienced professionals and nice way of taking
Excellent service, very professional and very reasonable.
The worst service ever , Urban company will respond on your exisiting complaint and also not responding on call as well emails also.
Issue 2: faced an issue today as well. Professional did not turn up. Did not take my call. No other professional available as per your support team. Wastage of my Sunday.
Not satisfied UC is providing the same person for cleaning of bathroom and refregerator. We do not prefer to get our refregerator clean by a person who has just cleaned a bathroom. I am not discriminate the people. Just concern of safety and hygiene.
I am not satisfied...
The professional, as Urban Company people called them, gave my mother burns on her neck as her facial streamer was faulty and spat out boiling water. Her skin literally peeled off. UC has not yet responded to my mother's emails and the customer service monotonously goes on about sharing receipt image for a consultation with 1mg( their suggestion) which never happened as 1mg is as slow and sluggish as them. What about her pain, physical & mental ...she may have a burn and harrasment scar forever
I was initially very happy with the app. But recently, I tried to hire an electrician for minor works in the house. However I was shocked to see that I had to book a separate electrician for every single job. The app was asking me to hire 2 electricians, just for changing a switch and installing a door bell! Considering they charge almost 300 for just changing a switch, now I would have to pay another 300 installing a door bell. That's a total of 600 excluding parts! I ended up using another app
Very bad Service
Today it was my first day of taking service from UC and I am very much glad with the service taken..It is highly recommended from my side.Will definitely love to take services in near future.... five stars from my side.... keep it up UC...
Good service
Excellent service
Urban company has denied our booked kitchen pest cleaning service in the last minute since I had arranged all the things from the kitchen..very worst...customer care service also very poor response... he didn't respond properly for my question...
good
Trusted Urban Company for their high class service however I'm totally disappointed with their service this time. Just wasted my money. I would not recommend Urban Company to anyone because of their poor service
One of the worst service ever done by the team, who said to be professional and to be in real. Pathetic service experience.....
Please add complete bridal service. It will be helpful for most of us, specially during pandemic.
Most Horrible experience ever. The professional took my television and he hasn't returned it after 7 days. Further he doesn't answer my calls and has switched off his phone. Customer care has only been apologising for 7 days and no one knows what is the status of my television.
I will sexeryde
Very Professional and a neat job
Urban Company Naam bade aur darshan khote
Good
I will ignore my past experience using your services. Today i used the video consulting and Deep Narayan to my surprise knew how to fix the washing in machine issue i was dealing with and he talk me through very it patiently and politely Well done UC on the training, communication and VC consulting initiative. It was a delightful service i have had in ages.
good service nice cleaning
good
High price. Not working in Guwahati
Excellent
Ridiculous thugs! I first of all someone called me from urban clap and had booked the service for 2 weeks. I can't see these booked services in my app so I don't know if I have any active bookings. Secondly whatever active bookings I had I cancelled them 1 month ago. But today a cleaner landed up at doorstep and I am charged 25aed for cancellation. I checked my credit card statement I have charged 25aed two times before. This is cheating and fraud! There is no number to call and ask.
good job
Had taken bathroom cleaning service from uc many times before, this time very bad experience, they put scratches on director plate, pathetic
Very convenient. Easy to use for most of those convenient with using Uber App. However, a customer care phone no. may be considered for those not so tech savvy
lovely
Great experience! Best Service!
Not satisfied
thank you Urbanclap for providing such a nice service.
work excellent
Excellent
good service
Since more than 20 days my refund is in process..Still not paid and unable to reach the customer care as well..
Cannot update address. Cannot update payment paid status. Cannot cancel substandard and worthless subscription.
equipment should be provided
They handled a crisis situation also well. which is most admired. very good service.
Qualified staff with quality service
good experience
amazing service. performed well by professional.
Can't install this app
Worst service provider
Good app üëç
Bunch of thieves For last 3 years my money is stuck at this useless platform and even after all the proofs they won't return my money. Google play should ban them!!
Thank you Urban Co for organising the unorganised sector of the society and adding value to our lives . Very polite personals and super professional. UC has successfully structured the jobs of maisons , plumbers and corner street services by setting a fair price for service. No more haggling with street side service givers . Thank you üòä UC
Bad service. Unprofessional. The professional did not even touch the appliance and concluded that it's broken and it can't be fixed and left.
Worst app. No way to connect with customer care. They call back when they want.
satisfied cleaning
Unable to book services for different addresses. Even when using GPS the app defaults service booking to one particular address. When I try to force change the address, I get an error stating that the progress will be lost. Why buy a membership when you can't use it.
The worst experiences, they dont keep up the time given.. waste of time.. i have taken 6 months membership and while taking it was advertised that if I don't get the savings i can get the membership back. I have booked painting quotation but professional has n9t arrived 2 times. Waste of time and petrol.. now customer care is saying i can't cancel membership.. it's a trap. Don't go for membership. Worst experience with urban clap till now.. they are not punctual and don't care about customer..
Amazing service always provided!
Useless ,,, no service providers are available in middle of the city
Most unprofessional company, I Appeal to everyone don't take any services from urban company... urban company professional damaged our very costly interior work and done huge loss to our property.. their team is not responding to our calls and cheated us very badly. I spoke to their head, sent several emails and put requests but their team give no response and block on phone. They are running with their responsibility.. they only want business and least bothered for customers.Don'tTake risk... I wrote very clearly that urban company is not resposnding even their team write same reply - pls email to us.. when your team is not not bothered to reply then what is the meaning of writing same reply copy & paste "EMAIL to US" & least bothered for customer. Your team would like to fool customers by one way to write email & other way no respond, I spoke to your head several times but she refused to respond & forcefully closing my query without any resolution.. this is expereice you give to your customers... while talking to your head it means do whatever you want will not respond to your query & blocked our phone so we cant reply on whatsapp neither we can do call to your team. Your are doing fomality on the Google - Just mention reply on email, when i wrote several times & spoke to your team 10 times what else you expect from us.. we have given you all photos of our property damaged, interior damaged several times & your professional also spoke to your team several times & they also given proof for our damaged property & agreed that we have broken customer property then what else you need on email to us.. now only thing left to go to Police station to file police compliant against urban company team... very worst experience & felt very bad writing all this about this company but your team has left no option open for us.
Excellent
I have been using the urban company services, for more than 3 years now. I have noticed a stark change in the behavior and quality of their professionals. On several occasions the professionals comes and they always tell me that the elements are destroyed and it was later discovered that the element was absolutely fine. I would not recommend taking the services as the checks and balances of urban company has become extremely poor. Note by A Dissatisfied Customer
Worst service,no responsibility after service. They are only agents.
these guys are just great
good
good app
Customer care didn't read service and allot service engineer
good
service was Excellent and they were very polite and Good.
good service and customer support is very helpful in resolving complaints.
Service is very good, booked saloon and Auro service. They called prior and confirm the appointment and they done their service perfectly and am completely satisfied
Initially the prices were very reasonable ...but these days they have increased the prices alot and additional minimum fee n all are being charged...small jobs are getting way too costly
Already have placed many complaints and already talked to ur legal n flana advisors who were not able to deal with situation. Stop saying me to change my rating. I would have given zero rating for ur this irresponsible behaviour. I want my charger that's it. Anyhow u ask her to return or give it from your end as you also charge us safety amount on every billing.
Too costly spares. The actual MRP of spares is less than a quarter of the price
It's an excellent professionals doing their job perfectly
Hi, I think you should resume manicure and pedicure services for men as soon as possible. As these services were always available for women during the pandemic, it is really inconvenient for us men not to be able to avail these services for such a prolonged period. And if possible, have a customer care number for us to contact in case the need arises. Thank you.
Bastered I want to pay cash but thear are no option cash payment idiot 3rd class and also not showing my professional
Very bad app..this app is only making people fool and not following there own terms and conditions.. highly disappointed with the referal code facility.
üëçüëçüëç
So costly services
Not good
they don't deliver the SERVICE UPTO THE MARK APP MAIN LIKHTEY KUCH HAIN KARTEY KUCH HAIN
Not good experience at all.
There is no customer care contact ,why is that so ... You claim many things but there is no one for us to contact..
good job
Very bad app koi job nahin milati yahan per sirf Paisa pay kra lete he or jab job ke liye bole to inke pas kam nhi rhta bad me btayege yeh keh kr pagl bnate rehte he mere 1600 rs pay kra liya na job di or na hi pese ritern
Support is very bad. Now a days the professionals are not giving satisfactory service not sure if the training is not proper or the instructions are given to them in such a way. Very Disappointing.
Did not receive refund amount. No updates and cooperation from UC.
Today I have booked for water purifier service , the technician Debabrata Sikder was very unprofessional , rude and decline the service because I have purchased required parts from my own and the guy have missed to earn extra money. Urban company is providing worst service after payment done. Very annoying and disappointed.
Good service provider
0 Star.... Never appoint Rony the supervisor for home cleaning.... he has broken many of my household things and just kept quiet about it.....
Woww mza aa gya
Service is good as per my experience but only one service of bathroom cleaning is not that much satisfied as the concerned service person didn't get his efficient tools like acid or other necessary chemicals to clean the bathroom upto our expectation.
Very convenient clean, no spills at-home service.
Very useful.
Beautician not feeling well nor she is confident enough to deliver her services, very unprofessional and even not well trained,she was here at 02:48pm though have booked her for 01:30pm,she is very messy all my room is completely dirty, water all around in the room,max of equipments are not with her for pedicure,such as nail cleanser,nail paints,etc. Worst experience with UC. It's a request plz train your beautician well,after committing a mistake she is telling me ab galti ho gai hai to kya kre
This app is nice good for parlor service at home ... very convenient & hygienic I loved it its amazing if u only get right professional at your service .
Good experience
good
Professionally smooth and efficient.
Absolutely pathetic. No professionalism at all. Booked disinfection service for 1bhk apartment for 7th Jan. Initially booked for morning slot, their serviceman did not answer the call. Got rescheduled in the evening, timeslot was fixed at 18.30; just now he called up & informed that he is not available. Worse than worst experience.
The professional canceled the appointment n puts it on client tat it was due to us she rescheduled
prices are too high
Horrible experience with RO repair. Their professional destroyed my machine and now they don't reply to my mails.
Good Service and timings..üëçüèªüëçüèª Thanks
what a way of service!!!! simply superb... I could give it even 100 stars
Very bad company. Fraudulent and cheaters. They are cheating the vendors and the customers. Why should one opt their service?
Bad company.
the partner was coughing. pls do not send such people during this pandemic.
excellent job
Very bad experiences with urbanclap. The guys will visit for 250 bucks but will charge you 2500 because you don't understand the issue.
Excellent service.i am regular customer of UC,but today the work of k.v.Balaji is soooo appreciatable. UC should feel proud having such a worker.
rates are high
Excellent
Worst pathetic these people r cheating they are coming for vist saying high price grabbing 199 and running away now a days they are not even showing in app we booked the slot and these carpenters r taking cadh in hand complete rubbish company its becoming.
Nice
Recently we did painting of our 2BHK, the job was outstanding, we are satisfied with the services rendered by company. And they are worth to recommend others to get the job done. The Painter supervisor Mr Kishor Yadav is so cooperative who finished our painting in scheduled time. Thanks.
Waste and expensive. Uninstalled, bad experience.
Sameer was really professional
100% not satisfied.
My first experience with urban not very good.. because the professional is unresponsible ... And her service is not good
The refund has not happened till date ...i have waited long enough nor do we have any contact no to call to .... hopeless
I have taken an expert I have taken the regular maintenance expert it has 3 years experience of hair cutting they cut my hair very nicely and very safely also.
This company is a FRAUD! They sent a layman who damaged my Geyzer. They committed they will replace the parts without delay. My mother is a lungs patient who had to suffer because of thus. They sent many technicians later without informing them what is to be done. They literally harrassrd us.
cost of the service to be reduced as it may increase the customer base.
Over-priced!!
They took my TV for repair with promise to repair & bring after two days,but came after two days saying can not repair but when I checked the defect had increased from 20%to 80%.no explanation given.when contacted the company I was told to get a paid visit for explanation
Very bad company üò°
excellent
expensive with no offer
Excellent
ok
Very much disappointed because it's not your beauticians fault, there not at all professionally trained, this is the responsibility of the company you should hire carefully this is kind of harassment you are giving to customers, just because you want to make money you cant just hire any one like that and send them in a field, stop doing so or else shut down your company.
Urban company is one of the best company with amazing home services .. Polite staff and good behaviour
Good üòäüòä
For everyone and Good and Easy for old Persons especially.
Great service for affordable price..
I booked at home pcr covid test. The maximum time I ever had to wait for a pcr test is 12 hours. However the app was saying 24 hours, which I felt was OK since I would be isolating at home anyway. However, after they came to my house and took the swab, they informed me it will take 48 hours (this was not mentioned until AFTER the service was performed). Now it has been already 60+ hours and no result. Urban company team is totally unhelpful and tell me simply wait more. This is pure theft.
Great app
Excellent and fast service
Excellent service
For the first time I took service from UC and completely satisfied.
Very worst customer service
The service providers were not polite enough when asked their job pattern. Really disappointed with the service and the rates also given compared to how they provide.
I have booked pedicure twice but never got the service at the time of my Booking
nice
Helpful and App usability is good
Worst service...they leave the service midway
No help centre no details for previous services, once your money gone nobody is responsible
Great app üëåüëåüëåüëå
Service partners will hack your account. They'll ask for your phone number with some excuse, trigger an OTP for logging into your account, and ask you for the OTP you receive over SMS. If you say no, they will start lying and make up stories about how it is mandatory. Your personal information is in the account so please be careful. I booked multiple services while shifting, and ALL vendors that arrived for various services tried to do this. They're also never in uniform unlike the UC ads.
spa services is so bad
Cheaters
Reasonable pricing and very good customer experience. Love this
A complete fraud in KSA! Worker doesn't show up and then the confact center, which is a mobile number only doesn't answer! The app wants me to run after the assigned worker directly to trace her whereabouts!!! Pathetic!!!
great job ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
Best services provided by urban company as compared to any parlor in India.cannot live without the services now .totally addicted.
sometimes they charg for services and send professional who are not equipped to handle those services at all
Does not allow clubbing of multiple types of services offers in single booking
Worst behaviour
Fraud, Irresponsible
Service cost is 3 higher than local persons . I paid 1850 for washing machine drain motor. Which is available for 450 in Amazon.
excellent
professional
price is high
Very disappointed
Fed up with promotional msg everyday.
Pathetic Service in Guwahati. Called for Bathroom cleaning, but the cleaner appreaeed for cleaning without any equipment. Almost nothing changed before and after cleaning. When raised cornern, they assigned the same person for revisit. The cleaning person then called and informed that he doesn't have any equipment. When raised concern again, Urban Company said they can only refund Rs. 150 as per company policy. They were least bothered that nothing was actually cleaned. Beware of this fraud.
Money in my wallet reversed, plz issue refund immediately
Excellent app I am joining to last 4 years
I was so happy with app in the beginning as I didn't have to go to salon every 20 days and I could book a service anytime I want. It was cost effective too. However now prices are increased a lot over the period of time and offers are too less. üòû
Very nice APP
A little costly but worth it. Good service, professionals at work and the equipment is also very well thought out. Doesn't leave out any mess at the end.
Kadkkk na bhai log
I took appliance insurance from acko from urban company. No one visited ny home and in the app it is showing my service is done. Terrible app.
Op
Urban company will take bookings but they dont have enough professionals....when they dont have enough professionals then y they take bookings.....
can get all services with reasonable prices which are necessary for domestic and corporate purpose.
Amir did a great job
Supar
Good service
Uc per month leads 113 but some leads not including my hub Its fake to all patners.
Recently I booked geyser service in Urbanclap. Service executive visited my house and checked the product and told, heating element, Gasket and multi function valve is not working and need to replace it. As per the Urban clap rate card, he charged me after changing all the parts. After that, when I compared their rate card with market price and found that, they have charged double the times Higher cost for each spare parts. When I spoke to customer care, I didn't got proper response
they dont provide services on the weekends. and show option for booking in app but then cancel the booking n suggest time which you dont want. i will never use this again
very useful app for day to day tasks and utilities in today's hactic world, it is not always like high quality service is costly than local vendors. When you try service like UC it is more profitable compare to local services.
You r sending nonskilled persons they are spoilling originality of our bathrooms etc pl dont send such type of persons they r spoiling u image
Super
Good app
very good
good
Best service ever üôå ‚ù§
Very Professional and neat Service..value for money
They add no value to the service providers they sub-contract. Incredibly frustrating company. Go direct to the source and save the time and hassle. Should not be allowed to operate in the manner which they conduct themselves.
The charged me membership money and canceled the service too. Now when i am requesting to cancel my membership they did not do that either.
Good
Good service
I really appreciate urban company home salon services. All beauty equipment are sanitized and clean. Staff is wearing mask and used gloves . Urban company provides great health and beauty services at door step with reasonable price . Go for it.
Verry bed service urban company
They show booking timings which is not available and charge for subscribtion. The call centre executives are rude and do not give any kind of solutions. My experience: I paid online and booked a professional for 2pm spa services; the professional refused to accept then I get a call from 'Deepak Sinha' (call centre executive) that she's available for 4pm I asked for 15mins to rearrange and schedule and then he told me that she has been booked for 3:30pm for another customer. How is this fair?
Extremely unprofessional and irresponsible plumbing services, the plumber assigned were totally clueless about what was to ne done,and did not have the basic tools to address the complaint made.I was charged more than the quoted sum and was promised to get a refund for which I AM STILL WAITING.
she is good and professionally fone her job
good
Thank you so much Javed for glamorous haircut of my nephew ..he really liked ur company nd also the haircut u did .....once again thank you so much üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè

all products and services inturment provided to sarvice to coustomer
I have taken protection plan and paid rs1870 and still no one has come to repair my fridge. Very bad service
Worst experience, still service personnot came. Not receiving call, when received call refusing to come. Worst experience.
A one
Very good service we called them for cleaning purpose they done excellent work thanks
UC charge to customers unnecessarily, professional do not reach on time. Professional do not wear uniform and also they use local product. And price are too high
Very cheater company, the service engineer is broken my ac top cover. I have raised complaints but I don't get any solutions. And here I am able to see lots of fake and paid reviews.
Worst
Thank you so much, Excellent (washing machine vedio call )
Prices have increased even if you take membership
I booked a guy for cleaning today. Called him 10 times but he did not pick the call even once.
Third class sarvice
Not service provider success full totli machinic frod
U guys take unprofessional people for work....... Its better to go the parlour
Old water stains are still visible on the tiles even after cleaning
Very good service provider
Very worst thing happened to me. TV technician took the TV and spoiled the display. And complained to urban clap. Initially agreed for the alternate technicians. Now no reply, nothing. Please do not think to use this. Better go and find nearer technicians. Or You will loose the product and money too. With irritating services. Am finding way to go for legal complaints.
Urban company is best
Very bad customer care service.. After raising 3 tickets my payment issue is still not resolved..
Worst experience with them firstly I was happy that urban company started there service in my city and I took one year membership and one simple bathroom cleaning service they assign me a so called professional and I gave a time slot of 8 am but he didn't came and I called him then he started giving excuses then I again reschedule the booking at 11:30 but they were not having a professional available at that time Just tell me when you are not settled properly why you started you service.
very good timely service following covid guidelines
great app. need real time edit and invoice if any updates in app.
Technical issues with app everyone I have to uninstall and reinstall to use this app, otherwise services are great ,worth charges!
It's a best app , service is very good and all are professional , they maintain good hygiene and puntual .I did my haircut and it was awesome.
Multiple worst services ever faced. This kind of service cannot be tolerated anymore.. Please make sure to satisfy the customers when they are paying you.. Atleast a response is needed
Customer service needs improvement Rest all is good
Unprofessional person not worth to be in urban clap. No response
Best app
We rely on Urban Company for every services. Very professional and great work!
Finest App
I booked an bundle AC service where I had 3 services per year, after the first service is done you won't be able to book the second, third services. Scam
Good service by amrutha. Felt very relaxed after head massage.
good cleaning of bathroom by aman
charging higher price where you compare outside cost...only thing they can come on time
Excellent service.
very bad behaviour
The app's UI is not the challenge, but it creates alot of issue to get the payment through. There were multiple failed attempts and deduction and then urban company doesn't have a very good refund policy and customer executives which eventually makes the consumer keep running after them to get the refund.
Very bad experience in Mumbai..inspite of booking with intense 10x stain removal the professional who came did not carry any equipment to clean floor... I had to cancel the booking.. and got missed call from the company instead of customer service follow up and message that we tried to call.. this is ridiculous and unprofessional
Professionals are good but services are costly
Unreliable, booked a pcr test that never showed up. Called customer support and they couldn't help, reach the professional or replace the professional. First and last time - I don't even know why I tried a PCR service other than Justlife, at least they always show up!
It was worst service, I have just wasted my money with you.I am a new customer and purchased global hair colour service on November. It didn't last 15 days and you sent your agent for revisit. He argued with me for 1 hour and told me it's the process that after taking global colour I need to do root touch up within 15 days.First he told me that it will last 3 months but in 15 days it faded. Your agent revisit for global hair color but he did root touch up which faded within 5 days, sent you pics
It's always good. Requesting urban company to start advertising in Aurangabad as the services have already started but very few people are aware about and expecting all kind of services here soon.
Nice
good amazing
Well Good Team work.
Best work
Best for all your needs
Good service
good service
Worst Experience. No proper Equipment provided to staff. Descriptions in App are completely misleading.
Superb Serviceüëç
good consultant app
UC is not doing any background verification of their professional so it's Very risky to allow anyone in your home. They could be criminal, you don't know. I'm telling this coz I faced this issue other then that they are very unprofessional. I booked UC service 4-5 times but my experience with last couple of times are worst. They will beg you to cancel the booking and then charge for visiting your booking. Mark my word thier support team is worst in world. You will not get any support from them.
good and neat work
Unfair trade practices

It's not downloading i checked everythg in my phone but still not. Stopped in 92%. I can't even use the services.
Overcharged heavily for a service that took less than 2 minutes and no spare parts.. trust your local technicians and vendors instead of a company that is looting it's customers
So far... I had two services here, but the problem is.. after booking a service, the total amount varies from the amount which shows before confirming the service.
Great app for home services
Poor service
Amazing service üëè
good
Pricing has changed drastically and not worth it for the service they offer only few of the professional know the needful others are uttar waste. Prices Salon services are sky high for a hair spa they charge 2250 (pre wash,no post wash and dying is not included) all they do is apply the cream.
wonderful
Worst customer service and bad response from the team. The professional was very waste as he does not do the job properly and after any problem arises he will not respond. He asks money from us to purchase items for work. Better to spend that amount for local plumbers. Unnecessary waste of money, time and unsatisfaction
Day on day they are increasing prices and decreasing the time of therapy. 299 for a 10 mins head massage is horrible. I'm uninstalling uc
They are running fraud. They do not take responsibility for the guy they send. Do not trust anybody they send.
Plumber you sent was a cheat, over charged off line, rude. Plese introduce quality check
Good
worst app. bad services by uc
Not as professional as expected. Dont follow given schedule time. A Technician forced me to give five stars on his behalf, which is weird behavior. I was been neither given a bill or any invoice against the amount I paid Rs.1200 cash even asking several times for it. I think the technician did some goof-up. Probably cheating. The technicians were phusy to make me the payment done either by Gpay or cash, don't encourage to make payment on UC. Skeptical,risky and highly unprofessional.
Worst company to deal with. Very unprofessional a d give you false promises and charge you full amount. False data shown on the report of the PCR. DHA will be urgently notified as the test date mentioned is a whole day late.
Techinicians are cheat
User friendly
Professional fees quiet less as per the work per service at door step. Also, this has made my service request canceled by Urban Company b'coz of not availability of Professional in that quantity in each area.
No way to contact support. Same address shows no service from one account but it's available on the other account.
Good
Good service, executive was professional and polite.
prompt service. Technician is having good knowledge about the product.
Have had terrible experience with urban clap with it cleaning services. I have made the booking twice. The professional called and gave medical excuses multiple times and requested to cancel the opening. The worst part is that it's been more than 20 days they have not refunded the booking amount. Please don't make any advance payments rather opt for post payment.
Very good
Very bad service
This is very pathetic experience with urbanclap service. I have been booked two times for field visit but they always keep fake promises to customer that will Engineer assigned for tomorrow and after 4-5 no visit happened and customer has to cancel their booking.
wonderful service and polite service
iam unable to book any service or unable to call cousmter care
Super
kitchen cleaning is not very clean. bathroom cleaning service is best
For the first time im very satisfied hope to deal with the same helper next time (Analyn) thank u
There is no option to reach out to customer care without a booking.
App is very good but rates are very high, make it reasonable n affordable
I tried prime salon service and it was really awesome, you must try this app
behaviour and good work always appreciated
Very bad I made monthly offer and they take money in advance then they didn't bring any lady for cleaning only one time
Totally unprofessional. Had booked classic full home cleanup 3 Jan, 8.30 am.Booking canceled by UC , rescheduled to 2 pm, but 2 workers reached only at 3.30 pm.It was promised to send 3 to 4 people for 200 minutes. With tenant scheduled to reach next day and work not done have decided not to depend on them, our entire society of 1500 flats. And worse is UC has become so big, that you cannot talk to anybody
Such a pathetic company Urban clap you must be ashamed of calling yourself as professionals. Why did you accept the booking when you can't find someone who can deliver the service. When asked for refund its been told tha it will take 5 to 7 business days. You people are uncultured ü§ß hopeless money beggers. Shut your company if you can't deliver services with professionalism
Perfect for everything
Very good
Awesome service provider company
Not for the App. Advertisements on the TV are totally misleading. The professional who did the cleaning work for my house did his very best and very hard working. But I would say had he been given all the fancy equipments they show only on TV the results would have been better. Don't get carried away by the fancy ads.
Service is very costly. Not satisfied with the service and solutions provided by professional. Instead I've got better services in local shops and that too in cheaper price. Will never ever recommend this application to anyone.
video consultation service by urban clap is Fantastic
Price changing every booking. Looks like they are taking too much advantage on services.
I recently booked a service for a plumber.. Uebanclap charges for even smaller things which are unnecessary. If I call some individual plumber they charge me 350 to 500 rs. For everything excluding material cost. Here they were asking for 900 rs. Plus material cost., Which is double. It's a suggestion to do not charge this way.
Good sarvce
excellent
Excellent
Salon at your door stel with affordable price and safety.
Quick and effective services offered most of the times. Pricing is a bit more for some minor services.
nice experience
I am trying to get the disinfection for my home since yesterday morning.. twice it has been recheduled.i have my much elderely parents living alone.. inspite of telling them this just rescheduling .. never expected this from them..
Great app, makes the job fairly easy ! Edit: The video consult service is wonderful !
I love the service, but my concern is with the app. it did not ask my consent to read the OTP SMS. I strongly believe this need to be reported and you should not access any of the private data without the users knowledge.
Used your pest control services, it's an utter waste. After all the labour and pain the owner has to go through, these cockroaches have appeared within 4 days of your 2nd follow up. I'm NEVER NEVER NEVER going to recommend this service to anyone. It's a nightmarish ordeal to put every utensil back in the kitchen and the result is that there is no relief even for a few days forget about few months. Also you should be very clear upfront that ALL utensils and vessels in the kitchen need to be remov
Good
Great service by Urban over the call, the issues was resolved within 5 mins
The complaint option was removed, now I am not able to contact customer care for any issue Not happy with Urban company, not customer oriented.
Worst service no customer care support and work not done properly by professional, if u want solution there is no solution from there end..
Very convenient and trust worthy
I really thought my experience would be great as per my friends suggestion to go for urban company...but it's terrible than an ordinary professional. And it costs too much and I'm done exploring these apps claim to solve our problems
They take money from your account without authorisation for subscription renewal and don't reply to customer emails asking to cancel before it.
Fawzia was very good with facial care , but in eyebrows threading she was not that good , at the end I was not satisfied with the eyebrows but very satisfied with the facial care
Good
Booking acceptable but service not available waste of time my4 booking was cancelled because beutician has not assigned
Same professionals come and they neglect our relationship and responsibilities and work is halfly done with creating a new issues
Good. The Person came on time. Cupboard lock replaced well. Madhapur, Hyderabad.
good service
I am not satisfied with the UC as I asked for classic bathroom cleaing for 2bathrooms I paid 750/- after watching the video in UC about sparkling clean but my bathrooms had no difference infact I can wash better using Harpic, not at all satisfied with service.
I had a terrible experience with urban clap. They cancelled my prebooked service just 1 hour before my service timeslot and wasn't willing to provide me a convenient timeslot ..it's impossible to reach them on call n when they call back they just arrange another callback .this hapend 5 to 6 times and finally without my permission rescheduled the service at 8 in the morning
Urban company is very good platform for all day to day help required,the time slots provided are suitable. The professionals are polite and good in their work. Thank you UC .
I m trying to download it since last 4-5 hour's i m unable to download it
she is very nice, work is good,
The issue remains even though the technician was polite and on time.
Price very high
Adds all the extra extra cost on customers. For even simple jobs, the prices are too much.
Urban company personal came a little bit late to perform assignments
Pathetic
The company is worst not good the app works but the service is not good. I am not happyüòû.
lovely n very professional
Uninformed unnecessary cancelling
Now a day professionals are not coming on time. We have to once reschedule booking and today have to cancel booking as professional didn't turn up even after 45 minutes of schedule time.
It's very excellent app
All service charges are too high not recommended to anyone No customer care number in app
Initially urban company was really amazing. But now they are super overpriced. Each and every service is too expensive. They add convenience charges and so many other charges. And when they offer sale they purposely keep the original price too high and make customers think that they are giving discounts. Wherein the actual price after discounts is same They should cut down there prices.
Good Service Value for money
good but expensive
Why do you guys overcharge everytime. Sometimes it's sanitisation charge.. sometimes it's minimum job charge etc.. One way or other you are looting us on the final bill. Being a member makes me feel like an idiot to fall for such scam.
Very good
The worst app I have come across till date. They confirm the booking without assigning the professional and then when a customer consistently followed up on the same, they let them know that the professional is not available. Highly disappointed. These guys will only end up spoiling your day. Don't trust Urban Clap. They have stepped on all the fields with no man power and zero experience in customer service.
Excellent service. Professional approach. Transparent. Polite .
urban company has done wonders,it houses profesionals who are majorly good and professionals for sure.
very nice
labor charge charged double
Third Class App I Booked A Men For My Bathroom Problem But it's showing 40 rs tax and also it is showing that it is available after 2 days Third class app pls do not install
It's been 3 times now - always professionals don't seem to be available in my area. Just to clarify that I stay in Hebbal - a fairly central area in Bangalore. Checking 'Notify when slots are available' doesn't help either - at least for the last one month no professionals are available I reckon. Disappointed.
good job
Good fast service from UC
Very Very bad company they are not professional and they are sheeting i device all people don't use this application use other application they took mu money for nothing no one come to my apartment to clean it .
What a fantastic app and service, i have used it for home cleaning and beauty services . Amazing professionals , house and bathrooms were spic and span after cleaning , beauty experts and masseurs are knowledgeable and well experienced. Will recommend urban company services to all my friends.
You know how they profit? The motor of my LG washing machine costs rs.1200 in the market, Urban Company charges a fixed cost of rs.1800 for these motors. I thought I saved 300rs on visiting charges by using Urban Company but No, I wasted extra 300rs.
My experience with Urban Clap was really good in fixing the problem.
Get the service what you want, with transparent and affordable pricing.
I booked my hair cut appointment and task is assigned to asainee but at last moment my booking reschedule by assignee without my consent. Bilkul bakwas services h.
very expensive
very prompt and speedy service. technicians are knowledgeable and work cultured.
Very much disappointed
The company has overnight increased price substantially...from Aed 89 for a Mani pedi...its now gone to AED 125, for the very same services with no change whatsoever in the quality of professionals sent. They also suddenly started charging a mandatory AED 7/- for no reason. It says that it goes towards the welfare of the partners which is rubbish because as customers we have no way of knowing where that money goes. Not sure if it is even legal to force a mandatory payment like this from customer
Very helpful and user friendly app with professional services, Paisa vasool deals.happy costumer
awesome superb
Biswajit Das deserves a TEN STAR rating... people like him... enhance the brand name.... thank you... Urban Company Shantanu Banerjee
All the technicians are not genuine although a few technicians are good. Hence you've to be cautious while choosing your technician.
Costly
Fantastic cleaning work by Khandu and his team. My house was locked and not in use for about 15 months, so in pretty poor condition. Khandu and his team cleaned up my entire house and its contents like new. All this in 6 hours, and for about INR 5,100/-. It would have taken me ages had I done it myself. I would highly recommend Urban Company to folks who are in a situation like me: just sit back, relax and let UC do the work; TRUST ME, IT WILL BE MORE THAN UR MONEY'S WORTH! üòá
good
easy friendly
helping me a lot with ac service & washing mechine issues
Worth paying for their neat and tidy work
I booked UC for washing machine repair.. Service provided by its Technician was really excellent but the charges of spare parts supplied by UC was too much..
Piyush did excellent job in resolving my query online, excellent service üëè
super cleaned..
Very poor customer service..all experiences are bad
Good service
Good sevice advice
Cheating.. No clarity on the type of cleaning and the person rejects saying we need to choose another category of cleaning and left without any progress. They are worried abt the rating could be affected. When escalated with their manager they too suppoeted this fellow. No provision to register a feedback. Waste of time. Uninstalled the app. Hired a local vendor and did my work with perfection. Dont fall prey on seeing adv. These are worst pracitce by this UC. Hate.
This company deserves 1star only because they don't have value of their partner they only listens to their coustomer and fall our rating they don't ask us that what issue was happened why coustomer has given you low rating evertime it's ont just our fault sometimes it's coustomers fault to . So before Falling our rating down just talk with coustomer and your partner to it will make your company to grow more. Every womens are depend on you so before Falling rating make sure .
Deputed technician for refrigerator repair was really a professional in this field and with a nice behaviour.
First time I availed the services..its wonderful..my bathroom become brand new...
excellent
Don't use too costly, worthless. I have booked for tv repair, I connected through video call, he said will charge around 1800 after that i booked technician with paying 450rs, he says will cost 5000rs. I told him, they mentioned in call is 2000 after that he started bargaining, finally closed at 3000rs. I feel Waste of money using urban company.
No clarity of deaceiption
amazing
Good service and support
They are fake company making fool of common man
Uninstalling the app as the video troubleshooting option is only available in hindi to me. After having call with your support member came to know English option is only available in southern states of india. For all others hindi is the only option which feels unfair and feels like there is an assumption/requirement of understanding hindi.
App is working fine but the service was very poor. All robbers has been employed in Urban Company as Technician. Recently I have booked appointment for washing machine water drain problem where Technician found that drain motor not working and quoted Samsung washing machine drain motor price as 1500 plus fitting charges as 300. When I enquire outside found out Samsung original drain motor cost is just 400 rupees. Technician allegedly quoted extra 1100 rupees.
it was my first time !!!and professional was really up to the mark...I really enjoyed the service üëç
Very bad service. Booked it for third time.no professional assigned.every time I get a call we don't have professional we would want to reschedule but no one comes on the day of booking
Good app for service
Great utility. Ensures professional services with professional behavior. Also, please include gardener services!
Great service
Nice can choose hasstle free
Worst terrible experience, booked and confirmed 4 times and cancelled last moment. They still had no shame in calling and asking to reschedule for 5th time. I would rather have 1 commitment for later days rather than being giving false commitments for immediate bookings and then cancelling it. Dont waste your time after them as there are so many better companies around ready to offer services and thats also at better prices. This is what happens when you have name and fame, you forget customers.
Very Very Bad Experience. Never ever in my life will I use Urban Clap . Do not take customers for granted and create fights in our home
Video call service is good
wonderful experience, work got done perfectly as per schedule
Extent service
There is inconsistency in services. At times services are wonderful and at other times they are bad. With this much extra charges I would expect consistency in services
Good & timely Service
Good service üëç
Had a horrible experience with monthly subscription for chef service...after paying for trial I enrolled for monthly subscription..that cook had emergency and he could not come...UC didn't even inform me about it, after multiple follow up I was given a replacement...that come didn't turn up for another 3 to 4 days...the cook was booked till 6th, and today when I am calling the chef he is like UC has told me not to go to your place starting 31st...UC hasn't even informer me yet...
Professionals are not punctual. Phone connections are too complicated, calls not possible. There's no one to tell status.
Bad at keeping commitments. Service providers often arrive 2-3 hours late and give bad excuses. Customer service people say "Future is uncertain, no commitments can be given for the future"
Good job
very bad service...booking car cleaning for last 3days and nobody at desk can solve issues.Have been using uc frm.2yrs..but it was a really bad experience this time.
Payment gateway is not working, i shared the screenshot still no response and offer's are not applicable.
I am not able to download this app, at 92% it stop downloading.
App and Price. 1. Whenever I open make your own package section, this is the 20th time I tried to choose bit each time it drags to close completely. 2. I see a good hike on the prices and membership doesn't give much returns or discount.
Too much addl fees for Service. What's the logic behind charging minium job fee and convenience fee FOR PURCHASE OR SERVICE WITH Learners Board Technicians. THEY ARE HURRYING TO FINISH THE JOB FOR CATCHING UP THEIR NEXT JOB.
Excellent service, thanks
Bad charge me without sending cleaner on last minute improfessional
Practically, their service/quality of chemicals/quantity has been deteriorated and prices has gone up. So, other options to get it done using local people is better as 75% cost saving is there and that too without any quality issue as original chemicals will be given by owner to local guy. UC has very lesss control on the quality of chemical being used in reality at ground level.( have seen it twice now). So, better to go for local /known guys to serve us instead of UC guy.
irresponsible and not customer friendly...even after complaining 3-4 times neither the complaint resolved nor anyone called backd
very good üòå
Good
Highly unprofessional. I had booked services from their salon section and inspite of booking being accepted no professional turned up. When the professional is not available at a particular time why is that time slot option given to customers to chose from.!!
Rude customer care
I had booked for saloon services for 30 Dec 1030h. I didn't get any professional assigned till last minute. When checked up, UC said they need to reschedule it n did it for 1630h. At about 1630h, again I get a call that they are on the job n finally at 2030h, they expressed their inability n rescheduled for 1630 on 31 Dec. They failed to assign any person on this day too n cancelled my appointment. A huge set back for my new year eve.....
Excellent
Booked salon service & got call frm Profesional stating she will be little late which ws fine bt she did not turn until night and when I chased her she said that she have rescheduled it for tomorrow. When checked with executive they rescheduled it for next day and again no one turned up stating they don't have products again rescheduled and urban failed to deliver service. Whn they can't deliver service at clients preferred time then no use and they have failed big time. Worst service provider
very good
No words excellent üòÑ
Recently did a cleaning service where they charged higher price for a different service than what is provided and the chemicals used has made permanent marks on granite in both bathrooms. Very poor customer care support and not refunding and not compensating for loss. Will raise issue in consumer forum.
Cancelled my booking at the last moment. Always had the worst service experience.
Worst company ever
You guys have charged ‚Çπ500 to hang 4 pieces of wall decor that too one was a dream cathcher, one canvas and a mini buddha painting. So unhappy with the overpricing of your services. Really unhappy... Didn't expect this from your company atleast. Is it humanly possible to charge someone this high... Your experts didn't even inform me that it will be ‚Çπ100 per piece. Just putting nails is charged extra like ‚Çπ10. If I would have known that I woulf have hanged the pictures myself
Poor
They were really reduculous while doing the full home cleaning job. We have paid premium package for 1bhk, the professionals came without deep cleaning machines and they were only on the phone. They have wasted so much time. It is not atall worth of the money we paid. Very very bad service.
Great service team !!
good service indeed
Very good and timely service. Technician is expert and well behaved. Will continue with UC in future also. Hassle free and peace of mind.
Not at all reliable! Despite scheduling the booking, it was rescheduled by the service provider without taking in the requirements of the customer!
Amazing experience... Quickey done
Atrocious service. They lie on their app regarding warranty and services, totally untrained workers who just spoil your device instead of repairing or servicing it. Customer service is appalling. Get your act together
Nice but expensive
Bullsh*t, if professional is not answering there should be an option to change him, it's not there. Cancelling charge 50rs is not fair. Reschedule option also has issues not able to proceed.!
Urban company says everytime if there is any issue request a call back but the matter of fact is that there is no option to request a callback! LOL biggest set back for UC I'm facing issues with my booking since morning today but I cannot opt for any help because there is no option as FAQs are of no help. This is going to lead the company towards loss of income. Hope there is a solution implemented soon.
No cutomer care number to solve problem.
The worst company ever, after they confirmed the srvice and took the money on the day of the service they canceled my booking and suggested a dated after 2-3 days which impact me strongly Never deal with them
Very bad and experience with urban company. I have mention new address in service than also techincian went to old address and saying we work through location not on address. This is type of behavior didn't expect from Urban clap. Very very bad experience.
Nice technician
Nice service.
I hate ur service
Professional denied service by wasting my time ... UC earning money by penalty on professinal..
Good and Quick Service
work done promptly and efficiently.
The professionals for home salon services are not assigned on time. No genuine attempt was made to assign a professional for the booked time. The professionals for kitchen deep cleaning services have no clue what they need to do despite high charges. New steel vessels were stained with chemical. Kitchen cleaning professional stole few items from the kitchen. No refund was provided for theft and poor kitchen cleaning services.
Few months ago my bathroom cleaned by your UC company.The person came with little amount of che.icals and so few portion was untouched by brush.I repeatedly tried to contact with the person but failures to contact. I am83yrs old lady,living alone and willing to cleane again but after giving order to UC,got no reply.So I have bitter experience about UC.Sorry.
Waste of time Worst app
Very poor service, seriously they started cheating the customers, please be careful.
Why am i not able to enable your app on phone?
awesome service at competitive price.
good
Charges are way too high.. with no transparency..
Don't do any booking with URBAN COMPANY they are scamming the customer. Don't take any subscription as they are will charge extra showing as minimum order charges and scam the customer. They don't any sympathy against customers complaint. They take prepaid order and the professional don't show up. Amount is taken immediately from customer and in case of refund even after 7 days they don't refund the amount they are cheating customers. This is fraud company.
Compliments to UC for providing courteous, reliable and professional service.
These companies are looting India and it"s employees
vary good
Not so good as customer care is not professional and service diacribed in menue is not very transparent, charges not transparent.
spare part price in market and what the rate card has more difference the prices are almost double
in Kanpur very less availablity
professional service
nyc
Overall experience in using the app was very good.
Awesome Work Done By Professionals Who Are Polite And Very Understanding ... üëçüëçüëç
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! THEY PUT FRAUDULENT DESCRIPTIONS ON THEIR APP JUST TO TRICK CUSTOMERS. called for an room heater repair and it was clearly mentioned that glass rod provided at no extra cost. But they wanted to charge me Rs.500 extra other than the Rs. 378 service charge when the professional arrived. WASTE OF TIME AND DEFINITELY WASTE OF MONEY !! Never
Not satisfied with work..üëé
Excellent Service attitude & prompt response
very use full service I am very happy
Timely response
Pathetic company, they don't have even call center support if there is any issue during the service.
Used the service when I return home after almost 2 years.. too good service .. from timing of the visit to quality of cleaning .. too good ..
Total waste of time and money.Please don't book for cleaning services.Daylight robbery.They will promise a call back and never bother yo do that.No one responds back
I am not satisfied company
Why are my reviews removed ??? YOU GUYS PROMISED to send the profrssional in 48 hours..It's more than 5 days now. Also, After 3 months of payment made,my work is still not completed. I NEED A FULL REFUND .
Horrible
It always throws an error code saying can't find scheduler map for chennai. Unable to schedule appointment
Very poor service
I had booked intense cleaning service for bathroom for which they came half an hour late and that too without the machine .due to this i had to cancel the service and now for no fault of my own, pending cancellation charges are showing due in my account . This is my second bad experience with UC wherein for my first service in diwali the professionals didn't arrive at all. There is no point in giving second chance to them. I only want the cancellation fees to be removed from my name
I like your services, three suggestions 1. I find quality of service lower in greater noida. Having quality service here for everything will be helpful. 2. Can you start pet grooming/ bathing service for winters 3. Add a general comment section on the app for which i am writing suggestions here.
My experience with urban company hasn't been so well.I took AC repair service and the service was really unsatisfactory.
Done a good Work
Fantastic Service
Very bad service
If u don't have the enough beauticians why do u show the slots open and when the customer book it.. u yourself reschedule it..also most of your beauticians are not professional at all
Costly but they provide great professional service
Very bad. Cannot open video consultation page. No customer care number.
Pathetic professionals want to come as per their own convenience and ll ask you to reschedule every time. Their support team ll not be even able to support
How to become a partner
Too expensive. Better to get local person to fix the issue.
In today's time when other online company's rarely care abt customer service, Urban Company offers the best by far. You guys hv raised the standards very high. Cheers! Super satisfied customer üôÇ
Was perfect
Terrible service, I got the geyser coil replaced with 1 year warranty, it's not working in just 4 months, now the service person is not responding and there is no way to reach company.. very bad experience, don't go for them, prefer local repair shops
Can you please extend your services to bharuch(gujarat) as well
One of the worst experience i face. They never live up to the expectations and worse are not even apologetic about their actions. They cancel my appointments 2 times for cleaning. they thmselves rescheduled it and again cancel it that too without calling me I had to enquire again n again only thn bother to respond that my appointment is cancel it took 4 days if cancelling and rescheduling that too during festival times . And do not even refunded me immediately. This company is a fraud
Had the worst experience with UC. Booked carpenter to install mortise lock and in a week noticed that the door is cracked from the point where lock was installed. UC refuses to take responsibility and now I have to replace the entire door. UC insurance is nugatory. I paid for installing the lock, now I have to pay for a new door as well. I would never recommend anyone to use the app which has untrained staff and a company who hightails from responsibility after claiming to provide you coverage.
Good
Costly and no quality, I booked for complete house deep cleaning charges me 2.5k plus but what I understood is better hire a person with 900 for whole day can clean better. Even booked toilet deep cleaning , guy cleaned partially and asked to book again after a week so bathroom will be clean. One kind of cheating. I raised complaint on him and Urban sent the same person again to do properly but u know how the mindset of that guy will be. Came and done for name sake by showing his irritation
Saddam did a marvellous job for my stroke affected 79 year old Dad at home. Efficient, professional and polite. thank you Urban Clap
When There is a free styling always it comes that no professionals available after paying 550 is this the service they provide? Very bad
excellent service
I have booked for two service at a time but there is no option for redeem the 2nd. service in the app.
Works very well with home repairs, home cleaning - needs to improve in appliance repair.
well behaved. cleaned properly. some little hard stains on gas stove remain, but i think it is hard to remove. overall good experience
Urbanclap is losing. Very poor service. These guys were very unhappy and the service getting really poor nowadays.
Very satisfied
nice
Worst Company, worst technician,I have booked a slot for TV repair, it is assigned to one technician but he didn't come for visit and some other guy came, i don't know he didn't even know about TV, he simply told we need to carry TV to medavakkam lab to test, no response for 3 days,when I called after 3 days it is under process and very next day he told issue is with panel,i told I don'twant to go with panel change please returnTV to myhome with same condition but he told TV is completelydamaged
every time, not assigned professional
Very worst way of servicing dont use this app itself and professionals are not well after assigning the job they will not come
Pathetic service. Misleading information.
excellent
Hassle free booking. And thoroughly professional.
They cancel bookings and dont even bother to intimate. The help centre/customer care disconnects call before a single ring and send we failed to contact you. Dont choose UC
Service in vizag is very bad. Raised complaint are not attended.
Booked slot for cleaning frigde..no professional is aasigned yet nd not call back
They send unprofessional hair dresser...and after complaining also they don't resolve the issue properly
It's a urban cheating company. Post service, escalation team agreed that it was a mistake of their technician but still only solution they provide is SORRY and no refund for overcharged invoice.
#Untrained professionals In Oct 21, I requested a yearly service for my geyser before which it was working very well. The techician from the Urban Company was inexperienced and he damaged the geyser electonic component while servicing. I made multiple complaints for this as the geyser was not working and they finally repaired it in Nov 21 and the app showed that the service has warranty till Dec 21 but after 20 days again the geyser stopped working and the company did not provide a solution.
Worst. We booked a home cleaning service for an empty apartment, and waited outside our place with all our furniture out. There was no response from them even after the time crossed. Hate them. So not committed and can never depend on their service. The issue isn't addressed. You guys just called back, canceled the service easily and initiated a refund. That is not a resolution. Your service lacks commitment and trust.
Very convenient for daily works.
Unprofessionalism as high as it could getm don't reply here UC - GO check comments and recordings to my complaint before you revert.
it was very nice first time was worth it
Good app but giving 4 star because one of a common service is not available in a popular location and it would be good if you add it.
Too good to have UC services at our comfort zone. Very professional saloon experience who would regret such affordable prices?
This app give service good .... But they are taken two time payment online and offline for the same service... They are make me fool... And they say we will give you refund in 5-7 days working days.... This conversation take 1 months time already... Still I'm not recieve my refund... üò°üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨

The worst services. Professionals lie outright, help center is not reachable. You get call back after hours and days
Everything is fair and no headache of bargaining üëç
2 step pest control is not completed till after 12 days , pls complete your job. Gel treatment is still pending. Pls confirm & send your representative today immediately
very good
Placed my requirement, person came took money said will come next day and never showed up..if there was a way to mark this negative I would have..anyways uninstalling
Nice
The app begged me to purchase premium membership. As soon as i do so the app now does not allow me to book any professionals and keeps showing me errors. Its been months but have not been able to sucessfully book a single appointment. Same with the web portal. Says no professionals available when i am in the middle of Pune. Update: today i trued to book a plumber again and it says no plumbers available in your area. When i tried from another profile, it allows me to. Problem still exists.
Bad bad bad domt use it.
nice üëç
Unreliable services. Today with 4 hours delay and no support. Shameful.
Reliable company
Service is not satisfactory
The warranty claim booking against appliance protection plan is not possible from app.
Very high charges then salon. Professional are not worth..very unprofessional behaviour. No words to describe. I would like to give minus rating.
waste
Worst experience with urban company. Their policy is 3 days before customer should call back if not then they don't care. I will never do any business with this unprofessional people, they don't care whether the work carried out as per their policy of deep cleaning.
Its services are nice but wouldn't consider making them do my house renovation and the parlour staff etc are awesome
When i was writing address its is saying we dont serve in this area yet
Very bad service
We have booked for premium service for 3 bhi which says it is a deep cleaning service however they have charged 1600 more In cash for normal cleaning. And they have charged money for sofa cleaning which we dont have sofa. Better change the name to urban looting service or urban cheating service Worst experience and worst service. We are forced to pay 40‚ÑÖmore than the online price which you have quoted intially. Don't install it guys. Please look for any alternate service nearby
Excellent service
So far completely satisfied with the overall experience
Very very bad
Urban clap takes booking and money in advance,do not fulfil commitment, no contact details to reach, keep customer waiting for 3-4 hours and rhenium cancels even after confirmation The service provider is not upto.mark in kolkata, at least one who is assigned, never turned up
Urban company platform is great, sometime if professional are not good you have problems that is also rare
Great app
Lovely experience
Use
Please don't go for Urban Compamy it's a fraud company they will cheat u
Ask your employees vaccinated. The one who came for bathroom is not vaccinated.
Shame on you, Urban Company for suing your own female employees for daring to ask for better working conditions and decent salaries. As a woman, I have to stand in solidarity with these brave ladies. I cannot and will not support such a terrible company. Uninstalled.
Gud
Services have deteriorated over time. Their so called professionals cancel just a little ahead of time. Disappointed!!
Totally unprofessional approach. The services booked weren't completed. When I booked a re-visit under warranty, 2 people came without carrying any equipment and asked me to provide broom, mop, etc. Then they left on the pretext of getting the equipment and vanished thereafter. Original package included dry vacuuming of curtains, which wasnt done. The curtains were found dumped in the Kitchen sink. Rooms and Bathrooms left dirty. Wish I could upload photos to showcase the shoddy work.
I booked assemble of ikea (huaga) as per ikea instructions. but when person comes to assemble..wrong item pay rs 200 extra..
very professional work,I am very much satisfied.My maid also came half an hour before the alloted time,which is very good.Hopefully next time also aI am going to book from urban company.
Professional service
Unable to book any slots as everytime I book a slot and try to make a payment, it says slot not available. Why can't I see the slots which are available only? Bad user experience.
satisfied
rates of spares are a bit costly
The experience with UC has been amazing! The professionals are very kind , attentive and patient. UC makes my life so much easier, highly recommended!! Big thumbs up !
Really pathetic after sales service. Using service directly is much better than booking through Urban Company
V bad experience. Even after so many reminders no one visited for cleaning
A very useful app for when you need the various services offered in the comfort of your home. I've been a customer for a few years and I've never been disappointed until now. Cheers!
Good option when you need immediate se services for any work related to your home
Thank you urban you made my life easy
Very poor service...they will provide you very high estimate of spare part and if you do not accept they will charge you visit charges...this is very unfair practice by UC....highly disappointed that I used their services and end up paying service charges with no gain...go for your local mechanic only
Got my money back. Thanks
Professional service
nice, safest and easiest moreover it saves ur time
It's great to use urban clap where you get all services at one place.
There is no mention of contact number of the customer care. not able to connect with the team for any queries or concerns.
Perfect service provider
Bathroom cleaning is very good . I am impressed with the work .
Huge difference between service quality of UC vadodara and IC Mumbai. UC Vadodra needs improvement. Service level is not upti the mark
Contacted for problem with my washing machine. Mr Deep came on line within 2 minutes and directed me how to resolve the issue. The issue was resolved within 10 minutes that too without a visit by service personnel. Great initiative and great work. Keep it up UC.
Refund pending for last 4 months
carpentry and others services prices are too high.Even though I have taken membership, convineance charge and minimum order charge was added..that is not fair on UC.what is the point of membership then?Atleast for member,price should be reduced. I would suggest if you have any known Carpenter, plumber or electrician nearby, it is better to get the job done by them at nominal cost, never go for urban company for minor work!
very good work and very clean performance
Not good
Cleaned toilets very much satisfactory .
I booked a professional for house cleaning purpose. The professional didn't turn out at the time of booking and he arrived the next day creating nucense by talking to all neighbours.
Absolutely unprofessional service.. Horrible customer service.. Will not recommend to anyone
I would have given zero star if possible le. My appt is at 9.30am, therapist no show, no information and customer service is at a lost. Do not acquire their service although their therapists seems highly rated. Feels like a scam to me.
Very bad service
Superüëå
One of the excellent app in recent days, and work smoothly and really helpful in day to day household needs.
Bad service, they didn't assign the professional even a half hour before the booking time. All my travel preparation went down
Amazing Service üëç
Gud
Unprofessional staff, customer service is not only bad its pathetic. I changed the company and now hassle and stress cleaning. I will not recommend it to anyone
Awesome service üëè
I take service from Ankita and I 'm fully satisfied with her work she is very calm in nature and very professional Highly recommend

DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THEIR PLUS MEMBERSHIP! No refund availed and there is no way you can contact or speak to them regarding any complaints or queries, Not worth it
Poor service, fake committee, no service delivered on time . DISAPPOINTED !!
Urban clap playing cheap triks with respective to their premium services , as they will allow us to book any repair service with out premium pack(urban plus ) PKG.. dear mgmt don't play this type of cheap tricks... With common man's.
nice
Easy to book and use. Technology makes life easier for sure.
reg service charge to member
No contact number is available.on their app. Unprofessional service.
good
All good but not clear company rate card. Other than labour cost 299 why 300 other charges for cleaning when only labour work nothing else
Good experience with UC
good service
Very worst customer concerned application I have seen. My appointment got pushed to other day saying no executive is available and I faced the same issue more than 3 times. There is no way to escalate the issue or speak to a senior executive. Worst experience. Decided to not use this app anymore and advice people not to trust by advertisements. Horrible service Uninstalling.
They depute thoroughly competent personnel. Very professional services.
üëå
good professional service, affordable and quality cleaning service.
Very helpful
nice
Urban Company- the problem with them is they charge exorbitant fees even if they don't solve the problem. Like today an elctrician came who charged me 478 Rs even though the problem was not solved. Said its the fees for coming and trying to solve it. Do we pay for trying??
Highly priced
Very good
I accidentally uninstalled your app on my device. I am not able to install again.
I had booked for changing all the filters in my aqua guard machine. When I booked I was asked to pay Rs.1900 after 45% discount. When technician came, he said that such filters are of local brand and they will last long for only 3 to 6 months and he asked me to pay Rs.3500/- for changing all the filters. Please clarify which one is true. Hence I changed only candle filter and paid Rs.700/- on 27.12.2021. Charges are too high. If this trend continues, the company's reputation will get faded off
excellent work.
Fraud people working in Urban clab ,one of the technician taken 10K for repair and ran away ...be careful while giving your Harden money to them .
Cost effective and Good service provider
Had booked a technician visit and he simply quoted 4.5k for washing machine repair (Didn't even inspect the individual parts of the machine) (He told me to replace the pressure sensor and PCB reprogramming) But the problem was just blockage in the pressure sensor pipe. Got fixed it from local technician for 350‚Çπ. We the users has to be careful with the "engineers' they call... üòÖ And also when I cancelled the service that "Engineer" teaches me about common thinking üòÖ Totally bad experience.
this is the first time I received services from Urban Company,very good service
(never on time, no communication between the team and the service provider, payment issues all the time) Two days ago, the app accepted my booking at 11:00 am. 7 hours later I got a call from the service provider stating that it is Christmas and they will not be able to come. I reported that on the app I got a call from a RUDE lady telling me that she just received a sick leave from the service provider. Never got a call to appologise, never got the service
We booked a service yesterday and today it's just gone all gone and saying play a game or refresh
good
There is no straight way to connect customer support
Good üëç
Very good service at home
The working experience was great. very nice communication skill, next time would love to call this therapist
I had opted for 2 BHK premium service in Bangalore BLF apartment for around 5500 rupees. A guy came on the day and said it is not worth that amount ans the kitchen is big(you could guess how big a Brigade 2 BHK apartment) and he needs 2 more people. So i should upgrade to platinum. They cancelled and went. Lady called after i said i am not satisfied but she said they need more chemicals and thats why i should upgrade and pay 2000rs more.. Such a mess and unprofessional guys...
Good and fast and reliable prize
I love the service of UC but I am rating 1star to bring this to notice about one experience that makes me doesn't feel like using app. So after adding items in card if I want to add more and press back everytime all the items just get removed, there should be a global cart.
Customer support in not good. I asked for call back but didn't turn up.
Good microwave repair service
Company cancelled the booked appointment one hour after the scheduled booking, which I did in advanced saying we don't have executives,wasted my entire day.too costly and no confirmation better prefer other apps
Life time'
Massage therapist left oil stains on walls. Customer service hasn't called back and it has been weeks. Terrible.
Waste waste app it they provide Bathroom and kitchen cleaning in app after bathroom cleaning work was done that they and customer care was saying it only for bathroom only not for kitchen. Customer care is helpless waste company it is
Fraud company... refund nahi dete... contact karne ke liye customer care sarvice nahi he email karne ke baad koi reply nahi karte Boycott urban company Chor company
thanks for an location upgrade üòä
Introduced gold membership so that customers can avail discount and later charge the customer thru other methods like staff welfare etc.. Why should the customers pay for their staff???
Yaar apne service providers ka dhyaan rakh lo thora, hamesaa rote rehte! Kehte saare paise wahi rkh lete
Excellent service
too good
Worst services , recently booked bathroom cleaning services.. I dont reccomend at all.
Very bad app
if you can specify what all will be covered in each option that will be helpful overall service is excellent
Rabia did a very good job. I am satisfied with her work.
Fast and good service from uck
very nicely worked there was a problem in my tv but the technician worked very nicely and the TV is working now.
Horrible experience, no one should book UC for cleaning. They took 2 hours to cancel the booking form scheduled time of starting work. One can not make call. They told, executive will talk to me but after 5 days also no one called me. I have flied from Nagpur to Kolkata to clean my flat but they cancelled the booking 2 hours after start time. They unreliable no one should book them.
good
Spoiled my day in waiting for the professional for whole day. They accepted the booking and no one is assigned. They didn't even informed if they have any issue. Not sure if I get my money back.
Good
excellent
worst customer service. At the last moment cancelling the booking
very good
The customer care professional who assist you with the services are the worst kinds. They do not know how to talk to a customer, would never listen and interupt them while they speak. Also if they do not like the complaint you make they disconnect the call on your face
Fantastic
She is very good, very polite and her service was excellent.
First experience...Really matched or even exceeded expectations. Hope it happens again...that would be true affirmation.
Good app. All are professional. Punctual.
music, aroma, massager was good....,. not shure about oil
No provision to reach to someone who can help you in issues which are important and not listed in the app.
The name should be changed to worst company. I had booked a session one week prior to the date,although this has happened on other occasions too. The entire week, the app said that my session had been booked successfully. Now ON THE DAY OF THE SESSION, AT THE EXACT TIME THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO COME, the urban company staff call me and say that i have not been assigned a professional. They had days but this is how they waste your time. DO NOT USE THIS APP.
charges should be reasonable in some areas
I booked for toilet cleaning which was done good. In the view of that I booked for carpenter work (which is a minor work). It has been rescheduled thrice and it got canceled without my consent. Even I paid at the time of booking (the charge is also priced high). No options to call anybody or chat if has any issues like this. I would say this company and working professional r not up to the mark &unprofessional. Think before booking. Its like if one got luck will good and prompt service else not
urban club is bestüíê
They are not professional at all and they cancel before the due time with no reason accepted. Before they were good but now no at all
UC is really doing best job.
Not able to select slots
very nice
I paid for membership and now whenever I try to book a service, it says no professional available on this date, without even asking for the date. Pathetic service and no response after complaints. Just give me my membership money back.
Totally time waste, kept waiting for the person , and it's a no show. Waste of time and money.
Urban is the best Company in Australia. They treat their cleaners with utmost respect and give the best service
Good service
Services are way far costlier than the local service provider. But quality work
Pls don't support these corporate people. For changing one small socket the will charge 89 plus added service charges and finally they charge 188 rs. For that also if socket is melted means they will charge 270 for changing single socket board. So pls go to nearby electrician and ask them to do these works, for this kind of work they may charge less than 100 rs only.
Customer service very good
Company apne pros ki koi help nai krti koi bhi problem ho company ko customer hi sahi lgta h every time customer right.......
Good job done by all the service providers that I have booked. Convenience has a cost but it's worth it.
POOR SERVICE,HIS REPRESENTATIVE GIVE US 2-3 DIFFERENT DIFFERENT TIME AND END OF THE HE DENY. AND COMPANY SAID ONLY SORRY. NOTHING ELSE. NOT WORTH AT ALL
PERFECT DIAGNOSED
good work
Great service...Amazing exeperiance..
All good
They will call you every hour but the service will not get done
Very unprofessional application don't download. Executive cancel the booking without any information, person didn't picked up the call, the executive lied to me that he is on site by that he asked me for otp and cancelled the booking. This is my second and last bad experience from urban clap. I hope my money will be refunded from this bad application
Phethetic services
Very poor service provider company
It doesn't show half the option
Many friends recommended me to use Urban Clap but the bill details they are not disclosing and charging high. . Got frustrated and bad impression
There is always a scope to improve more.... have good bad both type of experiences... once bathroom fittings was broken by the person who cleaned that... but UC refunded the amount after giving proper proof.... so they are solving issues ...they have some procedures that had to be followed.... beauticians also well behaved... but some are less experienced with their job... everytime the pedicure had not done properly.... facial experiences are good... but threading experiences are mixed...
Not recommended, scheduled for fan repair and the technician didn't show up, scheduled twise but disappointed same result.
Why do you ask customer to be rated ?
Nowadays uc gives very worst professional service.
Excellent
Service is okay. But unhappy about not getting any intimation or reminder of the UC credits in the wallet, it just gets credited and expires on their own terms without even notifying the customers to use it. Looks like some marketing gimmicks, which clearly is leaving the customers dissatisfied than happy!
I don't even want to give one star. They deserve only 0 out of 5. I booked 6 times and all 6 times no one came to do the salon for me. Worst ever. I will sue this company once more they cancel my booking. I will take them to consumer court.
Before taking body massage is there a choice of doing waxing for men?
Thank you
Must go for it ‚ù§Ô∏è
good
I booked a service for Today. They called there is nobody available in your area. That's all. This company is going down the drain. They should close their Opera.
Good application
Phone pay paid 2 times for the same booking.. phonepay is saying that urban clap needs to refund, but urbanclap didn't initiate any refund till now.
Awesome service
Excellent
Good service
Good effort,.
I went through the reviews below and none of the first 35 reviews I read has granted good rating. I didn't dare to download this app and I don't want to fall a prey to them. I think those who granted one star, must have done so, because they didn't have any option for minus rating. All the reviews almost same and experience is not different from one another. If the overwhelming response is so negative and the voice is unison, shouldn't the company look within and fix the issue.
Services are prompt and excellent üëå üëç
Good services should definitely be applauded and that's the reason I am taking out time from my super busy schedule to write this review for UC. They're providing a great service. They've a good n dedicated customer support, who make sure to help. I've the membership and I am enjoying all the discounted benefits at the comfort of my home. What else would a working mom ask for! I've had one or two bad experiences but the customer care of UC took a great care of my complaint. My best wishes to UC!
Third class app kishi ki koi Value ni jantey urban buss pasee kamana hai Enko Koi plz dusra app nikalo or Esko Niche Girao main ye cahta hu.. Kaam karne vale Worker ki koi Okat ni samjte ye urban vale.. Jaldi koi apna brand banye esko hatao.. Thnku
I m really disappointed by the product they use for facial me and my sister in law both get rashes and pimple on whole face which is disaster and it came after three weeks but as per their policy they dnt want to do giv us their free treatment even we are very valued and loyal customer since two years .....Ladies be careful for facial donot do from urban clap they will not be held responsible they will just provide you one coupon of free online consultation which is nothing in front of your skin
Horrible app and horrible service! Disappointed...I need a refund on my 1 year membership. They accept booking align slots and then call and say after 2 hours that executives are not available...or executives assigned call and give us time for service randomly! Absolutely worst app and with no accountability from the team! Bad customer service! No way register a complaint or talk to a cx executive to discuss our grievance.
The company revoked my own money from the urban company wallet
They loot customer by putting cancellation charges where the professional cancels the slot . Still customer has to bear those charges no simple way to talk to them and get chrges reverse. I won't suggest this app

GR8
I took the service for sofa cleaning the partner was very professional, was in time, explained the entire process well, also while leaving ensured to clean the area properly . keep the good work on . satisfied with service will regularly use the service
I am unable to see salon luxe in the menu option. Please help
very good service
worst creatures calling themselves business platforms
Worst services! Had to go somewhere and as they say professional is assigned an hour before, no one was assigned and because of this my whole day is wasted! Very unprofessional, worst experience!
Very easy and good service üëç
Pure perfection. Be sure to tell them clearly what needs to be cleaned and they'll make it spot less. impressive work.
Sanitized all items in front of me, used an disposable cover, wore a second mask, cleaned and disposed properly the area used, keep it up
good service
Services are good. try to reduce prices.
i always use uc for any repairs or service
Pathetic service
Convenient, friendly and reliable service..
Have tried salon services, carpenter, electrician, home cleaning... Most of the professionals did an excellent job. The only reason I'm giving a 4 star is that my AC was not fixed even after multiple visits. Though they did offer me a refund as it was under UC warranty There is no option to contact anyone from Urban Company which is really annoying. The app does not give option for wall fan cleaning only ceiling fan. Can I not get wall fan cleaning?
Pay your workers instead of taking them to court!
exceptional service
Excellent.
UrbanCompany is turning into urban loot. I had 6 nails on the wall to hang 2-3 photos by a carpenter and guess how much I ended up paying? 600 friggin rupees!!! Loot max.
great service,very much professional
This Company is a sham Customer queries are never addressed by them
They fixed problem raised
Loved it
Good online option for timely help with appliances and hair cut services. Must have during lockdown and other restrictions. Also when product companies are not responding.
Most of the services not available in Ulwe area. Waste of membership money which is not refundable. I daily try to book for sofa cleaning, hair cut kid, bathroom cleaning services but professional not available. If you guys not giving services to specific location why accept membership payment. Not good at all.
Too expensive.
I have just downloaded the app and booked the service. The professionals send a message on the app and keep canceling the service. Absolutely unprofessional behavior and a very bad experience. Also customer support says they will call but never call and drop a message saying we have called you. Even if you receive a call they hang up the line in one second without talking
Good
Good
Only showing in advertising. Poor response and service
Very worst app I book a service and pay online for service but they charge again me, I was show my payment done but service provider girl always saying ma'am payment not done, so please use urban campany service very carefully they are cheet our customers
In starting they given good services but for old customer they not giving proper facilities.. now they not providing services as per slot n bookings..resheduled by own decision n if any running offer they says beautician not available.. now feel worst service
Aisha was the name of my cleaner she did the superb job.highly recommend her
Urban company has restricted customer options in choosing services like facial and pedicure in classic. Not much options available for facials. Charges are also very high.
AC installation is very costly.. 1500 for basic took 2500 extra for gas filling. Total 4000..
Can't imagine the hassles if the app wasn't there.
super and quality work done. if you want excellent sir with genuine price... you can blindly choos Urban Company Services ..
Nice
Amazed with the service too good in everything .
Today I availed services for installing IKEA cabinet and installing IKEA washbasin and wasted 1200 rupees. The carpenter time was scheduled at 3.30pm but he came at 5pm. He lies several times about his location and didn't pick the call few times. He didn't install the cabinet properly and said plumber will take care. The plumber was not at all aware of IKEA products instalation and cut the pipes randomly and finally said he can't install it and left the place with out installing anything.
Professionals cancel the appointment last min and another not assigned Very unpredictable
Their service has become really bad over time. Cleaners always turn up late or don't turn up either. They don't inform you until you run after them to follow up.
Done chimney cleaning take service 1st time from urban clap too much satisfied
very professional, easy to use and really affordable prices!
Best platform in this pendamic
I usually don't write reviews . But this time I have to . I had to repair my fridge and I booked a date in urban company . They said they will come and fix the issue .. it has been 3 days now and whenever I call the person (mechanic) he says he will come but he did not showed up . I called him day before yesterday he said he will come today .. again I called him he said he will come by evening .. again I called him he said he will come tomorrow morning .. I have least expectations now..
Awesome
very osm i got so relax
Professional service
Urban company please treat your beauticians with respect and dignity, and certainly don't file cases for imposing unfair terms on them. Have some shame!
Frustrated. Kept waiting. No service
Higher charges..
No responses received properly... For issues we have.. no option to chat with someone... The call backs from them are untimely... Your professionals don't complete job and mark it complete... And you guys fail to address the issue and refund money
love it
Im surprised how the overall rating for this app is above 4. The only reason i gave a single star is because There is no other option to describe how useless this app is. if anyone needs any kind of Services just google it there are people near by us who are providing better services.
Pay your workers
If you don't have professional for your listed service then remove that service option, I won't recommend your service to anyone.
I called for service today, person arrived in time, spent time patiently in cleaning and making things good for us. Very professional and punctual.
best experience
Keep it up !
Horrible experience... Though there service is ok ok... But there refund process is very disturbing and annoyingüò°üò°... In this digital and quick life..they took very long to Initiates refund.s .... Plz guys go for pay later option.. I'm using so many apps n online shopping... But dealing with there accounts department is my worst experience so far
good
Pathetic service- I was informed last minute that there are no beauticians available and the manager assigned did not give proper explanation and hung up my call. If this is the way you are going to treat customers, please don't be in the service industry
amazing
Twice they rescheduled my request without my consent and finally cancelled it..Never book services from them if you want it urgently. worst experience
My beauty service was excellent and UC made my day by sending one of their best beautician. Hope u'll maintain this quality always üëå Strongly recommended
Good
They exploit their workers and have filed a suit against women workers who wanted to use the washroom at their central office. Don't use this horrible app run by unethical people
I took platinum service for house cleaning. They didn't do well. We would have done with our maid within 1000 rs but I have paid 7600 for empty house cleaning and spolied our newly painted wall. I have expected professional Cleaning but not even at basic level
Neha home deep cleaning service those labour is the very bad behaviour ( Arjun) they spit on wash basin and they don't have manners how to talk with coustoumer and i listened manager cheatan they don't give those labour salary and Chetan talking with my dad very rudely and showing attitude i Don't like this company
intense cleaning of toilet done well. Happy & Satisfied
Excellent timely service by UC team... the faulty refrigerator is working fine. Glad with the professional service.
all ok
Chip urban clap
Useless app. Thief
Staff are Experts in the job and highly professional. Did a neat job and left the place spick and span
Good
Excellent service by UC professional
service wise good 5* but I don't find any opinion to contact UC 1*. So please do provide customer care service contacts.
Amazing app
excellent
The rule that cart should have a minimum amount to checkout is ridiculous. It's not allowing to checkout with the amount less than 500/-. It's better for the marketing team to change this minimum amount rule.
My 2 worst experience Found coackroach in professional bag again .... And company chqrging 50 rs for maintaing heigeine Service is totally unhygenic as I found 2 cockroach in professionals bag when he started her service and Urban company commits total clean and hygeine
Service providers are always late...
Worst service ever. I booked for 2 services. For the 1st service, the professional came an hour late & did an unsatisfactory work. While they rescheduled twice for the 2nd service which was very inconvenient for me so I kept on trying to connect with the customer care but there was no response from their end. Finally I had to cancel the booking. Please don't use this app, hire local professionals instead, they will do the work for much cheaper rate and better!
Quality work Price High
Why do you keep minimum order cost too high? You will be ultimately at loss.
Perfect and mess free services at a very affordable price. Saves time and money.
Will be back when you treat your workers right and respect collective bargaining. Uninstalled for now.
Good service for sofa dryclean
Absolutely unreliable. You pay & book in advance and just at the time of service you will get a cancel/reschedule notification. Happened multiple times. !!
Treat your employees right and pay them fairly
This is one of the worst services, customer support not working properly they will say that they will call back to sort issue but no one will call and if we try to chat with them it says we have already registered your concern and our team will get back shortly. Also they charge extra... It means price will be different from app to person. Instead of choosing this trust less app better to choose local parlours. Also they mention to mail even though no response will be expected from them.
Just because your women workers are protesting for 2 months against low wages, poor working conditions and high commissions, instead of giving them response or helping then out, you have called protest illegal and sued them. Pathetic App. You're this step is undemocratic and against the constitution because constitution gives them right to protest.
Start showing some respect & taking care of the grievences of the people that work for your organisation. Stop their exploitation.
Patiently waited back and completed entire work... clean work and deligent....
Where clasic new launch facial there is no facial new when stared
Respect your workers
Very nice üëç
Urban company changed my schedule on their own without asking me.I have had many services done by the UC before.But this is totally unacceptable.
Excellent work...
Useless.
I am fascinated by the service! Good job UC keep it up.
Such a worst company !!! The professional didn't arrive and not lifting calls such a worst experience
Very good work culture and cheaper than local plumbers.
#nongenderdiscrimination
This company is straight up unethical and a scam. They delivered our covid tests for 2 of our 6 ppl late not letting us travel. Even worse, their customer service approach is about blaming the consumer for their incompetence. Don't use this company for anything at all. They are scammy and the worst of the worst. I wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy.
Great
#nogenderdiscrimination
Terrible. Treat their workers/contractor's horribly.
Good job
nice one
Worst service and very unprofessional behavior
Already connected with your telephonic team,not recommended to anyone It is totally Fake . For Money making they can do anything. Don't book any appointments for any kind of services or work. There should be no star policy in Play Store. majboori main ek star dena hi padta hai.
The service is good but the charges are unrealistic. I did a simple socket replacement and board repair you charged me with Conveyance Charges + Product Procurement charges (product purchase is different)+ Labour Charges + Fitting Charges extra per product there is tarrif. So for 3 socket replacement and 1 board fitting they charged me 1000 rupees ‚òπÔ∏è
Good
I am a proud and self esteemed transwoman, the experience my fellow community member had to face from UC made as all feel bad for the organization. It's evidently written the company dosen't tolerate discrimination against customer based on gender, sex, religion, race or caste.. But what we faced in reality was all against this. Shame on UC. At first the service provider ran back after coming to the location and informed my friend that she dosen't identified it was a transwoman on call.
Well behaved and decent professional was provided. This level of cleaning cannot be expected from household maids.
Poor attitude by the company suing it's own employees
Pathatic, not transparency in rates , membership works after one visit, not give costumer care no. in app to solve the issue, i don't recomended this app to any one don't take membership, i totally disappointed.
Fantabulous
Keeps cancelling and reshceduling the booking on their own.
Since 2015, have booked services on their app 4-5 times and unfortunately, the experience has always been very poor as they love to cancel the booking rather than resolve. Yesterday, took a video consultation from them on my washing machine issue and was told that they will service it soon. Today morning, was called and told that I should have approached Samsung for the service. If that's the response, not sure what's the idea and vision behind urbancompany's existence. Very unprofessional.
Their Parlor professionals gives all the time some new medical reasons for not visiting on time....This is truly not accepted...if you cannot come on given time, then why do you suggest timeslots...they want to come when they have time, which cannot be managed just on time for working mothers....one time medical reason is understandable but 3rd or 4th time it looks fake.Hence cannot be trusted.Shame on you Urban Clap for giving medical reasons to clients and wasting their time after booking....
Dear UC team. Thank you for the excellent service.
Worst processes!! If I like a beauty professional and want to continue with same professional... they do not show the slots at all. Have to book for new professional everytime!! I do not prefer this!! Happened to me thrice. Will never opt any further !!
very helpful aap
Horrible firm mistreating employees. Treat those who make you, right.
I have paid the full amount and asked for a salon appointment at 430pm today. It is now almost 5pm and no person has been assigned yet. This is absolutely ridiculous. Feel like a scam.
Usually they are prompt in sending person. But had. Bad experience with pedicure booking. Booked for a pedicure, first they pushed it to later time in the day saying they don't have anyone available. Then at later time they said no one available and pushed to next day. Next day also they called and said no one available.
good
Everytime showing slot not available after payment option...
They are trying to harass gig workers and have sued such hard workers. Shame on Urban Company
Excellent Service provided by Anita Gupta.
Great app for needed
My booking time has already passed,and yet no professional has been assigned.No information or call regarding this has be made.
Urban company executives lies when complaints lodged by customer. It says marking as resolved as calls are not connected whereas only a single call didnt connect which is basically a missed call which rang not more than 5secs. Liar UC.
absolutely everything is perfect,,,I'm very happy
The professional they sent was late. He took forever to complete the job. I raised a complaint which was not addressed. End result of the service was not at all like they claim. This may not be a regular occurrence, nonetheless my experience wasn't great. Paying more money than it usually costs should be for a reason.
prompt and perfect service
I am very disturbed I am very disappointed from your professional she left without completing my job her behaviour was not good
Fair pay and worker rights seem to be things that this organisation does not care about Treat your partners better!
superb one
Employees done good work
Before you download this app, read this: Urban Company is suing its workers because the workers are protesting against low wages, poor working conditions, and high commissions. I have uninstalled this app because these underpaid workers are being intimidated through legal threats by Urban Company. Please don't download this app.
Worst experience twice
excellent
Such an idiotic service. I have booked salon fir the first time for my wedding and the lady didn't come at the time of booking. She has cancelled it on the time. And there were not even supporting to reclschedule at the earliest only next day slots they were offering. It is so frustrating. I regret choosing this service
Shame on you for exploiting workers and trying to suppress collective bargaining.
Good service at home. what else we want. on time service.
Hassle free work.
Issue was resolved in no time. That's customer delight at its best !!
Rating urban clap due thier bogus policy which is indirectly harassing their partners(maids, hair cut) etc..
had two bad experiences with this app. not about to have a third.
Pathetic. Clean up your act.
The app is not functioning. Cannot log in or do anything else.
The company is highly ethical in its ways and it is honestly quite disappointing to witness the extent to which it exploits its partners. I don't think I'll be installing this app again.
Wrost service professional denied at moment no back up plans
Recently came to know they're suing their service partners for protesting against unscruplous policies. It's obvious that they are driven by nothing but corporate greed who dont want to listen to the very partners who do the actual work for them. Wont be using any of their services till they see the fault in their actions.
Uninstalled UC due to their inhuman approach to their partners who is protecting for their right.
Highly exhorbitant price..strongly avoid
If you can't handle your employees well, you can never handle a customer well. This shows your mindset.
In solidarity with the gig workers.
Booking was accepted but no beautician assigned. I was informed this at last moment. Really disappointed with the services. Will not recommend.
awesome. company .
Horrible practices towards its contract workers and they are now sued for protesting their low wages.
Pay your workers minimum wage
No respect for time. Beauticians dont bother to pick or call and also they cancel or delay in the last minute. Twice i booked both the time same stuff. Absolutely dissapointed by your behaviour.
Please respect your executives and do what's good for them. You cannot exploit people on whose backs you stand upon.
Disappointed to hear about the experience of the women workers. Hope, UC will host meetings to resolve the internal conflicts soon and not pressurize the dwindling workforce of women into exiting altogether. They've worked with you despite the pandemic, reward them instead of penalizing them. A horrifying case study to read about in 2021.
Day 1:: 02/12/21 Raised a request. Day 2:: 03/12/21 Executive responded finally yesterday evening. Day 4 : Executive called 3rd december and promised to reassign the cook but no response Day 6:; 2 executives contacted on Dec 4 and 5 for reassigning the cook. But till now no response. Day 10: Asked executive to cancel and initiate refund for remaining..but as usual again they are super fast..no response again.. Day 21: They initiated refund 2weeks before but still got nothing. As usual great care
Rating changed to 1. The yearly membership is a hoax. They only give you a 4 times discount max irrespective of the months you have subscribed for. There is no conditions apply mark when they sell the subscription and you'd only get to know if you go further down to FAQs. Pathetic!
Unfair labour practice ans suing ther own employees ...worst company of all time
Great platform for booking services.
Third class company.
Terrible service n bad behaviour with its partners... Not acceptable
Very horrible application. The worst customer care. Never use clean services. They will cheat you badly.
uc team is very professional and their work.
For unethical treatment of their female workers! Shame on you!
Never forget your roots the company that was build on good service with customers and workers are now filling law suit on women for protesting outside your building.
For suing you female workers!
Boycott Urban Company because they exploit their women workers! In solidarity with the protestors. This is a sexist, abusive company. Boycott.
So, so as it's charges r very high
prompt, convenient and customer friendly
They really need to provide better services and treat their staff better.
Stop Exploitation of workers
Lousy company which treats its workers lousily. Ashamed to have ever used their app.
Work for your partners first, address their demands.
Most bogus company, do not spoil your hard earned money, my work doesn't completed but they're showing done. Think twice before trust.
Excellent service. all the best
Withdraw the case
Good
Not assigining prefered personal and charging cancellation fees .This is not acceptable
Stop suing employees for asking basic rights
very good. completed as expected. time saving and no dragging up the work.satisfied.
How about you withdraw the cases POS
For unethically treating its workers and filing a case against protestors instead of listening to their reasonable demands.
Uninstalled the app because these leeches have failed to ensure basic rights for their workers. We cannot participate in blatant exploitation in the name of convenience.
A one stop shop for all the house helps and fixtures
This is for you guys filing a case on women workers on your app instead of addressing their concerns.
It's appalling to hear that UC has sued all those women who are demanding change in policies.
I want urban clap. to change the facial tissues as the beautician ad urban clap never had the soft tissue stock revoomnedong soft cloth tissues fr facial n also include lotus n natures products as vlcc does mt suit all skin types
very professional...will strongly recommend and repeat the service for sure
Uninstalling this app due to poor treatment of their partners who do the actual work.
Pay your gig workers their fair wages!!
There is no immediate customer care support and costly service.
Good job along with adherence to COVID protocol. Reasonable charges
Hey! Please stop harassing your workers. I prefer using the services of companies that treat their workers well. So goodbye! Uninstalled.
Very cheap service. Behaviour is very bad.
Terrible employee policies. Exploitative and inhuman.
Excellent experience with their person Gangaram.
Respect your gig workers. We stand in solidarity.
You are a big company taking away rights of your gig worker women, I used to be your customer but never again until you act like an ethical company you claim to be
It is horrendous what this company is doing to its female partners. Filing frivolous judicial proceedings to scare them from demanding their rights. They are abusing their workforce and coercing people into disadvantaged contracts. Never gonna use the app again.
Gud professionals, they have done cleaning work properly
Waste of time and money
Worst experience from Urban company, they even don't have proper technicians, they don't know how to open washing machine board itself, I request no one to use urban company
I am first booking bathroom cleaning,on 22/12/21 12-30p.m and paid Rs.448/- but last minet canceled my waiting weast time app. Amt credit after three hours.
Great Service
Horrible service. The service guy who came for fixing is demanding extra money.i don't have an option to complaint. Horrible
I have taken the services of UC.The best part which I like is the punctuality of their professionals.
Very good and professional
Horrendous. Disgusting classisy move on your part UC. damn disappointed.
Suing women workers who are simply asking for their rights, never using this service again. You're nothing without your employees
good
uninstalling it , found out that they've suing their women gig workers for protesting against unfair work conditions , terrible management
excellent n worth more than the payment
Full solidarity with the women gig workers protesting unfair work conditions at Urban Company.
Frod company
Please don't give any business to Urban Company unless they treat their partners better!
Their business practices are inhuman.
Support your women workers and stop sueing them for asking bare minimum
Excellent service. Keep it up.
Your services have been pathetic. 1. Two young bunch of guys came to work with just one vaccume cleaner and one of them just left within 10 mins of arrival. 2. Estimated time given to us was 2-3 hours. It took almost 6+ hrs to complete the task 3. Vaccume wasn't powerful enough to pump out anything from the sliding or from tuff corners 4. Floor cleaning and sliding cleaning were done with normal soap water. No machine used or no solution or anything differently done than that what my maid does
very prompt service
Awesome service!!!!
Pathetic how they're suing their own workers for demanding basic things. Inhuman company
good job
Unethical company. Trying to make money of hardworking staff who all fall under lower income group.
There's zero customer support post sale. Do not take the Chef services from Urban clap. Just causing harassment
excellent
Cannot do business with a company that goes after its workers for protesting. Unconscionable!
Very good
Had only recently started using the app and found it useful but having seen how they are legally persecuting the women who have gone on strike demanding better working conditions, I have decided I would rather not use an app that treats its workers or any human being this way. Uninstalling in solidarity with the women until Urban Company withdraws the case against them.
The worst service app ever. They took 3 days to find a professional for me and still said that we are unable to find you a professional for your service. I was notified about that only 20min before the service was supposed supposed take place. I have never in my life experienced such a bad experience from a service based company. They wasted my time, energy, money . Won't recommend it to anyone .
This app exploits the very gig workers that make it a success. Shame on the UC leadership. Uninstalling it.
Only fair that your customers treat Urban Company the way it treats it's gig workers
There no way to connect to the customer support??.. being a service provider, cannot believe they don't have a customer support contact number....anyway , decided not to take the service, booked with another one and uninstalled the app..
Excellent service
You book a service and no one comes. They call you 1 hour post your booking time to say sorry !! Pathetic services.
The Professionals doesn't come at assigned timings... they call and ask us whether they can come in other timings which are convenient to them.. If that's the case why the slots are given, for convience of the customer only right ? And when we deny and ask them to come on the same time.. they won't come and say that we called u, u didn't answer the call, whereas I didn't receive a call from them
üëåüëèüëç
Very very very disappointed with lack of customer service..I am continuing complaint since August.But every time it is said that your money will come in 2 days...but no....
good service.prompt time.
Excellent service
üëç
Very useful for many household services that too with warranty periods. Kinda life saver.
I referred it to my brother and he didn't get get 100rs off coupon. Fraud app. Customer care support is also not there.
I've used it a few times other than two times , my service keeps getting rescheduled for the next day every time at the last moment when you can't arrange for an alternative .Even the tean is not considerate of the customer , they just call and apologise after the booking time has lapsed . Don't accept the booking if you can't honor it . When you charge a cancellation fee , make it so thta you pay the customer for cancelling on them the last moment
They don't give their service in tire 2 or tire 3 city. That's not good it's disappoint me. üëé
Good service of water purifier very unqiue service very very good service I'm so happy
Timeline very good maintain
Very Bad
service was too good
Why are suing your own workers for asking for the bare minimum to be able to continue as your workers?? You profit and they what? Continue to suffer?
great service
Scumbag company trying to sue their own workers.
Absolutely unprofessional
They reschedule your without calling you before 30 min of your service timings.
I have been trying to book salon classic from almost three days. No response or the app is horrible. Has no option to choose date and check availability. Received a note you will be notified when the slots are available. Not a single message or the package which i selected does not even show any where in profile. Too complicated and unfinished App. Horrible customer service. I wil not use or recommend anyone.
Good for most of the services from home cleaning to beauty salon, perfect services and trained professionals. Just pest control service was somewhat unsatisfactory. One star less for that.
Unable to book salon classic have been trying to book it since yesterday,salon prime is available for booking,it feels like we are forced to buy products we dont want,fix the issue or else u loose a loyal customer
Not providing bridal makeup when I need it the it most urgentlt
Horrible company, uninstalling app! Treat your workers right by accepting their demands instead of filing lawsuits against them when they protest against your company's terrible pay and working conditions. No customer will be happy unless the workers are happy. Solidarity with protesting workers.
Urban Company doesn't pay its workers fairly, refuses to acknowledge that they are workers, and is now trying to break a strike for fair conditions by threatening legal action. Horrific.
Almost from last 2 years we are using this app but this time we have faced so much prblem that's why I am changing im my review from 5 Star to 1 Star very much disappnted. I have bookd the service of bathroom cleang and 2 fans cleaning we have bookd the service on 21th for 22th 9am professional calld me 21th evening and askd me 2 cancel now it's showing my service as been scheduled to 22th evening at 7.30pm which have not requested. The time is came now the urban compay will lose he's business.
Horrible service, rather than providing and curing the product, they have rather destroyed our product. Highly disappointing to come accross such service provider in this era of competitive market, idk if the company is unaware about the power of an unsatisfied customer
I have downloaded this app today but had a very bad experience. For Haircut + Hair colour(only application) charges was Rs 249 and including convinience fee its was Rs 298. Later i was asked to Pay Rs 199 more for Hair colour application or i was told to drop the Hair colour application if i dont pay Rs 199. It was not about paying Rs 199 but was about asking more money then what was there on the app. I will never use this app and will recommend my family and friends the same.
Calling the courts on your own gig workers. What a shame. No respect.
Terrible service; they should clean up their own business before trying to clean houses.
Services provided are way too expensive..one reason I can see is the app itself is charging a lot and eventually the services are getting expensive. Think about the consumers as well as the people providing services.
App is not user friendly Have been trying to book a service but it's showing error every time. No page for FAQs or customer contact
Inhumane
Plumbers hasn't no idea about simple work.
Good
Treating your gig workers like they are nothing. This is wrong path you guys have taken and I personally cannot use this application knowing the situation.
The workers are professional so listen to their demands.
If you can't respect your workers and their rights, the ones who are toiling for the services, you don't deserve to have any support.
The worst service app I had a booking for hair they took more than 15 days they keep rescheduling and rescheduling the service date and they even don't update about the service appointment and the service was worst don't book from urban company go to your personal salon don't even think to try.
Super service for all your needs!
Very bad service for washing machine ,urban company don't have professionals
Services is not good. Even no option to make complaint.
I haven't got any bad experience.. it would be great if urban company starts giving services to smaller town.
great experience
Never use to his app their professionals are highly unsafe and they charge you for no reason. Today I had booked carpentry and for some reason I had to reschedule it to a couple of hours later. Despite that he arrived and entered my house and starting blaming that I am disrupting his daily income and stuff and to my surprise I see him secretly taking a video of me and smiling shadily. I instantly grabbed his phone to check and saw he had been recording for a long time. Highly unsafe never again
i am very disposed to your sarvice. Three times cancellation the oder.
very good service
Very good experience,
pleas take Mehndi design ladies also
It's excellent and hassle-free service providers company
The app is best
Bookings are cancelled / rescheduled in the last minute
Good website for services.
very good in service ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
after long time I am satisfied with urban company
excellent service cordial person
Bet
I booked for a cleaning service which wasn't done properly requested for a revisit by a different person which they could not approve and said will refund the amount which I'm nt happy with . I wanted another professional to get it cleaned but no satisfactory response. I always recommended for this app to my family fir cleaning services but now I'm disappointed that you guys could not help
I have been dedicatedly using UC since past 5-6yrs for all their services, however lately their service is going down from bad to worst. I will not recommend UC anymore for any of the services. What started as the best services is now struggling for survival.
Horrible experience no body is there to solve the issue
goog
great service always! initially I hesitated to book any service through UC but now I see it as a first option if I need anything to be fixed
I booked deep cleaning. They rescheduled for 3 times and finally cancelled. The Service person is not confident to do the jobs, even to try. They are concerned about their ratings. It seems they clean only the places which are already in good condition. I will not opt for any service from them.
good
Changed my rating from 5 to 2. I'm not able to book the services that I require. Such a major hassle. An app which is causing inconvenience instead of convenience is absolutely useless.
Not good service
They have charged different amounts for same package and money got deducted
The services have improved since 1 year
Very poor....Very bad service. unprofessional.
good
Customer support of this company is pathetic. They just tell you that they will call you at so and so time but they keep on extending it. Then you receive a message that they are unable to connect with you they will try again tomorrow. Seriously pathetic support. And never take the membership if you take it they will take you for granted.
Poor service and high charges
Person was very courteous and helpful, very satisfied, keep up the good work
Unprofessional and unreliable!
urban clap good
UC was one stop place for all home services but recently I noticed a pattern and that everything isn't ethical about it anymore. I booked a geyser installation for 3L geyser, tech came drilled one screw in wall, left geyser pipe leaking and also disconnected RO pipe, charged 850 for those 10mins and suggested me to call RO service (though politely) from urban company,the RO guy actually fixed geyser installation, charged another 477, total cost 1327 for 3L geyser, where as brand charge 300.
Good job
I have issue with cash back,where can I complain this issue.There is no customer support
Very bad about urban clab there are not refunding full money there are dedecting 300 rupees from it and also not responsing and made a payment of 1920 but there are refunding only 1623
Very poor Service
Bad product using
Good service provider
My recent booking on urban company was smooth and customer service was also excellent. Definitely recommend UC for salon services in Trivandrum.
Very unprofessional employe especially Poonam rawat , she accepted my Booking request and didy came even didn't informed me onces about any inconveniences . Poor service when I complaint about her my pay after delivery and cash on delivery services are cancelled by the company. Did not recommended any one full of time waste and nothing else.
Awful experience UC person sprayed water on the geyser. Not sure why inefficient people are hired. Very disappointing experience. Uninstalling the app.
Very helpful app.
Wouaho amazing service, very clean , very respectful . can't wait to book again. I'm so happy for the serviceüíÉüíÉüíÉüíÉüíÉ
A little overpriced compared to market parlor rates.Members seem to get only expensive offers in the name of discount.Customer deserves the right the choose frm all kinds of products according to choice and affordability.However 3 stars for service,professionalism and cleanliness.
I took the service of destress massage and it was so relaxing and excellent, Sangita Tandel was my therapist and I recommend her for body spa and massage ,as she is skilled and well organised. üëçüëç
very delighted to have a women's hairsaloon service at home. wonderful experience.
Why not customer care number mention if someone dont know how to use this app? Im gonna uninstall this nonsense app.
nice and really good
Nice service given
Great Experience
Very good service. Highly recommend
Waste of money. Service is not up to the mark. kindly confirm everything on call before making payment. They fool you and the person who provides the service doesn't do much justice to the work.
It was really a worst experience for the first time. I booked a service in urban company beauty. 4days before only I booked. But at last moment they rescheduled it to next day morning. I thought they would come next day without any fail. But again they kept me waiting and at last moment when I called them they mentioned no professionals were available and they will schedule it for next day. Patiently I waited for 3 times for the rescheduled slots. At last they asked me to cancel the booking.
This company is fraud
Good
They don't have a customer support and help. Just FAQ. No contact number.
Pathetic service..!! Seriously not recommended
ok
service on time and perfect
Best services !!!
Very very bad service. We have booked for bathroom and kitchen cleaning. And one person (N Muni Sekhar Reddy) came to our house for this job. He just checked bath rooms and said that, he will bring another person and went out. After some time he set the booking status as 'Completed' with out doing any work. He is not responding to calls. We have raised a complaint in the UC app,but they have not yet responded. We have wasted our money and time because of this stupid APP. This is a fake APP.
good
Absolutely pathetic service. Professional does not come up at the designated time and the booking is rescheduled to another time according to there convenience without informing me.
Very bad service. I had booked a prepaid service a week ago but person was not assigned. Also customer care didn't even bother to update anything about it. Worst service provider who can't provide updates in time and assign professional for pre-booked services.
Good professional cleaning
No way to get in touch with customer care. My executive took an electrical appliance to be replaced under warranty, said he'll be back with the replacement within 3 days. It's been a month and he's been avoiding calls and promising to come immediately and never turns up.
I would not like to give even a star for the unprofessional behaviour from the customer care executives, technichians, escalation team Highly unprofessional people with the aim of looting and cheating the customer and highly highly rude behaviour of the customer care executives Highly not recommended app!! Very disappointed
I booked Urban company for cleaning my house. The company that was assigned to me was called AJ ROCKS. First of all, they rescheduled 2-3 times even though I booked long before. They did a lot of damage to my house, like they left marks on our italian marble tiles due to using some incompatible liquid, they broke our mosquito net, made scratches with scotch brite on the cupboards, they used some liquid on the tv and now we have to change the LCD screen (cost Rs.20000). When we complained they s
syed Sadiq is very good experience 100 percentage satisfied work end very good urban company thanks urban company end thanks syed sadiq
Horrible service
Excellent app. I use urban company app regularly
Non Customer Care Support, need to email and follow up for details
Cleaning good ,pest control bad Infact more cockroaches and inescts started showing up after pest control. Pest control guy was evasive while applying cream and liquid and his response was "yahan nahi lagate, wahan nahi lagate". The cream itself seemed bad more cockroqches and insect appeared after applyin it. Updated on 20 dec----- Had a chat with urban clap(Sohail) and they resolved the issue
Bakwan
Very Very Very worst application ever
Very worst app only for money. Don't go this app choose another one .
Most of the times visiting person from UC not having all the basic required items in the kit ,Hair remover brush having challenges of sanitization.
Hidden scams... From service oriented to greedy profit minded company eg: super saver not applicable to royale..basic is just untrained person..not professional
Nrver ever book a hair stylist from hrre, the hair have become the worst version, they dint refund money and dint let me write review for hair profesdional. Maha gawar ppl working here. Worst and frauds
Easy, affordable salon@home service with amazing branded products.
I had booked an appointment but they didn't assign me professional on time n then they themselves rescheduled it whereas I wanted it on the day I booked and on top of that the professional is asking me that can I plz come at 11.30 instead of 2 .30 According to her time which is ridiculous n then the company again requests me for rescheduling it ... company does not work on customers demands they work on their professional demand..in pregnancy I soo wanted a foot spa n they totally pissed me üò§
Got my flat deep cleaned and found that they did a very thorough job . The personal were very polished and polite.Thanks to their team for the excellent job.
Professional Work
Exorbitantly charged (and additional charges like convenience / safety charges etc. are levied at the time of booking). They even removed basic deep cleaning option for home. Only premium / platinum options for deep cleaning are made available that are of high charges. Worst part is NO CUSTOMER CARE number provided for us to call them for any booking details.
Shitties company ever to get service from. They will only believe their executives and not the customer. The best part is that you have to prove that you have paid cash to their executives. Anyone reading this make sure you do a video of paying cash. Apparently that is required as proof.Had a bad experience where the cleaning guys have damaged my bathroom..
Archana Mandal is very humble and well behaved.very much satisfied with her service.
gr8 for water purifier
it was awesome experience.
Very easy to call and excellent sevice
easy to book, staff are helpful
Worst experience‚Ä¶ booked for the repair of geyser and it was stated earlier that there is issue in electric supply‚Ä¶ Extra payment was charged stating that switch was changed despite the fact that switch was provided by me only‚Ä¶ never trust
excellent
They don't give the service they promised
Good
excellent work
worst services, just for showcase only.
Nice and friendly technician üëçüëçüëç
there was no ratings below it..no one comes.
Very good apps
Bad
Booking was for 4pm. Cancelled by the provider. No no slots till Tuesday. Paid in advance and took some stupid membership which I have no clue on how to refund.
After taking membership.. evertime they took booking.. but nobody comes for the service... they are cheater..... fraud.... no support from the company... always slot not available...... third class service
Really made life much easier
Great service provider
Good
Very good and convenient app. But now they are charging additional convenience fees for training of their professional. Customer support needs to be improved.
Very helpful for day to day work.
Pathetic and worst. First the person cancelled as he was not having the equipment to clean. Secondly the customer executive mentioned that Urban Clap has no or limited service with machine cleaning. Thirdly, if Urban Clap is incapable of providing timely and accurate service as per description, they should stop fooling customer by giving a wrong service description. Wasted my time and energy. Urban clap says penalty in case of cancellation within 2 hours, what about company if cancelled at last?
Fastest service
super staff..genuine..friendly..patient..they give 100% or more..
good
Minimum order fee! Defeats the purpose of calling folks for repairs. Urban company is just money looters. Useless & waste.
Nice service
Very worst experience today on professional service. If they are not able to handle the problem created during service then atleast they should accept the mistake. Absolutely unprofessional. & more and over customer service gives solutions to close the request, get the money back and raise the request again and customer suffers due to the mess created by professional and had to clean himself. Extraordinary way to handle complaints!! I don't want to give any rating but enforceed to give 1 star.
Good
Very bad experience with beauty services...they assigned one beautician .she called me that she is coming n thn she cancelled at the last moment and urban company themselves rescheduled the appointment...so disappointed
Unhappy with the constant rescheduling of confirmed appointments by the company. Has happened twice now in this month itself... The rescheduling was not even informed to me.. My appointment was paid and booked for today 1 pm. However when i checked the UC app 10 minutes to 1 pm i get to know that it has been rescheduled again to date of thier own choice... Do you expect me to take a holiday on a working day for the appointment sake??? This is very disappointing.
Very useful app
Overpriced, cancellation charges, issues not being resolved. Not a good company. Time for a new competitor to fill up the space.
Has started charging exorbitant prices based on their brand image. Their bathroom cleaning service is not value for money. Only those people should take their services who are lazy/old to clean their own washrooms.
Very professional in their approach with a team of experts in their respective fields. All are very polite and maintain covid protocols religiously.
very good service
Most desirable electricians!
Worst services. Don't believe
Minimum order should not be a criteria
Within one month- had 3 cancellation by company, as they were late for 1 hour.... no one calls in time and informs about changes. I have to call every time why cleaner is late or didn't show up. Terrible service.
There is no help center number provided in the application. The booked order doesnot show the proper description of the service ordered.
Good cleaning and repair service.
Worst service.Never trust them for any service.They booked my slot and didn't turned up.Even after raising issues with them they dint even bothered to help.Would never recommend this if you have any urgent meets.
Very worst site don't book from this site every time they are asking for rescheduling and cancelling very very worst site
Again and again it keeps logging out saying something went wrong, even when there is internet connection and I am able to open other apps at the time. Every time I want to use this app, I have to uninstall and install again!
Thisss app is really good üëç‚ù§
Lutara
nice and professionally managed company. have taken pest control and hair cutting services. happy with the same.
Very bad experience They don't assin professional on tym and charge 50 rupees on customers as a cancellation fee.
charge is too High.
Cant see wallet while doing payment, without cart how can we add services and more if we forgot few services. If we come back nothing we see previous added services, Amazing app without cart option how can we manage my items.
Superb experience
The service professional asked me for my phone number and otp and logged into my account using his phone. How do I log out of all devices? Why do you not have a call center for raising complaints?
very good professional service for hair cutting, very clean and neat service
Awesome services. Polite staff and timely response. Used Urbanclaap so far for cleaning and plumbing.
K vigneswaran's service was superb...very humble person..very professional service.. He done a very good job üëç
Unprofessional partners and your customer services is worth, Not acceptable. Will never use your app again. Thanks
Even after booking the Appliance repair technician has not arrived and he made me to wait for the entire day by not going anywhere thinking that he might come at any time and he was not responding. Even UC was least bothered about this and you have debited amount but service was not done at the right time. Why do you debit amount from customer before service is done and you should ask money after the service.Very bad service UC. You should rate yourself below 1 when technician has not come.
Worst experience, they just give false promises but don't deliver the service and make excuses later. No value at all for customers or their time. Callbacks happen only after repeated emails and that too only 2 hours late. No direct number to call them. Customer service isn't even empathetic to the customer or their situation and are just interested in saying sorry and keeping the call. Waiting for my membership to be done and post that I'll uninstall the app. Will use local services from now.
EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE PROVIDERS. THEIR PROFESSIONALS THINK THEY ARE OVER QUALIFIED TO ANSWER CLIENT QUERIES. AS A CERTIFIED CIDESCO PROFESSIONAL I WOULDNT RECOMMEND TO GO WITH ANY PROFESSIONAL THAT UC QUALIFIES. UC ONLY HAS FEW PROFESSIONALS CERTIFIED FROM GOOD INSTITUTIONS. SO BEWARE BEFORE HIRING ANY UNKNOWN PROFESSIONALS. READ ALL FEEDBACKS FROM THEIR EARLIER CUSTOMERS.
Awsoommee

The app is easy to use. However, as a company, UC levies service charges of Rs. 49 fir use of new gloves, masks and sanitizers of its ppl who come to our home, but those professionals have not been getting these things for a few months now. This behaviour is unethical; even the customer is also at risk when the professionals reuse their sanitary items. I chose to pay cash only when the professionals open a new set of gloves and mask in front of me. You can do your bit.
great customer service
good
Extremely disappointed. Everytime i booked a service, the experience was traumatic.
Perfect
Professionals of UC are just perfect to our needs . wish good luck
good quality as usual
Prompt service
I am very happy with the services provided by URBAN CLAP, job of BEAUTICIAN was EXCELLENT Up To The Mark, Arrived on time ,Product she used were also Quality wise, and hope i will be provided same BEAUTICIAN in Future
Professionals do not arrive
Very unprofessional and casual in their approach. The scheduled time was 3pm The 2 people arrived only at 445pm. Instead of 3 to 4 people for the premium package only 2 people arrived. Not sure what will be the outcome or just a simple waste of money. Very disappointed urban company!
Really good app and great for getting timely updates
I cancelled my booking of tank cleaning on 24/11 due to personal reason on the same day I booked I.e 22/11 ,don't know the status of refund as yet.Need the contact no. to talk to some official concerned.
I had opted for salon at home.she was supposed to reach by 1.30.When called she said she couldn't reach my number and it got cancelled.then I again placed it for 6.30 evening.it got rescheduled... Urban Company is going from good to pathetic in their services.will never again go for any appointments
It was Good and timely...
simply exlent service
Thoroughly professional, the entire process was completed in a smooth manner from start to finish. I'm completely satisfied. Thanks Urban Company.
Good
Very good service üëåüèª
service was good. she has spent enough time.
Disappointed with their service. Worst customer care experience. The professional didn't arrive but in the app it says service has started. And they don't even have a proper customer care number for us to reach out to them.
GOOD SERVICE IN ONLINE
Very good service providers
Last minute cancelations have become a norm. Use only if you don't value your time.
very nice üëç
excellent
Good experience till now
Good App
good service
Little expensive, but quality service.
Good Service
Urban Company gave some compensation for the theft that occurred during the paint work which i wasn't expecting. Thank you for taking feedback and taking some action.
I know I have the app installed. I know what kind of services are available. Can you guys just stop with these notifications that keep popping every 1 hour.
Very cheap .chep service.very bad don't use this app. Very bad service . Khali paise luat rahi hai
Has been a great experience till now
These guys have zero control over the partners. Worst experience.
Good service
Service was excellent. But payment portal in the app has problem.
Not thrilled about the new partner welfare fee. Snuck that in without any prior notice. Why add a tip then? The PWF negates most of the discount from the membership program. Also not happy about them switching how the membership works. Used to be a flat fee for 12 months. Now there's a cap on the amount of savings per membership, forcing you to buy memberships 5 or 6 times a year, depending on how often you use their services. It's rare to find a competent service provider most times as well.
I highly recommend this app for massage. stop going to massage parlor where women don't even know how to do massage. always get massage services from UC app.
UC is not available in all states
All its says no experts available nd there r some bugs in adding address ....worst nd management
Big time cheaters. They deducted the whole amount but still service was not confirmed.If the payment is failed then how can you activate the membership. They do every possible things to cheat their customers. They are big time froud. For their benefits they can go to any extent. From one transaction they pick the part which is beneficial to them rather than the customers. By selling their membership they cheat and do fraud with the innocent customers. Will surely file a case against them. Fraud
Worst experience with app, customer service and service people... No proper response, no option in app to escalate any immediate issue and for immediate resolution
great experience
They will not give jobs ,here only short time jobs,and travel take more money,if u work money will lose
Excellent Service in reasonable cost
Good work, satisfied
nice response..
People came for cleaning were rude mannerless and adamant that we will do this as not in contract. House is small and things are more....
Poor company. They made me wait for like 2 hours and after that they canceled my booking. Very pathetic and unprofessional behavior
Never comes at scheduled time and their professional never picks call . So please donot take their membership. Worst service.
Be cautious when planning for massage or beauty services, after an hr of wait they might cancel abruptly and ur day might get ruined.. disappointment
Not getting any option to schedule....location not detecting correctly...unable to add the address...
Your app seems to be having a problem. The main page is not opening up
I have been trying to book pest control service for the last 2 weeks. Everytime I try to book I get a notification no professional available in your area.
They are just frauds, fooling people.
Wonderful salon experience
Very bad painting service. Both sales executive and painter had cheated me. Pls be careful.
This review is not about the app this is about overall servics and my experience about those services 1: my wife booked service for some parlour work the work that perticular assigned worker did is ridiculos. 2: I booked massage service for my father where head massage is complementary but at last minute they said no you have to put separate order for same 3: Booked deep home cleaning service but again that assigned vendor did lots of scratches on my brand new chimney and furniture Worst! Worst!
amazing
Absolutely pathetic company with very unprofessional and rude people. They consider the customers their servants charge you for full service but change the provisions of the service as per their own convenience. Ridiculous...
Prompt, Quick & professional service...impressed indeed.
Interface is not user friendly... not able to book a carpenter service.. can your team help
I thinkHome services is very good. -The winter situation in the UC condition is very very bad, getting worse by the day of days..
Good and prompt service provider as well as the professional technical partners with Urban Company
I have taken the premium package for 12 months . However whenever I book any service I do not get any discount or privilege of the package.
I am trying to book but server is down since a week! Seriously u guys r working for playing jokes around?
excellent work
I booked a service, the professional didn't arrive, they rescheduled the timings 4-5 times, but still professionals didn't arrive.....Very bad experience and if there would an option of -1 , I would surely give .....very disappointed......
I am very disappointed.we got an appointment with the electrician Sundar between 4-4:30pm finally he came @ 5pm the Geyser switch was broken he said it will take him 30mins to get the switch we asked him to fix asap as there are 2 children aged 4 and 6 by 8pm he calls stating that he's got another work in Chickpet will come tomorrow @ 11am we waited but he didn't come finally cald customer service they did a conference call Sundar was very rude and unprofessional and cancelled the appointment
Pathetic service by @urbancompany_UC Had booked my salon service for 3.30 today and nobody turned up after confirming twice, at 2.30 and 2.50 pm. I kept myself free and cancelled my meetings just to get stood up like that? Plus you charge me 50 extra for your incompetent service?
Extremely irresponsible for UC for hanging me at the last moment. They canceled by booking twice and rescheduled and then called to inform they won't be able to send anyone. Is this a joke? Never going back to this app.
Sakalya, she came cleaned and arranged every thing. Polite, clean and took care about every thing. Thnx
Horrible experience and very unprofessional behaviour. We booked for their services 2 days prior to the requirement and the last minute they canceled stating there were no professionals available. You can't rely on their services.
Some professional are very rude and misbehaving with Coustmer.. specially kitchen cleaners
It is very good which provide the immediate service both prior telephonically and then physical visit.
Poor service. No value of time. Will never recommend anybody. Very Bad experience.
it was really good and hygienic
good service
They are charging more than what they showed in the app while booking, they will also registered double bookings at a time and will sent their professionals again and again for the same work and if say I booked only one and cancel the second their professionals will ask you visiting charge unnecessary. And there's no proper customer care no. to file complains. So expensive and very low Customer service.
Good Men at work.Done it very Professionally.
good Work and very nice
Good
Includes unnecessary charges in the invoice.
superbb relaxation
excellent
grt
Horrible
My expirience with this app not ebable to get in toutch with any costumer service when you need help.i book a made then they will change as they wish.and i m not able to cancel when i dont want the maid which they asigned.need to make option fir costumer service.
Very helpful
The work done perfectly, very nice and good
They just take your money and don't even show up. JUST DISGUSTING.
Very useful
Giving 0 star .. Made my first booking and service people made every one in home to upset by denied the service. Also he says bathroom cant be cleaned like shown in add and deep cleaning wont be usefull..poor service .No call back .No customer care service.. Better dont pay money in advance . pay in cash only if the service is done perfectly..
Good service
Very worst experience . Booked for a service . The person didn't come and the status was job done. The booking was prepaid. On registering a complaint, they arranged for re service on another day. Same situation got repeated. The service person didn't come and status was Job Done. Again registered a complaint. But no response from the Urban Company people.
Worst experience of service, professional didn't come even after 1 hr of schedule time...no call, intimation, customer service .. Will not recommend to anyone.
Worst technician and service, I urge everyone never to use urban services
Got my AC repaired for gas leakage. Problem occurred again same issue reoccured after 3 month this time it crossed warranty by 2 days and any visit was denied. They have incompetent service engineers and no regard for customers problems. I strongly advice not to use Urban Company for repairs of home appliances. It should be done by respective brand service centres.
Nice.. I like urban company
I booked medi and pedicure. Service is impeccable.
Exilent üòöüòöüòö
It's really good
Bad experience
Nani trap was broken, so I called for a plumber through this app. He asked for Rs. 5000 to fix it. I refuse it, still they charge me rs. 250. I got it fixed by a local plumber for rs. 800+ cement + mistri = 1300 total. Never gonna use this app again.
great service
Very bad prizes extra heavy charge
I asked for a 5 star professional do they assigned me a 0 star professional
1 person for three jobs.. shld send 2- 3 person to do 3 jobs..
They would like you to cancel the booking if there person delays the service. What a non professional company it is....
Super üíû be
Excellent
not worth the charges. got our house cleaned and they did a lame job
VERY GOOD EXCELENT
Terrible experience! Very rude staff. the girl's name was Jeanry Ramos Apiado. she came 1 hour late and then she left 20 mins before her time without completing the job. even the rooms she did were not cleaned properly from corners. dishes were not washed properly either.. really disappointed by the service. even the customer support is poor. nobody picked up the call to listen to the complain and address the issue. Thank you.
Bad bad experience. Still waiting for my refund.
Worst experience with Full home cleaning.the company could not resolve the issue.the assigned person is not good. I've wasted my money and time.
My experience so far has been good... But the last service was disaster and the company does not bother to address the issue. They have been giving me time for callback that they have changed 5 times .. and no one bothers to call.
excellent
amazing app.
Most pathetic service provider. Even when the slots canceled by themselves, they end up charging cancelation fee and offer to provide the same as uc credits and no option of waving it back or rolling it back. These guys need to learn from swiggy, zomato, Ola, Uber on how to manage these things. Rating was actually 0 but no option for 0 in play store sadly.
Professional. Customer oriented. So helpful. We didn't need to tolerate the tantrums of local electrician plumber etc. I am very much happy with this app. All things are done at home without any hassle. All you have to do is take mobile and book the service. And relax. ü§ó
good work
Good
The washing machine repair service is going on for a month and is incomplete. Only phone call followup is not going to resolve the issue. There is no responsible person to resolve. The technician is overburdened and unable to complete the job.
Bad App and Worst Customer Experience. Payment almost always fails. Can't book any service. No option to register complaint without booking. Messaged atleast 3 times over twitter and no reply. Registered complain over previous service to get in touch and for call bac but no one call back. If you don't want customers to book service then better shut the application.
This app is verry helphfull for all things
Very unprofessional. No proper refund given, fraudulent amd misleading in their customer interactions. V ery poor customer service and causing inconvenience. Very poor service provided.
They don't let you discuss the problem with the plumber or technicians before he visits. They just quote you twice the market price just for the visit. God knows how much the plumber will quote after visit. It's a waste app. Just uninstalled it. Not recommended.
Excellent concept BUT needs better competitive pricing... better deals salon or maid.. starting price AED50
The professional doesn't reach at the job place or receiving your call and chatting through the mobile with you......And the urban company customer service also doesn't respond.....Terrible experience
good service
Service is nice but price is very high.service and price not ok
Urban Company is the joke of 2021. They take a membership fee of 299 and you will never get the service. I challenge them to return this money to all the unhappy members. And I urge everybody who are having service issues to ask for a refund. This is a bogus company.
Wonderful services üíñ
Pathetic people giving services.......very bad service. Your beautician Madhuri Sawant is way rude to the customers and change s the scheduled services as per her convinience which is not acceptable......very bad behaviour
Nice
Bad overall experience
Good cleaning experience
No professionals are available message even before selecting the date of service. Why let me waste time selecting services, if you don't have professionals available for any day. Stop spamming my email with offers! Service in Sharjah is pathetic! If you don't have professionals, refund my membership fee.
good service from urban company
it's good
Rates are high
Good service

Value for money
Im unable to book service of a professional whose I liked previously and this has been happening for the last 3 bookings. How can it be that for the last 3 months the professionals service is scheduled
Very helpful

It's a FRAUD company which has ganged up with its so called professionals and defrauding customers. Don't get fooled. I got cheated of almost 2000/- If it weren't for my awareness, the loss would have been more than double that amount!
Very Useful Service. Best D2C. Good trained professionals.
Great professionals for help. Convenient and cost effective.
It's very affordable,very hygiene, safety measures are taken and easily accessible
excellent service

Excellent Service
Very good services. Especially the salon. Keep up the good work. The hair cut professionals are also very experienced and smart with thorough politeness.
Waste service ever. Just waste of time

Greetings of the day! I am writing this message with reference to the recent cleaning service done by you. I am extremely disappointed to share that *1.* The hangers of all our drawers, towel stands and knots in the bathroom area got rust due to the chemicals used by your team for cleaning. *2.* Chemicals used has also created a very bad and disgusting odour. *3.* The team which visited for the service had no civic sense. Once their tasks were done, they cleaned their fash in our basin,
I booked a service, the professional didn't arrive, no information, no OTP, the app said the service started and relax.... What a joke. I dialled an emergency help line, feeling guilty for using it but then this company has a different meaning for SOS... nobody picked up the call . That's a emergency helpline for you. I am a regular customer in Bangalore and never faced this issue there.. But booked this cleaning service for my new place in Chennai and this is what I got. Pathetic service
Good
They dare to rate you as a customer, give you a low score, and tell you that 80% of customers have a higher score than you. Its also hard to book the same professional twice because they just disappear from the list after a point
When is it available in warangal
My jet spray was broken during the service and the executive didn't bother to update us with the same. Moreover, no action was taken by Urban Company even after making a complain. Highly unprofessional.
Dear UC Today I opted for the pest control services. Your app showed the professional as vaccinated ,but he was partially vaccinated. My society doesn't allow partially vaccinated individuals because of which I had to cancel the service . Kindly reimburse my amount very soon and don't fool people around for your benefit. I want my hard earned money back.
Ko ismein booking mat kijiega Garib ki pet Maa Ke Aage Banna Chahta Hai
Trying to fool customers. Promises discount for members and then add same amount as visitation charges along with convenience fee
I have paid the electrician then too its showing in the app as incomplete payment.there is no proper way to reach out them
good service
PAVAN KUMAR M
I book a service for unistallation of led diwali lights of 20 nos from very convenient height no required any extra arrangement for unistallation only UC charged me 1258.00/- please avoid the electrician service from urban company
Shows price with safety and hygiene standards included but during checkout they add extra cost for safety and hygiene. Professionals are rude and trained to loot customers by adding unnecessary requirements, materials and charges. Local professionals are hundred times better than this app.
I always get the message that no professional available in your region. Wasted my money on its plus membership. I want a refund!
The most overrated company. With 0 customer centric attitude. Will definitely file a case in consumer court as they never get back to the customers. Had pathetic experience with beautician Neha Begum and further tormenting experience when you try to get in contact with customer care. Will never use their service and infact will share my experience on all social platforms so no one is fooled.
very good work and excellent job done by persons involved in alloted job üëè üëç üëå
Quick service everytime.
excellent car spa by uc...keep up the good work
Services going down.
Excellent service
Value for money.
Thank you for instant resolution of the issue. Much appreciated.
Horrible experience. Customer service is terrible. They cancelled my service yesterday and then called and apologised and said they'd send someone the next day. Cancelled again. Uc is now unreachable saying they will call in am hour. This is after I had to clear my schedule twice for their service. I'm done personally with this app and will make sure none of my friends and family members ever use it. Just waiting for my refund and I'm uninstalling the app
Great services, friendly staff üëç üëå üëè üòá
Very pathetic app , after money is deduced its refunding money as payment failure , it also makes me to think about company credibility and service ability .
Excellent
life saver. God's own company.
Worth !
excellent service
Excellent job. in future also will avail Services from Urban Company.
User friendly app. Customer service needs to improve a little bit regarding follow up of jobs which are not done as scheduled.

Very poor warranty service....had got a plumber service done 10 days back...the issue repeated after 2 days...have been trying to get the free revisit since a week...but the professionals are not coming on different pretexts ..the company doesn't take calls....and calls back at their own will ..as if we are sitting idle with no other work....will never recommend for such services...
Service quality and professionalism of the company is falling steeply. My bookings are being cancelled for two weeks now, without me having any clue about it There is absolutely no number to call on. Guess they have removed it in response to hundreds of complaints. No idea about my refund status either. I had made a booking for Wednesday, and now it has been postponed to Friday. If you're not interested in providing the services, why are you still operating? You are becoming Scam Company.
Continuous spam of notifications with no way of disabling them in app.
I hope traditional customers also get served by them.
Using Urban Company for many years now. I don't trust them for any expensive electrical or electronic work. They are good for basic jobs - cleaning jobs, salon spa services etc. Spent 4k on microwave repair, the replaced component blew exactly 1 day after warranty expired and the company is not ready to change/act on it. Got a deep clean, gas refill for AC lasted 4/5 months. Technicians are good, parts are bad. And the worst part, they are not willing to act on exception basis.
normalm
excellent service üëç
Un- trained professionals and not proper chemical being used .
My first ever review for any app, very disappointed with their services and lack of customer support. Never get pest cleaning or any cleaning for that matter done. They don't give you half the information and expect you to do the work after. Deleting the app and never returning. Years of being part of the service now I'm choosing to delete this
Customer service is pathetic. There no contact number whom you contact for any concerns.You can only raise your query or concern through the app and they will contact you based on their convenience not based on your availability. When I raised a concern about my item damage by the cleaning person they called me once and as the cleaning person didn't pick the call, he said he will call me later and giving miss calls with 2 rings and sending immediate message saying I am not reachable. Pathetic.
Very useful and reasonable price
Booked plumber and schedule was keep on postponing finally postponed to next day not expected like this worst service.
I don't lik to give a star...service was completely waste of money.. becoz of the service i had skin allergy n consulting Dr for it.. using worthless products..
Not able to cancel service. Not able to reassign professional for service.
These guys provide pathetic service. Customer success does not matter them
it's amazing
The professional cancelled my request. I planned my day around that appointment and this is completely unacceptable. She contacted me and assured me that she will be coming and after that she cancelled the request.
Honest worker.
I'm surprised there's no straight forward way to get support in case one has any queries regarding a booking. Only the FAQ section is available and nothing other than that.
Editing mt rating to 1 star would have given a big zero, if that was possible. Pathetic!
Worst people don't respond even after repeated complaint. Atleast after seeing this rating and comment responsible person should Cal me and discuss to solve the problem
I got rashes and very bad experience, for that a customer support executive of UC instruct me to purchase medicine from 1mg I purchased medicine of 947/- and she said they will reimburse the amount but they didn't. I took that service in last week of November 2021 and today is 14 December 2021. This was really worst experience I spend around 2500 only for two services and that happened with me. If UC is not capable for reimbursing amount you should not put your words for the same.
good services
Very pandemic-conscious service. Prompt, comprehensive, and well-trained staff. Super happy with plumbing, carpentry, electrician and salon services. Worth the money.
Worst recent experience. Now they are all about money and no customer service. First the professional arrived late, secondly she was extremely slow, Thirdly she did not complete all the cleaning in the house and fourthly I am following with the useless customer service who keeps apologizing but not bringing any sort of solution to it. Even after submitting the pictures to Ms. Shaina( UC customer representative) which she asked for NO BLOODY ACTION HAS TAKEN PLACE FROM UC. WORST SERVICE EVER.
Extremely poor customer service, unreliable staff and no number to make an urgent contact with customer support. Hire someone locally than depending on such a poor bunch of professionals
Booked haircut for my son, had a great experience. Very professional service. There are some issues with the App though, hope Urban Company can resolve those. Also, do provide chat option in app to resolve issues while booking, if any, or for any other assistance.
beautiful experience with so much comfort and care, professionally done the work, thank you
Not at all happy with the service. Did painting using their app last week and now repenting the decision. Not customer friendly at all. Pure money making business attitude.
Good
Nice
good
pleasant experience at comfort of home
awesome
UC expert doing repair my washing machine he said part will be replace and he take away after 8 days he said I don't know what is issue. He said you can call to samsung customer care they solve your problem. Urban company capable only for none technical work just like saloons or washroom cleaning üßπüßº
Best services offered... Professionals are also good.
excellent
No.1 brand for worst service. Dont use UC. Service engineer not even fixed single issue out of 3. But charged huge amount. When i raise complaint , customer care put both of us in conference and engineer literally in fire but customer care just listening. No solution out of it and asking me to book fresh service by paying the amount again .. They are grabbers.. Never use this service. If you directly bring technition he will do every thing for 1 day jao(‚Çπ800-‚Çπ1000).
Wonderful home cleaning services provided. Till date not disappointed with any . One suggestion to urban company. Please start Gardening services as well.
Bad Experience I had booked haircut The professional called me, I couldn't answer the call so he cancelled the booking on his own and I am being charged the cancellation fee
Very nice service
Good
The professional named Raju Chakraborty, has damaged my jet spray while cleaning the bathroom and i was trying to get connected with uc and the professional aa well but no response. I have to repair the damage by spending rs 760
The worst experience I have ever had with any service provider. Had ordered for a full house deep cleaning. A team of 5 people arrived in the morning & stayed for 6 hours. Didn't complete even one section of the house. Caused damage to our personal items, broke things, abandoned the work & left. Customer service was least bothered despite raising multiple complaints and asking for call backs. The team arrived with a vaccum cleaner which was not working for a cleaning service.
nice guy he did excellent work..
Friendly and helpful along with good cleaning services
User Friendly
Very good service provided...mr.priyanshu is a hardworker guy..he done his job very neatly.
good service
Good app
Best app for all your household work. Easy to boom, hassle free service, technicians know what they are doing.
Don't fall into their trap, I booked an appointment for split ac uninsatallation and I paid the full amount via online, appointment also booked and mechanic also alloted then after the technician called and updating that since the technician was not present in my area he told that he is going to cancel the order and the paid amount will get credit back to card, what is the logic here by trusting urban clap only I booked the service and paid full amount via online, finally I was cheated..
Cleaning work of our two bathroom are very satisfactory
Help center staff is very rude and does not provide any valuable solution to complaints raised. The entire team is very laid back and doesn't care about any concerns raised by the customer. They just boast professional service but most of them are unprofessional. Worst experience with Urban Company.
Excellent
There is no contact number to reach out to the company if we have any doubts before booking
Very professional company, have been extremely happy with all their services üòÄ
Very nice service
Very good app happy with it
I have booked appointment for haircut twice. You guys accepted the booking and called fifteen minutes before scheduled time that you guys are struggling for hair stylist and that's why u cancelled my booking one minute before scheduled appointment. If u don't have service providers, y do u accept bookings. You could have called earlier so that customers can find for some other option. This app can't be relied upon. Worst experience with any firm till now.
Nice experience
Very worst experience with Urban company. I will never recommend this to anyone and neither I myself will take another service for myself in future. The booked professional asked for a reschedule at last minute due to his two wheeler outage. Don't see a bit of professionalism here right from reaching to customer care to getting a professional assigned. Waste of time!!!
One hole from drilling machine is 100 rs seriously and another chargers if i want 10 holes urban company take 1000 + charges , and all home repairs is very costly
Nice
App not working to book a service since yesterday to me.
Price will be hiked for every 10 mins and app is not user friendly
first exprience is very bad....will never use this
I booked a service to be delivered 2 days ago. It was called off at the last moment. Requested it to be escalated and still waiting for a response. Their customer service is pathetic. Not at all reliable
Very bad experience with the deep cleaning services. My watch worth 60k, two cushions with beautiful cover and one Bluetooth speaker was missing after the services. And unfortunately I came to know after the warranty expired so I had no option left to claim . This is highly unprofessional and I trust the Urban company so I booked my services here but highly disappointed.
Very bad experience...... Did painting work so called Sid professional but all mess did ...... They took complaint and told that it will resolved in 24 hrs but it's 4days and nothing is done. And it's always shortly and 24hrs work but after 24hrs it's yet another 24hrs...... Hahahahahah no sense of responsibility as the customer must be having some function or any other things to be done. All this they know how to make money and no customer satisfaction they can do.... I'm highly disappointed üòû
First experience only was very bad with the app. Selected the service and UC membership paid the payment but the msg displayed that payment failed. But amount got debited from my account and while refunding they have debited 299 and returned. If they had said payment failed how come they got 299 is my question. I feel this is their technique of just fooling people for taking their UC membership.
excellent service
Bad service about pest control
Awesome
very happy with the services!
Worst service, I lost my money because of Technician (AC) -
Give more discount when festival is on..more discount means more customer..buy 2 service and get 1 free..
They cancelled my booking at the last minute. There was no option to contact them on app . Also another person could be assigned but that also didn't happen. Worst customer experience. Please do not spend millions on advertising . Use it wisely to set up a call centre. Edit : another person was assigned later on. Got my service done. However there should be a calling support where a customer can connect directly without having to wait for a call from the company.
The person deputed for hair cut was very rude and totally un professional. I cancelled the seevice because of the personnel. Wasted my time. Inspoke to him personally twice. And my secretary twice . So not being able to contact me is a lie.
Very disheartened with the partner welfare fee added without informing the customer. It is not up to UC to decide for us & make it mandatory to include the fee. When I took a 6 months membership, I locked it for that price. That's the reason why I opted for 6 months and not to find out one fine day that an extra charge has been added without even asking me. How can you, UC, decide to use my money for your Partner Welfare scheme. 48 hrs later still nobody has called me as promised.
good service
very good service in very reasonable charges
Nowadays we dont get any professionals for service. Mostly trainees are being sent. Thats quite disappointing. Atleast there can be 1 professional accompanied by the trainee. In the recent times work has not been upto the mark. Hope these issues are addressed in the future.
Exceptionally good
very good
Amazing Experience!
Whenever I tried to book a slot they don't assign anyone in time hence everytime I have to cancel the opted service and to have to wait for 8-9 working days to get the refund...it's better we should ask friends for the reference contact details. #sodisappointed
Good service.
Very bad experience professional was not appointed I wasted my whole day . When I canceled my service and ask for refund they deducted a big amount. Very unprofessional behavior
very good
very nice app
Definitely recommend
Excellent
Easy and convenient. Resolved the issue promptly
No customer care. No customer assistance. Adamant executives. No clear instructions to executives.
Good professional, timely and good services. Most recommended
Hopeless... destroyed my Italian marble bathroom walls...used acid to clean everything.... mirror was cleaner before...mica was dirty..... biggest mistake
Worst service ever seen
Not at all flexible always issues while booking for washing machines.. free consultation always try again I wil never recommend
Very expensive. Visiting charges, only are very high. Don't understand so much positive reviews because we can get these services from outside at very cheap rate.
thank you
UC app is not at all user centric. Cannot contact customer service for genuine issues and have to wait for eternity for their call. Their painting services are horrible with no responsibility being shown by the company! We have been shouting for the lack of professionalism being shown by their team but they keep evading. Our work is still in progress. They take the full payment and you are at their mercy, local guys are better than UC.Pathetic experience. Not ever using nor recommending it ever
Full of bad and fraud people's. Don't trust.
Process is important for UC, customer and his experience has no values.. pathetic services..local technicians are much better..
pathetic customer care
Beautician selected is never assigned...and they auto assign..at the end customer is left helpless but to go ahead with the new beautician
Excellent service üëç
Please ensure disliked partners are not sent on future bookings...also, have a contact no for any urgent queries. Your app does not help report above mentioned issues
Friend booked the appointment and it was cancelled without any prior intimation and I was the one who recommend Urban clap but know feel very bad and won't recommend urban clap to any one else Very disappointed with customer service If there was 0 in the rating I would have given that they don't even deserve 1 star
Good Services are provided.
good
good service
Services are good but app is pathetic... When you choose hair service and want to add skin salon with it, u can't do it, it unsaves all ur cart itesms once u more to other section......I can't book skin and hair service together once.....tried for 10 times atleast
Best services.. highly professional
Ok
Not at all happy with the services. Very highly priced for a small and cheap job. Locals will do the same job amazingly for that price. They were not on time. No prior communocation about delay. Price was taken before and after arrival the person said that the job cannot be done as required. UC didnot even care to refund or even contact about feedback. Very very disappointed. I would never recommend this to anyone. I felt cheated.
Perfect service for Saloon. Didn't try other services yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
Poor service as no one from customer support ever called me.
U have given sub contract I think.they haven't cleaned inside of kitchen drawers staying that they don't know how to take out n put them inside again.cleaned only outside n sides of inside.
No customer support
Charges for electrical things are to high. For one service your charging complete one year membership.....
Hi Team, I had booked a hair professional and he was outstanding at his service. His name is Vishal Parekh. Your app guidelines say that I can book that professional again but I am unable to find him. Can you please help assign him for my service. Regards, Shivam
I cancelled r.o insallation but, they have not return the amount
Good but bit expensive, cleaning done in professional ways
Wosrt experience services was rescheduled n cancelled after 3 days Waste of time
I am not able to generate the OTP. Cant even use the help options Just kept on buffering .... Fedup very bad experience
Registered service for deep Chimney cleaning. Paid 1298 via online. Again problem detected on chimney, again paid service charges when new assignged engineer checked the chimney it was quite dirty from inside. It is just 14 days happened on previous service. Now Urban Clap has decided to refund back whole amount 1298/-. The refund is paid not in bank, they just add it as UC CASH CREDIT, will be expired after 1 year. if customer is not happy and dont want Urban clap in future, what he will do.
They are going on increasing price of services, also taking 49 rs as a kit etc charges over and above total package is a big scam. Already the cost of products is not even half the package cost. Incurring so much profit by forcing customers pay more and more all the time
Good company best experience - AC repair ke liye best hai jarur bulaye ak bar Acha service hai Yaha ki "think you"
My recent rating is one star but it is updated as five star. It's redicules.
Terrible experience
Service is good. Keep it up.
The price of the service is too high as compared to the standard rates which are available in the market. Please don't use urban company as they are charging too much money for a simple service.
This company has recently cheated me.
Worst experience ever dont ever book from here
very good
Bad experience. I did book appointment at sat 11 th December and slot having 12th at 7pm till 7pm no service provider assigned to me i did complained twise at 7:10 pm i received a call that no one is available so it it your response toward customers? Now tomorrow i have flight at early morning So now where should i go and get appointment ? If you haven't find any beautician, why don't u inform me earlier? Who pay for my loss? I can't go like this. Will complain in customer forum also
Very bad experience with urban clap this was my first booking and they cancel your booking without informing me and best resolution customer service provide you after an hour call is to reschedule the appointment. There is no use of calling customer service. Customer is not priority for urban clap which is very sad since they are in service industry I would not suggest it to anyone Very sad n bad experience
Very Bad Service
Very bad service
Pathetic,un-reliable, most unprofessional, never go with urban company even if you find this few bucks cheaper. My experience Booking done for chimney deep cleaning, full amount pre-paid, service person (with a rating of 4.8 !!!!!) does not turns up, after following up on appointed time he makes excuses, requests for next day. Second day - again does not turns up, is not reachable, while Urban Company sits on the money all the while with lease concern about whether the service was done or not on the scheduled time !! Overall, least customer-centricity, they hope for customers to forget about their payment in such cases and refund only for complaining and agitated customers.. You would notice there is no customer care number to reach out to in case you have an issue, you need to drop the request and wait....
Reliable and professional üëç
UC must have a contact number. It is very difficult to reach them out when our issue is not listed in the Help.section of the app.
nice
good
Very good service
I had booked for deep cleaning of my bathroom. My experience has been UC makes big promises but when the professional comes , they say that only 30% of stains can get cleaned. Both the professional and help desk are more keen to cancel the service than to help the customer. This is my second bad experience. I had asked for chimney cleaning that was working , after the cleaning the motor stopped working and I am left with a chimney that doesnt work.
Very very goodüëçüëçüëç
mr.fahad Younus never picks
I scehduled an appointment for 4 the beautician rescheduled for 5pm and then didn't even show up! Such ridiculous and unprofessional service !!!
Bad service they didn't inform me when the barber had said that he couldn't come to my house. It was an emergency and they have a very bad service.
EXCELLENT PROFESSIONAL SERVICE, I HAVE GOOD ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOUR.
just wooaw service they are providing
Foolish app I have ever seen .. m book a packaged for my wife from last a week don't have any appointments üôÉ
best service with professional staff üòä
very good service and she was very good
Good and detailed work
Excellent service provider. All the services we have tried have been beyond satisfactory and convenient. We are regular users of UC because the service is great almost every time!
bhut achha service hi urban company
Had a very poor experience with urban company. If u cannot provide the service as promised just shut down the business.
excellent commitment in work
My appointment was rescheduled for 2 times n there was no such option to call the service center by our own to know the reason y this is happening...
Very helpful app, well done developers.
Good job
Warning ! Dont choose Urbanclap. They may sound professional but they are not. I had a very disappointing experience with their home cleaning service. They sent 2 young boys with whom we had language issues - it got even worse as their work was so incomplete and we were not able to make them even understand that they have not cleaned the place properly. People from the S.Indian states pls think twice before using Urbanclap. If you still wanted to, go for it but be prepared to get disappointed.
Way to expensive
No Certainty in assurance if service professionals follow COVID safety measures ; the exact response I got from the UC CSR person is " wearing face shield soley depends on the haircut professionals & UC cannot assure on it." UC has to remove videos from advertising there is mask & face shield worn by their assigned professionals OR stop providing services to kids until kids are vaccinated if UC is pretty casual with it's business & least bothered in providingservices as per customer preferences
Good work
The worst service I have ever received. In banglore city they surely assign the professional but they have no professionalism to actually get the service done. I have had three services booked but did not receive any service as they are too busy and always have their slots booked even after they have given the customer the slot. They have no option to reach them out nor do they bother that their professionals are not delivering and only rescheduling the services asked for.
Always the assigned professional cancels the request on the time of delivery the service. Worst management
Urban clap customer service is not good. They don't provide proper bills for the services
good
Great
Cuatomer support is pathetic..i am repeatedly assigned the same therapist whom i dont want
I have schedule hair massage at Urban Company , yesterday evening at 8:30 pm , I got a call that due to rush I need to reschedule the and arrange next day at 12 noon. I scheduled for the same and again on next day I got call just 1 hour earlier that again due to heavy rush it won't be possible to schedule today I need to reschedule.. Such pathetic service and however if they don't have adequate staff why are they providing services ..
Prices are too high. Chocolate wax package is of Rs 499. However they charged me Rs 799. Thats really horrible.
Pathetic experience unprofessional service and behaviour. Forced me to take membership did not render service and now refuse to refund my money back. Pls don't use their services for anything.
3rd class experience, 3rd class service by the company. If you have any issue then there is no way to talk to them, video consulting service sucks. When you going to book your video consultation again then they will not assign any person to support you. Please go in market for best service, they will definitely provide you the best service.
Very bad experience of kitchen cleaning
EXCELLENT SERVICE
Bad experience for last 2 times service provider (saloon services) refused to come at the last minute .Even after 1st day refusal 2 of the company people called and apologize for the same and said it will never happen again pls take the services next day so I again booked and same thing happened the girl refused to come at the last minute
No proper customer care service.
Worst service I have book the slot for weekend No professional assighned for Saturday Team said n request us for today Sunday As such no professional assighned today as well Completely I lost Saturday n Sunday Unprofessional comments Don't believe these guys
Great
Professional and good support.
Last time i had a bad experience related to the customer service but this time the process was smooth and profesional assigned was very good in her work. Changing my review after her service.
The developer is deleting my review. Bhai app mein bug fix kar le. Paytm wallet link option is not working.
I booked hair stylist but he didn't turn up even after full advance payment. Helpline is also not responding. Seems a platform of Con (THUGEE). Sandeep Raizada
Good job
Earlier it was really good but now pathetic service, extremely poor quality of work, sheer waste of money
fantastic work and very polite in his behaviour.
very good service

best app for all home work

Worst experience at the very first time.
excellent
I am paying 49 extra for my sanitization kit etc purpose, but urban company is not taking care of this part. Poor covid protocol maintenance.
excellent technician and service from UC
vry expensive
Not even able to align anyone internally even for a simple haircut. Have to repeatedly reschedule for this issue. Initial experience has been extremely poor. Not sure if I should recommend this app or service to other people.
Very usefull
Horrible App. There is no cart or package system. Everytime you have to go in each section and add the services and if in case you need to add some another then again you have to restart
Video consultations only in Hindi is very bad...may be urban clap is thinking Hindi speaking people are citizens
Where are my reviews about UC going? Are they getting deleted by UC because the ratings are low? This is incorrigible.
Rating your customers ? ... great idea...btw I tend to always rate the service person a 5 unless something was terribly wrong with the service....the one star is for you deciding to rate us customers....just a constructive criticism Also btw, as I type this the service tech who is supposed to attend my 0900 am booking still hasn't shown up till 1015 ..just one tiny example...not going to recount more past experiences
Worst app, then don't even response soon if their professional are not available after assigned nd not even able to contact with their help center, u request for callback nd they ll call u , according to their mood, and not giving the proper response, and disconnecting the call after calling and the name of representative is sherline
Pathetic Service from Urban Company
We booked full home cleaning services. But the assigned staff(Rashid Mia) called me and told that they will come delayed since another customer who booked in later schedule has suddenly requested for early service. Still I accepted. But after sometime he cancelled the service without any intimation. The assigned staff name is Rashid Mia. If ever he is assigned for your service never trust him. Just ask urban company to assign a different staff.
Hi when iam trying to use the service of URBAN clap its not working.
Nice
Urban clap was much better .
Very useful and efficient.
Great service
Fantastic...
Good
Sup
I am happy with urbanclap
I took two times service @1st one was last year i was in emergency situation they charged lot me 4k for changing all the filters of my ro purifer then this year was 2nd was also emergency for my same ro water purifier same to replace all filters it costed me 3.5k discount was there ...but ur technician spoiled my ro led indicator light he told me he will come again to replace it within 15 days but he didn't do so now his not answering my calls i was not gonna pay him he was rude behaviour
overall experience is good
The professional used Scotch Brite on my fridge and put scratches on it all over. I reached out to UC for help but no response from them. Extremely disappointed with the customer service.
No option to talk to the executive. How do I know what service I am paying for. Suppose sofa cleaning: 7 seat cleaning...does 7 seats includes 7 cushions ? Where do I get the ans from ? I m not able to find that option.
no option for changing location, plus membership discount is 50rs so at the checkout its of no use as 50rs is added as convenience fees
I give 5 stars for very truly professionals, God bless your organization. Advocate Rahmat

Very good experience with the cleaning service professional
Good service, feels like I got a vendor to do my work
Highly ureliable,Accepted booking for 5pm and then unabale to assign staff till 6 pm , we were so dependent on this booking that we did nt opt for any one else, if the urban company is not able to provide services and assign staff, why they have accepted booking?Must say ,dont rely blindly on them
Excellent experience, wonderful service
Very poor compny
Extremely poor service. Unreliable company
for balcony cleaning, the person did not clean wall under railing as it's only floor cleaning. I paid 199 for that. In 100, my maid would have cleaned the whole balcony. Person do not carry foldable stairs to reach ceiling fan. I do not have foldable stairs, that's why I called UC. they shud mention in the service about the things which will not be done n the things which person will not carry.
my first experience was perfect
All the time the assiged person will be coming late
Booked an appointment for specific beautician. Urban Co. changed beautician without checking with me first.
nice
This happened not once but twice. Either beautician not assigned at all or when assigned, they request to cancel last moment. Was looking forward to a positive experience after the first instance. Really miffed.
Bit costly but service are satisfied
Hi, Very bad experience...ytour technician(Jamshed Alam) has been damaged my AC outdoor he has put down his leg on outdoor and trying to fix the indoor and it was fell down from 2nd floor which seems he has not fit the outdoor properly and now he is blaming that the wall is weak .They are not resolving the issue and not follow up with customer about the status its been already 2 weeks this incident was happened but no appropriate response till now.i need new AC Outdoor or atleast compensation
Even 1 star is more for you. Booked for cleaning. But no professional. Trying to get help even that's not possible. Please then don't accept the booking, waiting from morning onwards. Still nobody has called to inform. I didn't expect this service
Very niceüëç
Yeah nice üëç
very good service I am very glad
Happy Service. Transparent pricing.
I could not find customer support option on the app... I have booked for AC installation at 9:30 AM slot and now it is 14:10, yet there is no communication from technician... Could not find any option to report it...i could not contact the technician either... Worst service...
Very nice experience,very well service...
Excellent
Very good and professional salon service provided.
Your team has very professional people, I have been using UC for long time and I am member too, I have got washing machine repaired, and bathroom cleaning. So there is no way I can point out at the service, you guys are really ossam.
Unprofessional service personnel appointed.No suppy at all from them
Service is not good for past 5 times
Not as per expectation
The professional had very unprofessionally fitted my refrigerator with cheaper part of Rs. 1800/- and charged me for expensive part of Rs. 2800/-. Above that I get to know this after 1.5 years when the cheaper part again broke down. Shame on your services.
I cannot reach anyone from urban company to express my concerns and inform about my grievances
Very Bad and very unprofessional. The Customer has to tune in to the whims and fancy of these people.
Good
I would have give zero star Why u people bit provide customer support number What is the customer support number? Is this the way to run a company? Pathetic Spoiled my whole day for searching your customer support number Bad blessings to u
No proper update.I have booked full home cleaning for 8AM slot without intimating to the customer first it was rescheduled to 9:30AM and then to 11AM and finally after waiting 4-5hours they have told we cannot provide the service today.I have raised issue then support is just telling we will update you and don't raise any other ticket Moreover I have booked the service two days before.If professional is not available then atleast you should intimate to the customer before.Wasting customer time.
This app also removed the my negative experience.. Worst service provider company.. Would never recommend anyone to take service from Urban Company. Had it been like there would have 0 star, i would have given it a 0 star.
Professionals are punctual but services are not impressive
They use cheap quality of chemicals for cleaning Chimney mesh. The professionals are very good but they can't help if the chemical is useless. UC needs a lot of improvement. I will never use their service directly atleast for Chimney cleaning unless they change the chemical
very useful app, but need on call support also, most of time booking appointment for some services and technician saying not covering this services for your appointment.
Very professional and polite staff. Only if tariff and rate card are reduced little, then I'll give 5 ‚≠ê
Ok good ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Worng app
Horrific on several occasions. Their salon partners have cancelled on me after confirming my appointment at 4 different occasions. Pathetic. And then UC has NEVER found me a replacement.
Professional reject the service just before the appointment.You never get full refund. Then you get irritated and keep on calling customer care who don't have any resolution to your problem rather than promising next time it won't happen the same. But UrbanClap would not care. Really a harrassment for the customer.
Nice services
Worst experience + they don't have any professionalism
i am injured but eanted an haircut.. this app i installed wasted 30min of my time.. in pain. to tell me that service is not available in my area..
No body comes on time. Book what ever you want, they will never come on time. Booking slot concept is a joke.
Pathetic services. They don't assign a partner until an hour before the scheduled time and then cancel at the last minute as they couldn't find a partner. Waste of money and waste of time. Never rely on them to provide the services.
Nothing works on this app except for booking service. Have been trying to contact via help option, sos option and contact us option nothing is working
Pathetic service..they ruined my bathroom marble
Best service
Rajesh, professional hair dresser,
I booked mom n child haircut and blow-dry. The person who came, did not know the basics of either of them. Extremely disappointed. They need to really employ well trained staff. I felt cheated. Money gone and zero satisfaction.
monitoring of service rrquired
Cancelled my appointment not even at last moment. Informed me when half hour was already past my time slot.. i had to travel in 2hours.. and they don't have a spare.. absolutely non reliable.. so irritating.. they don't think of customers urgency or necessity.. i hate this app..
How to use urban acko care plan not show in app
I have heard a lot about this and taken this service , but i have opted for the painting service from this , this is very bad service i got , the cleaning was not at all done properly and when we raise a complaint no one is ready to set it out , they have spoiled my complete house flooring g
I dont find it worth. You should keep ur Employees happy to get good or wow customers. Apps need lots of Changes. Its filteration is worst. Like I am from Bandra mumbai the Agent will have to travel all the way approx 10 or more than 15 kms. So these tells the whole story. As an Developers people need to make sure they make productive and worth coding. Faking with people syntements doesnt runs business successful for a long period of time. It slips down one day with lots and lots of negative FD.
No way to reach customer service. Very user unfriendly. Pathetic app.
No customer service post raising complaints. Raised 2 complaints today but no one bothered to call or address the issue.
This is a very amazing app I am very happy and I am suggested to all please download the app and one more than try
Had very poor experience with Urban Company house cleaning services. We had booked full house cleaning service for our apartment. Agent called 3 times before visit forcing us to take upgrade services. As we needed only basic services.. we stuck to our required services. Assigned agent visited apartment and started insistimg to upgrade. When we requested to do services prebooked he spoke rudely and declined services. Fail to understand how Urban Company can FORCE customers to upgrade services.
Overall experience was good. However, prices can be on lower side
Rate is very high,
Awful the person who was allotted called n we had an interesting conversation. UC beware of people like this.
Struggling with personal chef booking. When I called up person assigned, he is saying he has conflicting booking and he will not be available. Have called multiple times but no resolution provided. Extremely disappointed with the service. No resolution. Every time new person calls a d confidently promises that they will arrange some one but nothing done. The most pathetic service ever. Concerns are already shared. What else you want. Concerns already shared. Are you blind. No response from 6 day
Good company
very good
The app is vy slow....I booked my slot for morning but couldn't make the payment after several try and when the executive called me after my complain he asked me to make another mode of payment assuring me of booking the slot at the same time but I couldn't made the payment since the slot timing was unavailable then...disappointing
Thank you Urban Company. It will be difficult to live in cities without your platform services.
Very helpful app, if you are new in the city.....
Super app
Chor company hai ye mere geyser KHARAB kar Diya pura or complaint karne pe muje pe hi penalty laga di.mat bulana UC KO 1 Kam karne ayegaye or pura ghar ke saman KHARAB kar dege unprofessional electricien hai inpe kin electricieno ko koi nahi rakta une ye Rakte hai.
Service is very good
Worst app..they will book ur service ..but will never provide you the assistance and will cancel ur booking without prior notice..waste of tym..since last 1 week m not getting the service
Very bad customer service (call center). They don't follow up with the service providers and I have to reschedule two times for a full home move in cleaning service. Service provider did great job but UC customer care is disgusting.
very calm and composed person... completed work perfectly...
Good experience
recommended
Service was excellent...
good
Fantastic
Terrible, my washing machine stopped working the day after the repairs. I am not able to register this on urban company app, no email or phone no is provided. U need to be more customer friendly
excellent service
Poor service. Wasted my time. booking scheduled for 3 pm waited for 15 mins later I called her but not picked my call or not responded through chat. Waited more than 1 hour. Then cancelled my booking.
Amazing service
Very gud experience.he was very sincere and done gud work
Very bad experience
Mr Sandeep Saini is very professional, really happy with hair cut of my son done by him.
Good
Very prompt work and punctual.
uc is coming to our rescue in pandemic time
Good experience. Thank u
it's said that first impression is the last impression. And mine first call with urban excutive was best. Hope it will remain same for future too.
Frustrated with the service
Nice facilitators of all type of services. They provide common and trusted reach to trained professionals. Have a good customer care who follow up and ensure satisfaction of customer. Still 4 star because they could not provide bill for the spare parts and they try to shed responsibility as they say they are only facilitators however they also got the parts so its bill is also their responsibility
Good service till now as no issues faced.. Only the price for small works are high...
we had opted for their move in bathroom cleaning service. Their professional broke our clothes holder and then even failed to mention it. He placed it in such a convinient way that when I checked it after the work, nothing seemed out of the way. The next day, it came crashing down on the floor. And then their customer care is denying any help saying that the professional is denying breaking anything. Dont use this app because this company tries to take care of their workers not their customers.
Great app! The personnel they send are always efficient and brilliant at what they do.
One of the best
Excellent Service
useless app..their technicians takes 15 days to solve simple problems.
so sweet
It used to be really good before and I have booked with them many times im the past but since they have made new changes and have different level of packages they have become pathetic. They confirm your booking but dont assign a professional. Their app says will assign 1 hr before the time slot booked. Then they call and say v don't have any professional. If ur depending on them finished. Ul never get the service done. Also they don't give u back the discount coupon code used for that booking
My schedule booking time at 10. Am but the men arrived at 11 am and sujjested better to cancel the schedule and U need machinery men to clean the bathrooms and cancel the schedule by him in my phone
Great app for housewives and working women..... üëçüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª
Work is excellent and very efficient
Very bad experience. No response from customer care after repeated complaints. One person has taken my tv for repair and I vent been provided any update even after a week and half and that too after trying to contact the customer care multiple times. Regret taking a year's membership. I wish I could opt out now.
Still having professionals who are not fully vaccinated Very bad from UC I canceled a booking as the professional had only 1 dose back in May 2021 You are putting customers at risk
Just Pathetic. They have no respect for customer's time. Booked my appointment 2 days advance for home cleaning at 10AM, at 10.15 i got a call that the maid isn't available, they forcrd me to reschedule at 5PM. I told the guy i am expecting some guests at 3PM i need the house cleaned before. But still, he kept saying 5PM, and I had to cancel the appointment. How shameful is that? Use some other company if you value your time.
Very unprofessional beauticians. They change their time basis their convinience & do not even bother to inform. Comapny takrs one hour to respond to your query....and this is when I am a paid member. Very disappointed
Extremely costly and unprofessional services.
Very pathetic app, not able to see any coupon code. Very bad experience with the app.
I m not able to see the coupon codes. Very bad experience.
Great service
good application for senior citizens
No way you can contact the company. Booking was for kitchen cleaning service and made online payment no one was assigned even after 5hours of booking time, I took a subscription along with the first booking, big mistake did not see the reviews or sample their service first, should have been careful as there was no contact details. They take you for granted as no body can call them. Now some one from UC will just write a reply for this review and I will not know in what capacity he is authorised.
Urban company cheats customers. I was trying to book a service and the payment failed. Within seconds they said that the price of the service has gone up.. why? Their AI recognises you are on the app and want the service and surges the price just like MMT, OLA etc.
Initially the services were timely. Since 2-3 months my bookings are getting cancelled at the last moment. I am a working person, who has to manage everything timely. Now, they are not even informing if the professional will reach you or not. We just keep waiting to get cancellation at the end. Why dont you inform your customers early so that they dont rely on you! And even I have bought their membership plan, this is what is happening after that.
very good, convenient services provided by urban company. Professionals are very polite.
One stop destination for all the personal and home services.
I regret availing verious repair services through Urban Company. It seems they are recruiting unqualified technitians and charging top rates. Replacement of washing machine spin motor was done in August 2021 and it is out of order now. I have spent Rs. 2500 and it is wasteage now. They supply sub standard parts.
Poor Painting service, lost 11küòû and they are not giving the refund as well. I room I painted with Asian royal water resistant paint. The paint is duplicate and the painters are not skilled. The paper tape is peeling the paint off. I requested for refund many times but they are not giving
Nice courteous technician with covid appropriate care
The urban clap company know's the best ethics of steeling money from people, evan I got robbed by this company
The latest version of app is not working on Android phones. It is so annoying. After selecting services and clicking "pay to proceed" all you get is a blank page. Being an IT professional myself , I know it's a bug in app from last 1 week. Company should have a way to book services via customer care as well if these kinds of bugs exist for so long. It's a sheer disappointment. I am amused how does a company live with this bug for so many days.There must be a better way to reach Customer care
Best service in reasonable price üòä
No option to contact them in emergency before booking. No customer care number. Not even a chat option.
Babu done a good job üëè
good for appliance repair and mens hair salon work!
On 9-12-21 ,opted for bathroom cleaning worst experience this time camode ventilator windows and flooring have left without cleaning I was busy in my work
very Good service....santised products used. . Good behaviour with the customer....üëåüëå
Worst experience. I am a working woman and had placed a request for service at 7am on 10Dec. A beautician got assigned few hours of placing the service. On 9Dec 9.21pm, the beautician raised a request for rescheduling. Unaware of this, I call her at 7am and she assures me she is outside my bldg. When she does not come within 5mins, I check if she got the bldg right..that's when I realise she has gone to somewhere else for service and will not come to my place. Highly disapptd. Not professional
Good job
Full paisa vasool, clean very well and do it till you are satisfied.
Grt services polit good manners
Excellent app
My payment is cancelled but money deducted
Great üëç
The worst app ever, I paid for UC plus services but it keeps showing that I don't have the membership. I'm not able to the services that I paid for.
Very Bad experience,I wasted 700 rs money,which package i took even tat cleaner person don't know.Very unprofessional service,in ad Dey show gud but in reality dey Don't clean properly i recommend don't waste ur money
What kind of app is this, I tried so many times to download, it's complete 99% then process is stuck, it's disgusting,how can someone use ur services without download ur app. Highly disappointed.
Update 9/12/21 .Does no one has humanity leave the customer service atleast HUMANITY? Ur enginee has stolen the lever and went off and that has been verified and accepted and now I am asking u guys to send the engineer to unlock it now ur saying warranty ? It's for replacement only .not for the stolen spare parts?the best part is company is happy with membership fees and engineer happy with his job.and the customer doesn't matter Who cares, unwashed cloths and unwashed cloths in locked machine ?
Nice and good app now.!
Service is very bad and they send unprofessionals for work...
How to lodge complain or connect to help centre ? is not working.
Nice app
Very bad experience wid saloon service
Good job done
Very worst expertise. I have booked for ac shifting with this company. However the technicians came to pick the ac very late. In between they took their personal break for around 30minutes. They started installing and fitting of the ac at around 1pm in the afternoon and completed the work at 6pm in the evening.
great service
very good and timely service. the technical person was very good and fixed the job in no time.
Excellent service
Very good service
They don't hire responsible people for the services, Worst Salon services are provided, Sofa cleaners, bathroom cleaners, electricians are never on time, and they have no proper cleaning equipments as urban company shows in their app. People are fooled by urban company aka urbanclap üëé
Professional are highly unprofessional. My booking has been done and professional assigned to me has cancel 1 hour before. I was in urgent need of the service and on the last moment she has cancelled.not only that she had called me whole day continually during my working hour for come early. Highly dissatisfied and disappointed Do not book salon from UC
I have scheduled a chimney cleaning service on 7th December 2021 and was directed to pay through my UPI after the payment I didn't any sort of booking scheduled in my bookings , I've been trying to contact everywhere, try to help me out in this .
was really a good experience.......
Good job
It's pathetic they cancelled the booking from their end and deduct the money for prime membership not giving me first time user discount plus after cancelling they are counting that cancelled booking used for service purpose.. Not willing to help it!!!
Why are charging cancellation charges when I havenot booked the service so kindly call me back
I was their customer but not willing any more to have their service as they use my trust and did extra charges without noticing as name of partner welfare fee. It is very unprofessional to deduct from my account without my confirmation.
No option to edit or save addresses along with custom mobile number in profile. Too much hassle of inputting details everytime.
Very bad unprofessional work. do not go for painting work very bad ..company is not bothered who is working no response ..no contact no. Help centre is there no action and response..
Horrible.....they dont care to collect the material for the services....and just cancel the appointment s wthout any reason last moment...the ppl hired are unprofessional....dont go for it
very good
Beauty Service...loved itüëç
My experience till now has been overall satisfactory except 1-2 occasions
nice cooperation
Worst experience
got Good Service for washing machine repair
superb excellent
Worst experience even after buying uc plus membership
I wish I never opted for Urban clap services for hair cut it's bakwas and such a shoddy cutting I can't even go out with this hair cut now. She cut it so short never left any option to alter it...plz dont go for hair cut service unisex salons are better than UC. Plz compensate me for spoiling ny hair and look...never in my life I faced such embarassment. Idiot have no sense just chopped off my hairüò†üò°üò°üò°
good service
very good response
Wonderful app with clear details and very nice and helpful
Very usefull when needed, however prices are slightly high for some services
I advise you not use urban company not better service for this company not refund amount of your cancellation booking
Technician ko lut rahahei
Got cheated for 2500 rs. I am changing 5 stars to 1. Support also not responding from 2 week. Terrible experience
Unable to use coupons. No way of speaking to the team for redressal.
Worst service,I booked beautician from Urban company but they dont have beautician available, they just say we will arrange someone but no beautician has been assigned. Booking from UC is just waste of time, they all made fake promises.I won't suggest UC to anyone.
Excellent service by the technician Mujahed..he solved all the problems with patience and was very helpful..
very good service
good app for day to day needs
very good efficient service.
good one
Customer call center - no direct number. Call back option is also not on time, taking 3-4 hours. The assigned person is not available. Just for reassignment, I am still nit able to reach them for more than 15 hours
This is the worst app I ever used ,I suggest not to use this useless app
Fully satisfied with services
Pathetic whenever their personal reach early they start charging waiting charge if they don't come on time even after calling so many times there single excuse sorry for inconvenience
Shareing my recent experience when I booked the services for fixing a problem with my RO from Urban company. The technician came earlier then the time slot which made me happy but then after inspection he quoted Rs 3500 plus taxes for fixing the RO which was bought at a cost of Rs 5000 some eight months back. Shocked at this I denied taking the service and then got the same fixed at Rs 500 from a local technician and saved Rs 3000. This is how the company is making a customer fool.
Most unprofessional service provider , mis communication, wrong commitments are just a few i can put here...
need staff who solve customer problem on the activity end to end, perhaps the staff need more experience
Worst service and customer care. My washing machine is not r paired for last 15 days and there is no proper response from the technician or the customer care. I had made sommany calls to the technician and Urban clap but of no use. The spare part is also taken and there is no response at all. Please don't avail any service from Urban Clap for washing machines. It is better to call the company service centre. Urban clap and their technicians are unprofessionals.
Excellent üëç
These guys are so irritating. I applied for a service through Amazon pay. I cancelled it within few mins of booking on 23rd Nov. I am yet to get refund. I have sent them bank statement linked to Amazon pay, Amazon pay statement and everything. Now theu are saying you go an talk to bank. Useless team. Not a stable payment and reconciliation system. Only works if you pay and avail service. If you are expecting refund etc. Forget about it.
It's been 4 years I have changed the location but not available in our area which is in guramguda road
very poor experience for last one week I assigned for a professional, this team is not able to assign in this 5 days..
Very nice
Love their salon services a lot, they take proper safety measures and all services are good.
this app makes life easierüî•üëåüèª
Wax After doing so, red rashes will appear all over the body
Good service
My membership is going a total waste as they never assign a professional. This has happened n number of times in the last 2 months including today. We cannot avail any services thanks to lack of availablity of staff. Cheats. You robbed me of my membership money. Return it.
It's a very bad company kyu ki na ye apne uc partner ki hai na customer ki hai ye company so koi service na le
Very bad service
Good service. service Is safe and clean. All are experienced and well trained. They are friendly too with costumer.
Wrost
Worst company ever !!
Before tody My experience was not bad...but today I got really disappointed...if u don't have enough professionals u should stop taking bookings ...
Good and genuine service
She was so good at her worked. loved this service
Great service for hair spa
Wrost service two times .bakwass hai
it's good
Good
Good followup once we book a service. Followed up even after completion of the work to get to know our satisfaction level. Services are reasonably priced.
The rates are comparitively high and the executives assigned charge 4 times more for the products than what is the actual price.
Review yr dec 2021--- now membership discount is less as convience fee in name of covid ppe still taken. Thats y no benefit as a memeber and if login as new cutomer that time also no benefit coz rate change. Review yr 2019 ---Its salon at home services are really good. but definately recommend salon packages for both men n women. i rate 4 star for pune location.. mumbai professional for salon at home service experience was very bad. suggest for parlour in malls but not to take from UC.
Very nice
Nice services online very good flat from All in service
Quality of Services provided dropped drastically after the Covid crisis. They do not send the company you choose. They have inefficient partners. They reschedule without your permission.
I have called Urban Co. for my television repair. The service was good but I think they overcharged me for the service. For 5-10 minutes of service they charge me for 3000/- rupees which I think is very high. The service cost was very very very high. I am very disappointed.
Not able to load content properly it's horrible.....
Urban company did not give my refund......
Waiting for last two days for call back .. still waiting. Very bad experience with urban company.
nice and professional person
good service
Good service
superb app for all services
nice work by technician
There is no customer care number I don't know why it is not there I need customer care number I want make booking on call
Excellent work done by monika
I am waiting after booking it, they have already Taken my Money, I guess all they do is make Fool of the Ppl, I guess this is something sort of a Scam..
Good apps
very convenient for getting the right person to do the work
nice work
Perfect job, handled geriatric with complete care and patience
Customers are rated by this app?? Who gave right the company to rate customers?? U have been paid for each and every service u offer. Nothing is offered free.. The company Don't have any right to rate us.
nice work
Service provides properly exactly what we need.
Excellent
Ease of access to most of the daily essential services.
Excellent service
location not search proper area
Love the services
Tactical in dealing with customers...bad strategy for the brand.
Very bad company and bad service
Not good company
You people are the worst ! You people show different packages classic and premium but the workers you send say it's not our problem what the company puts , we will do only how much we can , we book at 9 , they come at 10:30 , still did not start work and they say we have another booking at 11 we have to go . I will never go through this company and make sure people I know wot use this app ever again ! Even 1 star is too much to give you people.
We got good advice and service!!
They are highly unprofessional. I have booked an appointment and no body and and no one even bothered to inform in advance. Somebody cancelled my order without my consent. My money is still with them...
They have good professionals and equipments. Cleaning things made simpler by UC.
From so Long I m trying for bathroom cleaning I m not getting slot
Slots are never available
I have made cash/online payment for all my bookings, but why does it show payment pending still? Also I am not able to book any service, it says no service in my area. I think there has to be a proper system in place to update payment. No service person leaves without collecting their service charge.
Poor app and atrocious customer care service
great app for any people looking for a household service. recommended for all age groups.
Without any intimation they rescheduled my booking date waste of time.Extremely disaapointed with the service.Think before booking any service on this app its waste of time and your service won't done on booked date .
The app takes the booking and then the professional is not available
Pathetic. They would never assign a technician for any kind of work.
good
Plumber section of the app is not loading.
Very High Price
Sofa repairers not available in your app!
To difficult to operate.
Great job
thanku
ok ok
Very poor service don't pay online pay only after work is completed all services are incomplete if paid in advance
The best app for connecting customers to top class technicians. I have always had a great experience with Urban Company and the technicians provide top-notch service at competitive rates.
Good urban company
This isn't first time, I'm reinstalling it because it's good for me personally! Good appü§ü
Good to go for Urban clap for such works
nice company
Excellent
Timely reasonable and helpful service by Mr. Daniel Chennai
very much satisfied and happy with the professional.
Never again. I got 4 different service and none of them were satisfactory. There are lot better options available, first you think it is good cause it is cheaper but finally u understand why it is cheap. Actually since the service is not satisfactory, you get it agsin and it becomes even more expensive. Only time I asked for re-cleaning cause first one was horrible, I was told that it is already a week and they can't help if I dont complain in 48 hours. Thanks for even not trying!! Worst

I had a concern related to coupon. I had raised the concern to the Urbal clap team a month ago and till date the issue is not resolved. worst experience with you..there was conversation with you people in mail for about 30 times..
very poor service by his customer service agent , initially the bill was 548 for geyser installation and later invoice of Rs. 850 generated without any extra service why extra charge ????
good service we'll boy
Excellent service provided through professional Venkatesh
Worst experience the customer care person do not solve customers problems they do not care about the customers except business and money our washing machine was making noise so we booked from from UC for the same . For few days washing machine showed satisfactory response and after few days it started developing noise we reached the person since washing machine part was under warranty till 4th November.we even paid him an amount of 6500rupees wanted to elaborate more but the word limit .
excellent
Regular preventive maintenance was done by UC service executive for my one year used Geyser and the technician broke a part from geyser, i complained the same to UC, they said if any problem arrives they will arrange an revisit. But after one and half month geyser started leaking. And surprisingly UC customer service executive says that their service warranty stands only for 30 days. These guys only mind their money, they dont care about customer satisfaction.
App is slow although it is very useful.
very good work
Waste appppp
Such bad services they provide,they do have opened the app,but they don't have beautician to provide for services, even though I have booked it 2days prior they made me wait for a whole day,and end up saying no beautician
I book sofa cleaning in 3 times there is no professional assigned me worst service
Good
Excellent pest control service..Writing this review after a year..living peacefully with cockroach free..
Hello sir, Aap urban company ko gandhidham( gujrat) suru krdo taki hum loko ko bhi online kaam mil jaye
Services are user friendly
I added few services in cart, but when I want to check finally before payment I couldn't find them. As the app only save last added service. How foolish is that. If I have quite a few services to be done ofcourse I would like to do it in one day, but there is no option as such.
quick and excellent service..
Unable to book free ro service for which I had paid an yearly subscription 8n Aug 2021, no option are there. I also tried to connect with their customer care but no option provided.
How to customer care??? You guys have made it so difficult
Super service on time delivery üëç
Very good service
Microwave service excellent
I'm using this app for 5 years. Good application for time savers..!! Specially Salon, best for ladies bcz its comfortable at home and everything. Thank you Urban company for providing a good services.
Perfect place for a one stop solution for home cleaning.
Fraudulent practices. It might be a good business model. But it's just another platform where the customers are exploited. Their aim is to provide services, no questions asked but their aim is also to subtly add work and increase the final cost. I truested the brand, but I ended up spending a bomb on uninstallation and installation of my split AC. They broke my copper bike, intentionally leaked the gas so that while installing I will have to refill. Also blame it back on the customer. Pathetic.
Very Good Service
very worst and high prices on everything
Nice work
A professional took all the belongings and despite complaints on phone calls and on official app, the urban company did not reslove the issue and despite repeated reminders they did not acknowledge and didn't care enough to take any action against the assigned beautician
Excellent service from urban company.
Unprofessional service Provider who just ruined the whole plan and declined to provide services
Received services at kanpur. The professional was well behaved and did his job well.
Very bad...today for the first time I wanted to try it...and I'm not able make payment...it directed to payment page and it's the end white blank page....
Last minute cancellation!! I had to follow up with the team for the cancellation. When I called the cleaner assigned to me she says it is her weekly off - day !! Very bad experience. I have done all the prep work and last minute cancellation means I will end up doing the whole job !!
well service done by Mr ramu
very good and professional service .
Worst app they are not also giving a call if they cant arrange an service partner,making us to wait for call,had booked an service partner yesterday he has suppod to come by 7.30pm i didnt get the contact details till 7.30pm getting an call fillnally frm UB at 8.40 telling that sorry ...lol i dont need sorry i ned an service mam
Fake commitment. I have booked UC last week for my 3 bath rooms and the person came ro clean,there he used Acid to clean my taps due to that my bathroom taps got damaged and looking in very bad condition as the taps were of Hindware brand which were installed just 4 months back brand new one's. Really disgusting to use or recommend UC to others. Later i have raised issue and complained and shared pics too but after that no person called or responded back and today is the last day for warranty.
I got denied service for 2 days straight and then the request was automatically cancelled saying book a new one. Are you guys seriously running business or a joke
disappointed service offered by urban clap. Horrible
The plumber was very professional. Reported on time and immediately started the work. Showing his expertise, the problem we have been living with for the last few months, was rectified within minutes. Fully satisfied with the service rendered and I would recommend this app to all my friends.
Worst hair cut done by the professional
Worst.
Taking long time for refunding than expected. This is not appreciated
Forge company..mthey charge you and don't even fouve you service..you will just wait because of them and they don't have any resolution...never trust this company
Doesnt load anything after selecting time and date.
Hi I just used urban company spare parts changes all filters I changed from urban company for my Eureka forbes purifier after changing from that day only I am getting issues with water quality not getting support from urban company
üëçüëçüëç Excellent work
In app it is showing 200 rs cashback for payments made above 500 trough Paytmwallet.But it is not showing at the final payment. I tried contacting customer care, they have given worst ever suggestion that I had to contact paytm for cashback. Wosrt experience from Urban company helping service
Increased prices so much for salon. And for other services like plumber/electrition booking we have to pay an advance which is nonrefundable. What nonsense
Very bad. No solution and they charged me without services. Incompetent service professionals
The work done is very bad. The promises they made while taking contract will not be fullfilled on time. They take the contract for granted and not fullfilled the requirement of customers properly. Very disappointed with urban company.
Extremely slow app, takes ages to change payment method, complete payment etc
The rates for the changed spare part is too high. The thermostat for a single door fridge is changed with a charge of 800. 300 rs Thermostats cost is 800 rs here. You will get 90 days service warranty. Spare part charges seems too high. The service person did excellent job.
Wow
Very Good idea app.Please market your app.The users will increase largely
Awesome
Excellent professional cleaning üëå
excellent
the customer ratings even if below 3 they show it in GREEN color just to misguide customers using the app so that we won't notice average or below average reviews.
urban company service is good but price should be reduced little bit so it is helpful to get more people home service during china virus
Plz have a customer care for immediate assistance
very good
very satisfying
Worst company ever. They say we have professionals but in reality roadside ppl with minimum training are picked up and on beauty services gone wrong they promise redo of service but when try to book service they say ur timeframe is over. What do u expect? Person needs to have atleast 45days bw waxing but no their ppl say we cnt don anything
Worst service and I don't have an option for 0 star. So I have selected 1
It's nice to have salon services at home with all safety measures. It's safe, affordable and convenient. I liked it and recommend to all.
I m regular customer of urban company. Every time I satisfied but this time i feel they have taken more money in service of my washing machine part and service. Will never again go for machine service with urban company.
Is there any customer service number
No response from urban company
Good
Never keep there refund CB benefits duets customer
all other services are good but this time I called a plumber for my washing Machine repair as the machine was not holding its water the technician arrived as usual named kailash gurjar and repaired but after one day the previous problem again starts and I called him privately first for the revisit but he didn't come for two days , on the third day I booked revisit from the app but again he didn't come ,on the fourth day he arrived and then said " Ma'am your washing machine motor has gone dead"
Nothing is as good as it was in beginning. No one is doing a good service. It is happening more of olx which has unwanted sales persons
Good and swift..üëç
Very useful app
I availed their chimney cleaning service. Due to excessive use of cleaning chemicals, chimney's adhesives which holds the glass and metal worn out and the chimney broke. Raised a complaint on Nov 16(after very poor response from customer service)and they promised to pay the repair cost(after so many request for callback). I submitted the bill but no response till now. We cant track the history of conversation for complaints. No transparency. Poor app design. Warranty claim option - eyewash.
Tried UC for the first time. Professional first delayed then did not show up. UC arbitrarily scheduled for next day without informing. Also made the mistake of taking their annual package which they now refuse to reimbuirse citing policy. Non professional and non customer oriented approach.
I am unable to rebook the same professional for the service. I do not get the option itself and there is no support team as well to whom i can reach out for help
I booked an electrician at 11a.m. I've been trying to call since 11a.m. it's been 1.5 hours since registering a call back and nonresponse from customer service or the professional. Asked for help on the service. Makes you wonder if the SOS onnthe app even works. Makes you doubt your safety. I'm sitting here with nothing resolved and the only option is to reschedule after wasting my day. With ME having to pay to reschedule. This is a SCAM. All you had to do was communicate that the partner can't
I booked a service at a particular time and without even information UC rescheduled my appointment to a different time slot. The person who called and said that they will come for service has cancelled without any information.
Worst experiance ever..the professional first gave false time to reach and then the SOS is not picking up the call ..AND THEN I GOT MESSAGE THAT THE PROFESSIONAL HAS DENIED THE SERVICE SPOILLED MY ENTIRE DAY
V bad service
Chuteya aap ha
good
Recently i have seen that customers are rated in the app under your profile. I think this is not acceptable as this the first time service company is rating its customers. The company is run based on customers. Company is not available during its service and just by some comments of technicians you are rating customers is not acceptable.
I got a uc reward rs 300 but when I try to use the money in any service it's not added. The big problem we can't contact with them so easily...still I tried and one person call me back.He told me within 24 hours the amount of 300 uc will reflect in your wallet and within 365 days you can use it.Such a lier I even seen...nothing was happen...why the company people also try to make customers fool I don't understand...I am Really very disappointed.
Good and quick service
The executive denied service of stand fan. But I had taken same service of fan last october as well as the company clearly not show about the fan they are not provide service about the specific fan it's pathetic..in that matter I had transfer full amount and after assigned someone if no service happening 50% charge taken in my amount..very rediculus...bad experience with Urban clap...
It's not as good as it used to be. It's now just a money making service. Horrible experiences in the past couple of services.
Ansumwi narzary did a very good pedicure, manicure, underarms waxing and threading. She should learn to give more pressure during massage. Shailaja did excellent hair cutting job.
please decrease the costs
good
Excellent service. Liked the concept hazel free with home comforts.
It was august 2021, we thought of trying urban company for painting services. A decision i repent till date with this shabby company. If google had a provision of putting pictures, i would have shared them. They are bunch of cheats. The painter cum partner duped us , stole paints, ruined my entire house with shabbiest work. Never reccommend this to my enemy. Beware of these cheats. They broke pipes caused immense torture to us.. They are frauds! A big no!
Charged twice, no refund, no customer support.
Nice work
Manager other passion Vishnu old manager other manager site telling Vishnu satisfied passion only working
Please I request everyone not to use urban company especially for salon service..it's simply looting money from common man.. everytime I book for premium salon service but instead of premium service I didn't receive a professional service..all beauticians are untrained and very unprofessional.
I had a bad experience today. I had mentioned here in the afternoon. Surprising part is- its still not resolved. Urban company is not interested to resolve.
The boys were very patient and covered every inch of their work. excellant job done. Sparkely clean.
Very good app and service.
Excellent
Trying to get ro installation done service getting re-schedule every time, need to return ro now after wasting 5days.
It's full postpaid service and not allocating preferable slot to the customer
Not satisfied with urban company,yesterday they have replaced my whirlpool cooling fan motor spare part,it is look like lo al brand packed in whirlpool cover.When I raised same concern with the guy no answer from him. They are charging huge price for simple part repair where you can buy new spare with that price.
service requested for home cleaning was not satisfactory not recommended and unnecessarily expensive
excellent
Horrible professional just waste of time
I have been trying to book a classic facial and bleach since last week but it would not take the booking no matter what I do...I have a discount coupon which will expire. I do not understand if you are not willing to give services then why do you all say so!!!
Very good service provider. Good, and experienced machenic.
( All our professionals are busy. Please try after some time. ) Why are you cheating. You will not come even if you pay the fee.
Thanks again. Superb service.
I m satishfyied
as per cost I'm eating two stars otherwise all good and satisfied with service
Cancellations with 10 mins notice.
perfect
Today I facing problem due to service person , he will not attend the work , simply he told me cancel the booking or reschedule ,
very nice and good behaviour & politeness
most reliable
Very professional &Competent staff members.
nothing special to mention
Everything is Fine & Excellent.
Excellent work
lack of a dedicated customer care number or email keeps the customer issues unresolved. its been more than a month i raised an issue which is still un- resolved.
excellent service
video consultation service is amazing, really help full. identified and fixed the issue very efficiently.
The app should be able to allow the customer to call the support. There's no way via app to contact them
Charges are bit expensive
Excellent service...üëèno more words to describe it..Thankyou to the urban company..üòçüòçüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
Hi, I have booked a complete house cleaning package from URBAN CLAP. They have confirmed the booking but after waiting for more than 5 hours, they havent alloted any person for the activity. Tried calling several times to the help center but no response from their end. Not expected such things from the URBAN CLAP.
Nice
Sometimes service is cancelled.. But when given it is good service
Very good trained technician...good job....
PATHETIC...I was very much interested in taking my 1st appointment here, but the experience is awful. After selecting my package and everything while checking out they will let you know that their hands are full on Sundays...I mean are you even serious??? Most of the people have holidays on Sunday so ofcourse we will look for services on Sundays only right?? Seems that they are not interested in customers!!!!
Very Bad Service
very professional and did a good job
Not able to make payment online. I used promo code and tried to make payment online but unable to do it as it is showing error everytime. It is accepting cash after service only. Kindly resolve the issue
I have taken services from this app in the past and it was pretty good .But after its new update I am unable to book my services at all.I want to pay after the service and it's not accepting my request .Worst app.
Excellent
Good Service
great experience
nice co
I booked for haircut yesterday but then they won't able to book any professional for me. They rescheduled it for 12:30 PM and again same problem they are not able to book any professional for me.
Worst app bokka
Unable to book massage for men, while I keep getting ads
good work
Very good experiences
Services are not clearly specified and the prices are very high compared to type of work ...
Booked carpenter Jaiprakash ran away with ‚Çπ2000 advance. But UC refunded it for after complaining to customer care .Thank you Urban company for the needful.
superb service am really happy with the service
Thank you for the services.
coupon is not working
very poor service, even on my first booking none of person arrived nor anyone picked phone or even I received callback. I lostmy several hours of my weekend just waiting fortheir professional to come.
Best experience
very nice app and great experience with urban company
Excellent service
good service for working girls
good and supportive
very good app to get repair our machines
Not professional they dont do service on time and cancel the bookings blindly
Best option
Could get services at a very short notice and very safe service. But App us giving a lot of problems!!
location is not working. address is updated but still sending professional to my old location.
Services are
Their professionals keep on rescheduling the request and at times don't show up and cancel the request without informing the client
prompt efficient courteous service.
Search doesn't work, menus are missing.
Very coslty service and spare parts price are almost tripple
Looting money application.
Great service
Booked premium bathroom cleaning service, stains largely remained same. Cleaner seems untrained and never used any electrical brush as shown on ads. Regular prodeasional are far better.
I have recently booked home cleanung service, but its not worthy , i would suggest go for other service provider
professional service
UC, should respect to customer time and money, which I don't think .Contact number of professional is nt valid, they say professional ,they will ask schedule time and date, after that they wn't turnout. I was keep calling and no response from professional. No customer care is available on sunday. They just give adds in Tv. I wish I can give zero rating. It's just waste of time and money. Trust me, try to contact local professional for your needs rathere than this apps. Worst experience.
3 times I booked and they didn't show up after I paid! Never using this service again. They also added this hidden partner welfare fee that they did not inform us about. It's already very expensive.
It's a hassle free service being at home
Very bad services I booked a service at 7am. At 6 45 when I called my assigned professional she was sleeping and said can't come she moved my appointment to next day I don't how they can reschedule bit without client approval. I rescheduled it to 10:30am at 10 55 she calls me and says I m on my way n then reschedules it to evening again without my consent like we have only one job to wait for Urban Clap employees
App is becoming useless. Technical failures are increasing. It takes forever to load. Online payment throws error. Most importantly there is no human to talk to resolve issues.
Utterly disappointed and extremely unprofessional is urban company who doesnot respect anyones time and takes them for granted....the professional as promised doesn't make it on time and the company gives no heads up on the professional is coming or not. Is this the way services are provided?This is very unprofessional and moreover disrespectful. Its the second time the appointment is not kept and moreover the company doesn't have a simplecourtesy of informing prior yet alone a replacement.Shame
Very good service
They have no control over their professionals and managers does not know how to talk to a customer. Pathetic recent experience by Urban company.
I have been an UC user for the past 3 years . Have used them across cities ( Mumbai Bangalore Hyderabad & Chennai) . Superb processes ensure an uniform service quality . Excellent training to Partners . It's a WOW ! Idea .
very nice , would highly recommend
The app is pathetic i am trying to book a slot since yesterday its not allowing me to select date or time for appointment and redirecting me with an error stating we dont have professional right now to serve you.
The app is easy to use and the services are also great.
The technician charged me extra for an early morning visit. And then didn't even show up. We have been contacting the guy since 745 am and it is 915 am right now. Noone from the company has called us and we can not get through the company at all.
Most bitter experience with this app and the professional being allotted for service. Got Irritated when they don't even attempt to do the service. Better do it by yourself or call up the traditional local professional instead of believing these PROFESSIONALS (naming themselves). They are doing irrelevant and obbsessive ads and don't belive with those deceiving ads
App is good only problem. Job Card details missing what sevice we booked.. it simply saying bathroom and kitchen cleans multiple mini service added also. Overall service experience. 3.5 rating we can give..
They have good professionals with them, but they keep changing their processes and there is no customer service. Since last 2 years I have been getting my body spa done through Babita, but all of a sudden they changed their rules and now I am unable to use her services. This is so wrong, I will not use this app for spa services anymore, and there is no customer service also, you have no one you can speak to and only reply on automated responses
Simply taking bookings for service and not arriving. Its 100% waste of time... waste company
Every time it is showing no professional available. When it is Urban clap, there are more professionals available.. But now with less professionals they are managing it seems
good response..
Very good
I repaired my washing machine and they gave warranty of 90 days and after 102 days my washing machine faced the same issue. They fitted the motor which lasts just for 102 days. This is all there service, so called business.
v good servicing. Came on time and clean the air cons with cares and took out the parts and wash and clean properly. Will engage him again for next servicing
They are urging customers to make online payments. What they are doing is very wrong.... We cancel faces only because we do not have time. But these people appear to us to pay only online to cancel us. What do we have only cash. I will pay only after payment. What to do for this so I forgot to use this application I can't book next time it is so wrong. I don't like to pay not online payment because they are not refund very worst company üò°üò°üò°üò°
Urban company is quite dependable
Rajeshwari was excellent in her job. will definitely recommend her
Very very very bad app
what's wrong with the application?? I can't proceed with the booking. it freeze
Excellent service. They have made life so easy. Very professional and affordable services.
Every time I get a better professional who are very professional and good at work.But last time was exceptional.She was very curious about our family matters.Her service was extremely bad though forced me to give 5 star. This was my worst experience. Extremely bad pedicure and manicure and did not follow any instructions. I repeatedly told her, there are still dead skin cells but she didn't bother to listen and not punctual at all.She also forced to take other services which I didn't booked for.
good service . clean everything
Total wastage of money , services are just shown not really provided
Excellent experience, recommend urban company to everyone
They keep rescheduling the appointment without any consent from the client.. waste of money and time as well since they work as per their convenience.. never choose pre-paid services.. they always mess up with it..
nice n excellent service
best
No one in customer service calls, I bought appliances insurance, there is no option to raise request for repair
Really bad service & insane charges üòû
I am satisfied
I was once upon a time a great fan of this urban clap app and used to book all services - Had a horrible experience with salon at home booking today - Decided to no longer rely on this urban company any longer for services ! No customer care number to respond on time
Excellent service .stain was removed completely.
My slot was for 4 pm,I was 2 leave home at 6 pm which was well informed to the beautician beforehand previous day as she was to pay visit twice for both days occasion. But she arrived at 6pm.I had no chance to reschedule.She was constantly telling lies tht she wld reach in 5 mins over more than 10 times having called her over phone. I was so helpless that i had to unwillingly forced to wait for your beautician to come and provide the services. Beware of Supriya Shaw. Looting the company.
Good application.
Quick service and professional knowledgeable technicians.
excellent
Very ba experience
Urban Company app is good easy to use . sarvice good and safe very useful I like and recommend Urban Company app
Bad experience
Good work
Pathetic service
Worst service executives
Excellent and good job.
very good plateform to done job easily and on convenient time
Earlier they were better now a days they don't solve any issues we are very disappointed with their customer support system but professional are very good.
Very good
good service
Good
There is no proper customer care number to enquire on the services to choose or customisation, the app is also not user friendly.
I am very happy with the services
Cleaner denied service.. wasted my time simply waiting for him
Wrong facial kit brought....
Hair colour application was not appropriate. All white hair were visible and when we told her about it no action was taken. The professional didn't not know how to use thread for upperlip and eyebrows. Cleanup and wax services were fine.
There is no option to adjust UC Cash during service payment. No easy option to talk to customer care.
The app experience is great but what the hell with slyly enforcing a membership charge on people. Cheap sales & marketing.
professional and polite servicing
This is froad company
Unable to see luxury category anymore.
No customer support, re scheduling service without any consent of the customer.
Great service , recommend.I will call next time too. Thanks
thanks UC
Provide a correct checklist in the app so that people will know what they are opting for and do not get fooled seeing all fake advertising of what they are truly getting. Paid for highest service and did not even receive basic service and top of all fake promises from supporting team.
Pathetic service, very unprofessional. Urban company sucks
Not gud
Reschedules service on their own without consulting customer. In App there's no way to connect to their customer care. Just a bunch of options to click and click!!!
excellent workers..
komal is exceptionally not only good but also professional,cordial, and a perfect beautician
Good
Superb service
It used to be q very good servicing app, but not now. From last 2 times i qm booking my services paying in advance but no professional got assigned at time and they canceled the appointment. There is no benefit for UC plus membership also.
Fraud hain
Easy booking, prompt service, great technician. Had issues with the app hanging constantly for a while but that seems to have been resolved now.
Started charging higher, rather use other cleaning apps
Useful app
The assigned professional cancelled the booking a few hours before my function, the message I received was that I cancelled the booking?! Moreover I try rebooking and only male professionals keep getting assigned. I request a call back and nothing. What sort of a service are you providing exactly? Oh wow, now I got a cancellation fee of 50/- too! Getting better!
Bad experience with the house painting service. Work was incomplete as none of the ceilings were painted. Urban Company has refused to refund me for the incomplete portion of the work despite the fact that their team member came and saw the flat and agreed that it was incomplete.
Slow, glitchy, incomplete. The app notified me about the payment needed but did not let me pay. I paid the professional directly but it still shows "payment pending" on the app. The in-app support doesn't help nor does it have a chat feature for such issues.
Excellent
Dear Friends, I would urge people out there to try out the Parlour Service offered by UC. They have Premium, Classic and Luxury to fit into every pocket. Their representatives are thoroughly professional and hygiene measures are class apart. Getting something like this from the comfort of your home is worth every penny spent. I was lucky to get a representative like Sonam who was exceptionally well in her service and had good knowledge of her work. Thanks üëçüòäüôè
NO ANY IN MANY AREAS LIKE: SHAMLI
Urban clap can you PLEASE fix whatever glitch it is that prevents me from making a payment to finalise my booking. At first I thought it was a system glitch but its been 3 days already.
Failed to provide beautician professional after promise.
Very unreliable services. Your professional could not return on job although he promise to come back by 5 o clock. He told that he has other booking and he will complete tomorrow. I told him ye galat hai. I lodge complaint on app. Your first customer executive told you can cancel your booking your whole amount will be refunded. I told him ok. But the mental tourcher which I had can not be compensated. I checked my account no refund. Next your second executive told me that 299 has been deducted.
good
Had two different services in 2days and both are well Profesionate. But cost looks more expensive
I opted for premium salon services. The beautician burnt my whole arm with hot wax. Now going to doc. Where to complain? I want my refund and medical bills paid. There is no number available.
Plz send more experienced personnels
good service and good company
Good experience
Very silly App. Does not have a shopping cart. Adding multiple services is an issue, everytime the back button is used choices dissappear.
Using this app for the very first time n m super happy ü§óü§ó Thanks Urban Company
very good work osm service.... I m so happy
Bad. People providing service are not trained.
Please improve your app and system. You are into service oriented biz and any glitches in the prices will demotivate to use your app. Make sure the prices are transparent because the engineers / technicians do not know how to use the app. Handle this section with care.
Respectful towards elders. Dedicated to work.
very bad experience
I had leaking kitchen pipes and an Urban plumber came. He looked at the problem, promised to return the next day and collected his payment. But this sly young guy never returned. Why should he? He got paid for doing nothing.
BEWARE OF THE PAINT JOB. PLEASE DONT TRUST THE PAINT SURVEYOR AND READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY: the T&C WILL HAUNT YOU BACK. My experience: Gave 40k for 3bhk (7-10days) job including waterproofing. UC took 1.5 months, 2 contractors to finish the job. My wooden flooring of 2 rooms was completely damaged and repair estimate came at around 18K. UC told that "As per Policy", we can only pay 10K so i had to bear the loss of additional 8K. UC gave warranty of paint job, but after 1 week of paint job, seepage occured even in places where it wasnt there earlier . UC replied that "As per policy", they cannot do anything abt it. In short, my horror experience story had following outcomes: 1. Harassment approx 2 months since we are living in the same place and got adjusted in different rooms multiple times. 2. Unnecessary loss of 8K purely because of unprofessional service by UC. 3. unnecessary follow ups and head banging with UC executives over call and emails. 4. big patches and discoloration due to seepage even after taking the water proofing and luxury paint job ( that too on the advice and promise of UC surveyor). 5. Rudeness of UC executives when i told them that you already gave me a loss of 8k, and you should see how the paint job done bad can be corrected. PLEASE DO NOT TRUST UC EXECUTIVES(PAINT SURVEYORS) , THEY CAN MAKE ALL THE FALSE PROMISES IN THE WORLD JUST TO GET THE SALE AND THEY TAKE MONEY IN ADVANCE SO THAT YOU GET ON THE BACKFOOT THROUGHOUT THE JOB AND HAVE VERY LITTLE/NO OPTION TO SAVE YOURSELF. P.S- this is my second post regarding the poor service, also this can be deleted at anytime by UC, BUT BEWARE.
Extremely skilled professionals. Thank you Urban Company.
Prompt timings good behaviour service. Perfect
worse app ever dont like his customer helpline service an instemate prosseseing...
application speed slow, sometimes keep loading
showing discount but not deducting discount on our total amount as UC customer care executive says its subscription fees and not given to customer as discount, only showing discount but they do not pay or deduct from total amount payable.
v good and professional
Very Good
One of the worst company in the world, very bad experience to served from your organization, who once take the electronics items for repair they never bring it back. Let come your profession , I will teach him a lesson . A lot of requests happened with you guys..It's too late.
Not good
thank you
Absolutely shoddy app. No customer service. Assigns not-preferred professionals and then charges cancellation. Does not allow pay later facility. No way to contact customer service. Quite awful.
Superb
I had reviewed about the unsatisfactory service a few days back and sure enough the review has been deleted by the company. Only a shady company would resort to such measures to project a good image.
üí© App, they have adress of my city but ,they can't come.I think That you came to only smart and popular cities only. My adress is VVnagar, Anand, Gujarat-388120. Also take servise on my city.My neibour also what salon at Anand.
Need to followup with ttechnician multiple times. They simply say you are not reachable and the app takes payment first. Not useful and reliable.
unsatisfactory work
Today i booked my facial services and paid full amount in advance. And from morning two beautician assigned but unprofessionally nobody having with correct products which particular services i booked. and now they are offering other product which cost more. So, before assigning beautician kindly check they have correct products or not. Don't select them blindly. This types of unproffessional activities are not welcomed.
The app us unusable since I upgraded to android 12 on my pixel 4a 5g. It freezes and then shows system ui crash error.
No stars at all..its really pathetic application .the professionals burnt your hand but there is no customer support for the same .i mailed them many times but no one even reply Do not waste your time on this app it's pathetic.
I signed up , but haven't received any cash back from them
Very Good Express
Don't ever book any Mechanical repair service from them, over the phone they will say yes We can repair your appliances but when they came and check they will say you won't be able to do this call company and they will charge you for just showing their idiotic face. Dont Book any service from them.
Good
Nice person, Good work
Hello, I am trying to call on the no. provided for grievances because there is no other no to call. Nobody picks up the phone. Its so frustating. How do you expect your customers tobe happy with the service if you guys are not reachable.
Here professionals try to retrieve more money than stated in the app. Customer has to be smart to tackle such people. Theives!
This company really went down hill recently with their customer service. I've been a loyal customer and member for over a year and the last 3 bookings were canceled due to the professionals not having valid ID's. And whats worst is that they call 15 mins before the scheduled appointment! An absolute waste of time! I hope the authorities investigate them further. This has been the 15th time they cancelled the service without prior notice. Seems that all the professionals are illegal without ID.
Good service..always
Created a system where they cant resolve issues at their end and neither its possible to resolve issue at customer end. Good for nothing lawyers in this country. Only knows how to generate red tape.
Good experience
I have a wonderful experience with Urban company..they are very professional and best what they do.
Tried 3 different times to schedule a slot and was not successful.
i took electeician for my home before diwali 2021. its been 2 months. electrician left service incomplete and took full payment. all executive just call me or missed call me and not solved issue. never go with urban company. they only make u full.
I booked deep cleaning service from urban company. I was out, so had handed over the keys at security. When we returned, UC professionals were sitting and having food. They didn't use any chemicals for cleaning. Colin was the only chemical used. Windows were not cleaned, tables were not cleaned. Washrooms cleaning was done in 5 min. Overall service said it will take 3-4 hours. These people started at 2 pm and completed at 3 pm. Waste of money. They were not leaving the house till we gave 5 star
Really unhappy with the customer care support. I have tried reaching them a lot but all in vain. Still no contact number to reach the support
Gd experience but plz add pet grooming service. Badly needed
My work is pending about 1 months although I paid full amount. Surveyer joajit chattopadhya and supervisor sandip Paul jointly cheated me .they also took ‚Çπ3000 . I am frustrated by behavior. Your customer support Ankita.jubin,suhashini and abhinandan they call me and promises your probelm would be solve but invain. I say to company return my money paid immediately so I can complete my painding work.your technician sushant mistri visited side on 02/12/2021. and saw all.
Excellent service, well behaved and highly skilled professionals.
But for once when the technician was delayed beyond acceptable limits the, app, the service and charges are satisfactory.
Not able to book massage service... The payment page does not load up only... Too many glitches in the app....
Extremely professional, coordinating and polite working team of Vikram Pawar. They cleaned each and every corner of the house thoroughly and left it shining. Very happy and satisfied with the complete service.
Worst user experience of app, adding to cart is not being saved when I try to select the services from other categories
Cost of my life is only 800/= reimbursed as told by Urbanclap. I booked a kitchen cleaning service and had a unsatisfactory and unsafe job experience. The cleaner broke gas connector and hid pipe under stove. Fully unaware I went to kitchen lighted gas. the gas knob was off and when opened had full gas leakage. Had the gas knob been open, it would have resulted in a blast and death on spot. on reporting UC contacted the cleaner who denied charges and UC closed my case with 800 reimbursement.
Urban didn't served service in Jamnagar Gujarat Location.
Excellent service....
Not good for beauty n salon each of professional are different and service they give is also different something or other is always missing in their tools .for salon going to the parlour is much better than Urban clap.
Good app and good.service product, good work
excellent job and good service üëè
Excellent experience. Partners are also very professional...
2 times I booked and 2 times booking cancelled. Their worthless sorry is nothing. Its a time waste don't trust them
Good and fast service
Recently I have repaired LG TV. There was an issue with LED strips. The LED strips price as per rate card INR 600/strip. But they took almost double. And not given proper invoice too. Even don't mentioned replaced spare in the invoice, just mentioned adjustment costs. Not recommend cause they are charging more. Intresting thing is that I am not able to pay all kind of online payment with proper network.
Good service provided...
very neat and good service provided
clean and neat work. behaved politely
the app needs better interaction option and customisation
Urban is from
Nice job üëçüèª keep doing as same standards

It's awesome and excellent

Excellent
I m pay 229 rs. Iss baat ke liye ki aap apni TV kisi macanic ko dikha ke theek kara lo .
No customer service. Just an email 8d is not good enough
Very worst ...........Hesitating to give single star also ........I booked a carpenter my timing was 1 30 but till nw no one is responding ......Please don't use dis app just they are doing scam
Total thieves. A guy came for painting consultation. Took advance from us in name of Urban Company and ran away. Now Urban Company says that the employee was a fraud and ran away with money. We can't take responsibility for that. Such big thieves these people are. Never go for painting service with them. Even if you open tickets, they will close them from their end. They won't take any responsibility.
Very professional cleaning service
Very helpful timely response way to go... Thanks üëçüòä
I like Neeta Raut work.she is perfect
Awesome
Quite expensive cleaning service; they came up with new policy of welfare fee billed to the client without prior information and consent; cleaners are not up to the mark hence onus of paying them more should be reserved not mandatory. Not using this app again for their hidden charges
no toll free helpline bad
I'm giving a 2 star not for the services rendered but the way the app messes up if you have more than one address saved in your address folder. In my case it picked up 2 addresses with 2 different pin codes thereby alocating the services to professionals in wrong areas. It happened twice in a single day and the services had to be canceled and refund initiated!!!
Best beauty app
Excellent Services provided by UC, thanks for all your understanding and provided Excellent services
App is not allowing to book services. After selecting the service, date and time slot app is getting stuck at payments. Please resolve the issue as early as possible.
They are not able to provide ro repair, electrician and carpentry services to our apartment despite the fact that it is a prominent part of Bangalore city and beaty parlour services and AC repair services are being provided. It appears that there's some issue between UC management and the service technicians
customer care phone number is unavailable
Good
Very poor experience
90% of the time UC can't keep a booking even to within an hour. I schedule a weekly at home pcr test and it's usually over an hour late. I scheduled a massage for my SO and it's booking is over an hour late with no answer from the company. If you need something done on time schedule it at an institute. If you're home all day and have time to kill, use urban company because eventually within 6 hours of your booking someone might make their way to you.
3rd class customer support team
Best services at home with good hygiene and sanitized equipment. Well behaved staff.
Very nice service at affordable price.they take all the safety measure in this pandemic that's the best part of them.
Excellent professional work.
simple and easy
There is no customer care to solve any issues we face. No body is replying on the urban company whatsapp account too. Feels helpless. Even I can't choose the professional on my own as list is not visible. Plz make some upgrades in ur app. We should be able to see all professionals who r available to serve me for my area. Service is also not like how it used to be previous. The quality is deteriorating. Plz maintain quality to keep clients happy and worth to pay u.
Started out well but has UC has become really expensive. There are always technical glitches while making payments. Money gets debited but the payment shows as outstanding. Then the inform you that if money was deducted, it will be refunded after 5 days. What sort of nonsense is this?
Service is great but price is too too high
A fascist company that forced all their employees to be vaccinated regardless if the recovered from covid or not . Choice is never selfish. Especially since it is totally a voulantry process legally by the country and the health system supported by the courts
To fix 4 screws for tv installation this idiots charged 500 rs. Pathetic service.
I booked Urban Company for the first time. I liked the service.
Why did you delete my comment... Worst customer service and worst app... Cheating people for money... Here's the original comment "Worst customer service... They spoiled my AC and now no one is taking responsibility"
This company works very bad. Advertising best but works is very bad and staff behavior bad losses money is company works
excellent and prompt service
Cheaters
Never use salon services, untrained staff. Very bad experience.
I m so much happy with UC You keep offers you will get more customers ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Very slow app...there service is good...but the app is too slow
Good
Useless app
The latest update is not letting me even login. All I get is " You cannot view this. Try log in again". Is something wrong. It was working fine until few days back
Very professional service
Farzi company.... looting us and fooling people. No one is assigned and my hard earned money is gone. Shameless creature
Good service
Ripping people off their money has become BAU for this platform.
Not responding
Poor experience
Very unprofessional company they don't show on the scheduled time and they dont even bother informing make sure particularly you don't book a lady called Nadia
Nice service
Dhokebaj fraud company
Not even represent my location, in that says that serving the other nations. What a joke? First serve the India nation in all the PAN India locations then serve the other nations
Although I have previously enjoyed availing your services, I think your forced vaccination policy is a disgusting infringement of human rights. Your employees are not owned by you. They have a right to medical freedom, and the fact that you perpetuate this blatant bullying as a company is revolting. I will make sure to stop using your services and ask all my friends to do the same until you stop defining your staff by their vaccination status.
For the first time I have used UC nd it was hell worst, assistant is not assigned till last min nd my slot has been gone, I have paid money alredy, neither there is call from customer support nor the no. Has been provided so customer can call them, I literally don't know anything about my money how to get it! Very poor service, advise for UC don't accpet it if you can't complete it
good
Good service
very professional and we'll trained
Best service
Very very poor service by urban company. The professionals never arrive on time. There's no helpline number which you can call. I once waited for one and a half hour for the professional to arrive. I'm writing this email while waiting since past half an hour for the professional. I'll never use urban company from now on. Bonus: Their charges have increased a lot.
Very very very worst experience. Took the booking and canceled just 20 minutes before the time... wasted our entire time... No wonder 90% of the last 100 reviews are 1 star...
service was excellent
best place to find util services
Can't believe it was so easy to use the service. The best for house hold services.
Professional services. Polite staff. Reasonable charges.
perfect
Cannot manage address section
Worst experience with urban company
Namaskar, Shabana and Asma did wonderful job. Great ladies power. The team is so wonderful and trustworthy. I will certainly refer to my friends.
Worst experience ever! They keep rescheduling and cancelling services. The help centre only complicates the whole process. They first show one amount while booking and after technician comes and charges more without any valid reason! They just see their profit and not the customer satisfaction! Really sad!
For third class services at 5 star rates book Urban Company now! Benefits: 1. Book a slot as per your convenience so that their "professional" Suraj Kumar Mandal can reschedule your booking as per his own convenience without asking you! 2. Pay as much as 60% more than normal price for all consumables used during services. 3. Get charged from Rs. 50-100 more at payment page than the rates shown for each service before booking in app and get additonal cashback upto big "0" on making payments!
costly
No what it used to be. 3 stars only for the past professional services...2 redcuced for recent experience acrosa different service s
Good response
not fast
verry good
good üëç
Best experience
Highly expensive (pricing for cleaning stuff at homes) and strictly not recommended for moderate income families.
Very bad experience of payment there many hidden charges, no discount given to prime members, u can't pay through credit card or cred pay, u have to pay direct technician, no customer care call centre very difficult to solve your issue.
The checkout process is terrible. Despite resetting multiple times, the app just hangs during the payment.
Damaged my TV after taking deep cleaning. Pathetic post sales service. Top management does not care.
Worst service so far. Waste of time.better look fir another service .Will. are sure I never utilise this app and service ever again
The technicians are not at all professionals and knowledgeable. An idiot from urban company damaged my front load washing machine. Very pathetic and poor customer service following up from last 15 days the only answer they have is as nothing is mentioned we're not able to cater your request. If you are not able to cater the requests then why the hell you're running the app
nice
Thugs..they spoilt my television and their call center is hopeless
Horrible service. Salon booking re-scheduled last minute without any discussion. That too after a confirmation call an hour earlier. Extremely unprofessional service.
I have signed up using referral and I didn't get signing amount..there is customer support chat or service..so can't talk to any customer agent when required on booking any service..so many ads but no customer chat atleast.. unbelievable
Please do not use this people just scam you. I got my house painted and after 2 days the wall started peeling off they say waterproofing but it's just a big scam and white door when painted brown there were white patches left. It's worst it beeter to get painted by your local painters they will do good work than the people from urban clap.
High credibility.
good services
Good
the first professional canceled and was rude
One tap for all solution in a professional way
Pretty nifty service for our everyday needs. The agents are well trained and courteous and do the job well. The prices are also very reasonable. I have hired electrician, plumber, cleaner, beautician from them and everyone have done their job really well. Thank you Urban company. You deserve a 5.
It's a highly unprofessional site. Post booking their professional will cancel the service after accepting a day in advance. Entire day will go rescheduling keeping your self free according to their timing. In the end they will say sorry for inconvenience.
its very bad
Its the least I can give...else they dont deserve this either. They hire folks without doing any exp check. I hired a beautician for waxing, the lady burnt my face while doing upper lips....its pathetic. My scar is healing and it still has black marks after 15 days..so Girls out there if you love your face please dont book them.
customer care no. is not mentioned even sometime you show something in app and work is opposite to it
Too overpriced
Technician was professional, satisfied with his work but had to pay extra money because of urben company. App have option of only one type of simple dining table, it did not have option to select foldable dining table. As this is neither mine not technician's mistake, company should pay those extra charges which they said they can't. So atleast make you app more inclusive and add multiple options so these type of things won't happen again with customers.
Excellent app
azaz
perfect work, he well done explain the problem
Fantastic service and really worth the money, i will definitely be a regular customer with urban company, thank you and a special thanks to Nowmei for her patience and understanding , will repeat her for the next session. Lakshmi B N
very well satisfied with their work
Very difficult.. not cus friendly
This is not the 1st time I book a maid and they cancle very disappointing If u can't deliver a service dont accept it and make people wait
My fully paid active booking is deleted from booking section. Customer service asked me to book the same service again but the particular service is not available. Since i dont have that booking avaialable in the system, i cant opt for a call back as well now. You have made it so hard to reach the customer service.
good
Companies idea is good go provide required utility people, but the people who come should be checked of their worthiness to deliver the job to be done... Very bad experiences i have faced üôèüèª moreover you cannot get in touch with their customer care people at all
The Most useful App for daily life.
Tried for the first time..... excellent service
Great service and was on time.
Unable to book any service for Coimbatore location for past 1 week. Even with plus membership, dropped a mail to your customer care. Frustrating
UC could you please provide washing machine cleaning services. I don't see in the app. There is option for installation and set up but cleaning option is not available. Thank You ‚ò∫Ô∏è
life saver
App open once after downloading , thereafter it doesn't work.
Excellent
Poor
It never has any slot available
Urban company's service is bad and pest control for cockroaches doesn't get rid of them and the material used in it is also bad. Please be warned before buying service from this company. Professionals never arrive on time after booking a service. They don't answer our calls and the company doesn't do anything about it. The price is also very expensive, and the warranty is also useless. Overall it was a really bad experience. So again, pls be warned before buying service from this company.
I gave the reference to my friend and they have made my friend to reschedule the service two times and no one came to do the cleaning. The worst customer service experience he had today and it was my fault to refer this company to my friend.
They send only African maids to my house despite choosing other maids they replace them with Africans! All these ladies have the same problem, they use the bathroom cleaning cloth, brush, mop in other places of the house! I strictly give them instructions Not to use any bathroom cleaning cloth in the bedroom, kitchen but when no one is looking they completely ignore! Every African maid from their company has done the same thing I am really tired! I will boycott their service!
Not available in my city this is a very bad company
Excellent
Job done excellent by technician...
Opted for appliance protection plan a few weeks back and now trying to book a repair. Don't see any option to book directly, waiting for call back for more than a week.
So far so good. I have been enjoying my experience with UC.
Excellent, marvelous patient, dutiful team consisting Mr. Dhikambar, Mr. Sanjay, Mr. Fagu, Mr. Madan and Mr. Tipur
Best in class service provided by this company. All technicians and experts are well professional. Also companies policy is very strict and this helps the customers to get good and proper services.
Excellent service
Unable to book.The app keeps taking me in loops,as I struggle to fill in the address,even though I have used the services umpteen times.
Not used at all Hope ,I will do it later
Worst service
Cannot contact their customer care. Cannot book my preferred professional. It has become difficult to re-book. We are being forced to book professionals of their choice. More over no CC number where I can talk to. Very annoyed with this system.
Costly
Very pathetic services...I was told that I will receive 300 wallet cash because the beautician didn't arrive on time and spoiled my festival. I spoke with the Manager she said she will give compensation ...now they are charging me cancellation fees which I have not done. WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT!!!! I'M GOING TO UNINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND NEVER USE IT AGAIN!
will definitely recommend to other flat owners in our building
This service consists of two visits 12-13 days apart for pest control.During first visit insecticide is sprayed and in second visit gel is applied for longer effect. The sevice attendant was polite and attentive.
Good
Thank you
Very bad I paid and I got booking confirmation but no one came to do the work!!!! üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° At least show some respect to the customer and call to inform that no one is coming üò§üò§
I dont have the salon services in my area.. tried many times but there is no service. Even in Bangalore if you cant provide services in all areas.. then what is the use of keeping this application in my phone
Excellent
Excellent service
Upon booking 3bhk deep clean, there's disagreement from urban clap on charges paid. Customer care did not seem to be agreeing on charges shown in app or paid via app. Bad experience, wasted a lot of time and energy with no output.
The best app and best service , I uesd to call a local technician and he used to give excuses tried to extract large sums just for small repairs , I love the service keep up the good work.
Made our life easier.
Very convenient to use.
very good
Pathetic ridiculous garbage
Negative review from my side. This company is cheating customers. At the time of booking price is low and when service engineer reached,they increase the price. Also be aware they are charging more then the MRP of the parts. Cheaters cheaters and cheaters. I will sue you in court for charging more then the MRP.
Fantastic service at affordable prices
excellent Service
Unable to get proper response
Bakwas service
HASSLED SERVICES BY URBANCLAP....Waste of Money & Time on this app...Locals been hired (0) Rated services.No professionals just locals in urbanclap...Hassle services from urbanclap
Nisha excellent.
Worst experience. Paid for water leakage and color pilling whereas surveyor advised to get grouting done. This didnt resolved the leakage issue. After raising complain, company reverting this could not be fixed as water leakage is because of some other reason. My objection is when Urban's surveyor advised for grouting, does it mean he is not sure of the reason or are they making people fool?
Very bad customer service and app related issue. No payment link in app to make payment and your engineer is demanding payment by cash without this problem being fixed and without any invoice or receipt.
Excellent!
First and foremost u guys don't have a customer service number to be contacted.I needed some assistance before booking for the massage therapy but there was no option at all to contact you guys which is very irritating. Also I used ur sofa cleaning service few months back. Ur team used some very hard chemical for cleaning which made my sofa leather very rough and it started getting torn from all places.My 44k leather sofa is spoiled so bad that now we have to buy a new sofa. Overall disappointed
Unprofessional working
Worst company in terms of service. I ordered service for refrigerator clean up and that guy damaged my fridge. It is in non working condition since 10 days and no one has even responded.. consumables worth 6000rs gone bad. Recommend not to use this app , they are the worst service providers.. worst customer support.
Very bad in time management very very unhappy by service
Very high cost
Very.Good
Nice work and good job
great and fast service.
The professional will not be assigned to you on time . And at last min when you discover the same, you will have to keep trying to reach the help desk and at end of it they will say no one is available . So you waste your time , if its alredy paid for, money will be stuck for 7 days . And customer service sucks they will not do anything. App's user interface is missing useful prompts . Bad experience . UC has replied they shall reach me by call but they don't even have my contact .
very good
ok
Their service sucks and I regret having called them to service my borivali apt, they turn up at pune somehow owing to their GPS map. They don't refund my booking money stating I cancelled the service and as per policy I don't get my refund. If I had not canceled would the service been provided at borivali ??
Iam trying to get ikea furniture assembly service from 5 days and it's showing no service available in kalyan Mumbai,it's very bad that you cannot provide services for this area what about other small cities in India??
great service. ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê
Worst experience ever
Worst
Nice app
Thank god I didn't took membership,I paid totally 2439 out of that 1739 to urban clap +200 advance booking and extra 500 to technician I felt like looted ..any way it was a experience for me.
4.5 goodüòä
Very poor service and their customers care executive are extremely worse. Pathetic.
excellent
The professional don't give you back the expensive spare parts which are replaced. There are no customer care support, so be careful guys! They will force you to give 5 stars for their service.
Service was vary good
not worth staff not up to the mark Once a again a pathetic charges . Somehow feels like if customer do not check bill they will charge anything... new charges applied as sur charge and visiting charges... bloody cheaters just trying to fool the customer..
Very e service
Worse service ever
Good
I am happy with this app services, as it fullfill all the promises, resolve problem and upto mark delivers the job
Unprofessional people as simple as is. They cancelled my cleaning on the same day without getting back to me.i was forced to book another cleaner and when she called me she is terribly sick with running nose and dead voice and proposing to come clean my appartement during covid times.when i asked for a replacement no action is taken. It is completely non responsible to put people at risk just for the sake of earning money and this shall reach DHA to avoid non healthy behaviour from this company
Professionals are improving. But discounts are less . App works well ,but slow in poorly connected areas. Must introduce uc lite. Difficult to add walletpoints wHile making a check out in payment .

The executive was not qualified to clean the air purifier and he destroyed the HEPA filter. Now the company is not willing to pay me for that neither the company is replacing the filter. The support is of no use.
Ridiculous service, booked for Refrigerator service, slot booked at 3pm Monday 29th, Professional assigned Mohammed Umar Farooq but neither he is picking the call nor call back from Urban team regarding the status. Patectic... If we want to cancel the service there will b charges of 50rs for what good reason charge of 50rs if there has been no response from Urban...
Should be available in all the places
Debojith mondal who had come well trained good attitude on time, good job satisfied üëç üëè üëå
Costliest service is sofa cleaning
super service and plumbler tota Ramu is done good response with good service iam fully satisfied
Doesn't take bookings and still allows to io till last page and stop saying we don't have beauticians available
Good experience
Good service. Thorough cleaning to my expectation.
Good service but pricey
perfect service
They didn't assigned beautician on time... No contact number to reach out for help.
Discounts could be better
I have used home salon and body massage service of urban clap. Staff was very professional. They took care of hygiene very well. Body massage was relaxing and soothing. I would like to recommend them .
Totally wastage of time . don't use .. pagal banate h..
Availed the disinfectant service. But, for the record, I had spent 2300/- for availing the said service. Yet, I had to call out another disinfectant service as their professionals were very much disappointing. The last option for the next time if I need any such similar kind of service. Totally misleading what has been shown in the video.
To good
Wonderful app got my saloon at home comfort
Facing issue with Amazon pay wallet. Tried multiple time. Can you fix it.
Earlier it was fine,,but now when I am going to book for saloon services date selection option is. Not showing ..since last 1 week.howcome full week 24/7 all saloon services are booked
They just show service. Work in deliverables. Only prompt you to pay first but services and turn around time is pathetic. I will prefer a local vendor rather than using this useless app where the owners are not even paying attention to their client and business.
I have enjoyed the ease and simplicity of the app and the services provided by it.
Very big froud company
Good one
Very bad experience if these guys dont have professionals available then why they show slot is available.
Worst UI. Not able to checkout. It's magnified and not able to see any button for checkout.
Nice thanks for your servicessüôåüôåüôå
My professional not came for service 2 times and didn't get refund yet
bathroom cleaner service good
Worst service I ever experience even without touching the TV technician said not possible to resolve adviced to change tv or display, but tv is showing only 2 horizontal lines. I would not expect this kind of services. Very very bad.
Due to urban company mechanics, compressor is damanged and refrigerator company is now not ready to replace it, eventhough it is under warranty. Vey bad experience. Now I would require to get it repaired with my own expanses.
This was my first time rectifying something through video conferencing. Absolutely brilliant guidance! It was free too. If they were to visit me and repair something, they will charge me. That's obvious! Impressive service!
Good
I'm trying book and washing machine repair at nagpur but the location is selecting for UP State, useless this app and also the web site.
Salon person literally misbehaved with me. Never trust
There is no option to call customer service.really disappointed
Best option for salon services in this pandamic.
I have guests coming later tonight for a small gathering and I relied on this service for the cleaning. The scheduled time was to start 7pm and finish by 9pm. It is now 8:15 pm and still no one showed up. I tried to text over the chat but no response... and just now I receive a phone call from the cleaner saying that (her van broke down)... I offered to come pick her up or pay for the taxi but she then said (she got transferred to do another job). This is unacceptable.
Services were good. But should add customer care service. Currently no option to reach out to UC.
raj kumar ,sushil has worked very nice,cleaned properly
Happy üòä
Seepage issue wasn't addressed properly.One Himanshu connected from Urbancompany team ,explained me that there is no guarantee on the services and don't depend on urban company !!
Excellent üëç good job
A welcome relief. Most essential services are available and prices are reasonable. And service is really great.
Worst service ever. Urban chor. Pathetic service . Criminal action should be taken against such company. Wearing their company apparel people do half work and go for other private work. It's ascam company.
Good experience got my refrigerator fixed within a day
If you ever wish to get cheated just try this app.. They won't do any service just simply they will charge u bill for 30secs of work. I am charged with 300 bucks for 30 secs. By the way my service has not been done so I wish that you should be aware of this cheaters.
Frauds and cheats. Fourth time the booking cancellation happens as no professional assigned on the alloted time. Second time done in the same day. Even bookings made 3-4 days back are useless. Wasted my money in taking their annual subscription, when they can't even assign professionals duly and waste customer's time. Pathetic app!
They should trained their professionals how to behave with the customers
One of the worst service ever book only if you have lot of extra time to waste specially on sunday or holiday they just ruined your holiday no response no prior information, they have the height of care less. Booked 3 times this time taken their 1 year membership too. and 3 of two times no one came to scheduled slot. Seriously hate you urban company
The professionals who come,don't carry the products mentioned in the package and use substitute products. The cost of requested package is higher than the cost of substitute products used. Dimneiching, the professional, just walked out without giving the service! Extremely rude behaviour. I no longer trust that the professionals will use genuine products. They may even use some cheap one in an empty old bottle to just fool the customer.
Technicians in urban company are good. Rate of services are affordable & transparent. Best thing I like about this apps is transparent rates of services. Now I don't get overcharged by local-service guys.
I want to give Zero star for the service experienced today. Highly unacceptable, damage of bathroom fitting and gyser pipes during installation of a simple Gyser. So called professional says your builder has not used good quality material. Highly unacceptable. Registered my online complain but seems no one is bothered. No way to call or contact customer care or any person.
Very useful app with good UI.
I opted for pest control but the assigned executive did not came, I emptied my whole kitchen and other rooms but at last moment the service got canceled. I wasted my Saturday in doing all that stuff but these non professional guy never picked my call or called back. Poor service.
V üëçüèª thanks
I booked parlour service for home after waiting whole day there is a call that there is no beautician available if there is no beautician in urbanclap available why do they take the booking to waste time
They keep on rescheduling even without asking
I am happy with the way the hair was cut.
Professional
Very useful to find all services at one place in an unknown city
Good and fast service
They do not provide the executive timely
always go for Urban Company. superb work done by Jitendra
The pest control guy calls us one hour before and asks us to remove all the utensils from the kitchen and then after 15 minutes cancels the service. What kind of professional attitude is that ?
one of the most useful apps with range of services . saves time and efforts of searching for electricians/ plumbers / cleaners etc.
Pathetic service where they accept the bookings but fail to provide any professionals and forces us to cancel or reschedule at the very last moment.
Customer care does time pass with the customers. Plz ask to call
Still waiting for a call back or refund on my cancelled booking
professional and prompt!
Please improve the performance of the app. It's dead slow.
Excellent job by Rohit Singh....very polite
Pathetic experience. Professional accept the booking but don't turn up.
person was very polite professional and neat , took proper precautions for COVID I would definitely recommend the service and I myself will continue to use their services
Highly unprofessional service. They are not at all reliable. It looks like if anyone books an appointment with UC and even though the booking gets confirmed there's no 100% guarantee that the professional will get assigned on time. It's like cheating customers and not keeping up the professional commitment. It's highly unethical. For my booking done on Friday for Sunday's appointment at 10 am, till now i.e 1.45 pm Sunday, no professional has been assigned and excuses are being given.
Barber cut my sons ear, already sent mail. Now you are calling me and telling that its a very small cut. Great. What is your customers care number. You guys cut the call in between saying its just a small cut.
Really convenient and good professionals
great help when local services are not available in the vicinity.
Mr shabudeen does excellent job. patience and we'll behaved
Poor booking experience
There is no way to reach out to customer service on the app or otherwise. Also, the charges that they show are different then what they apply. There is so called convenience fees which is technically an overriding hidden surcharge. After all this there is no way to get support. Very disappointing
The worst service provider ever. Very unprofessional. These people are fraud they are just taking money without fixing the issue. There customer support is the worst ever
Pathetic service Ac technician damaged outdoor unit leaked the gas and asked extra money for refilling he was not professional and didn't cleaned the place also strongly recommend not to trust UC instead book from the OEM service or repair
neat and clean
I love
fast and efficient
Very good services....some of their professional do need training in being just that...Overall a truly pleasent experience...Keep it up Guys
Veshdu app
I am editing my review because I am happy with urban services as there was issue with my ac services but now it's resolved. Looking forward to purchase one more year subscription! Thanks you urban team.
High ly suggested and customer centric company
Good service by Urban Company but price should be some less by company
Highly unprofessional. The assigned professional cancels the booking on their own without the knowledge of the customers. They do not value customer timings.
Very professional service . They arrive on time.
Trying to book for electrician from last 4 days. It says no slot available. Waste of time. No call service available as well.
I am using various services available through this app. Very much satisfied with the services. Excellent services being provided by the service experts. Will certainly recommend this app for various services they provide.
Good
Wrost app it show video consulting but never connect
Pathetic service. Had called a plumber service at home and the professional left without completing the service. False commitment made by the professional assigned made us waste 3 to 4 days with tap leaking. Not worth following up also as help centre professional asked us to wait for another 24 Hours. Totally disappointed with the service quality and the experience of issues. No responsibility taken by the company to ensure to close the call from their end, we only have to follow up.
The categorization of this app can get confusing. The customer care manager is not supportive. They are ok if the customer is dissatisfied and disappointed. If any problem with the app they will tell you to go and check the website. Also they don't bother for customers at all, so customer service if I could give it would be a big Zero!
The plumber took 800 rupees to correct the issue. And told to cancel the booking. He said if you don't cancel we will not deliver the service properly. We paid 800 rupees to solve the problem still our problem persists. Urban company doesn't have any option to raise the matter and we are left with no choice than to accept the hardship.
No pedicure for men's and not able to know the customer care number in app.
Very useful services.
good
I booked cleaning on a Sunday 5 days prior. The cleaner rescheduled it to Tuesday. I rejected reschede. Still it got rescheduled. There is no customer care no. Nothing. Worst company.
Utter waste service ,i have booked salon after keeping me wait for hours the person NVR turned up and then customer care called and reschedule it and the result is the same
No option to call customer care. The app is rescheduling service time without even checking with me
so disappointing... its my first time engaging manicure service and the appointment was supposed to be at 10am. Till 10.15am there was no one who showed up and I had to call the company to enquire where my manicurist was. In the end i was told that the scheduled manicurist was on mc and they are not able to get a replacement and I had to reschedule my slot. I would have appreciated a call to inform me abt it instead of having me to call and wait. Super unpleasant experience before I even start
Only fraud inside is going on
Thank you so much. üíì
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. I have booked a bathroom cleaning service on 20-Nov-2021. After professional has completed work i have realised that water is coming out of the flush tank (instead of going into the commode) . I have raised my concern/complaint on your app. Representative from the escalation department had called me and informed me that he had checked with the service guy and as the service guy denied that he is not responsible for the water leakage.
I have felt best experience with UC for AC services mostly. Few bad experience with washing machine... so guys for AC go for UC Clap blindly... Thank you!!
perthetic services, and I will post this every day
There are no options in the app to cancel subscription... horrible app.
Why is there no option to speak to cust. Executives or an email id for grievance redressal? There is a horrid help center which addresses the most basic question on may have. For a tech company, you guys are pathetic
very efficient
Intially the charges were still affordable and appropriate... They have increased the price like anything.. No valid offers or discounts available...
After home visit for the small carpenter work double the paument was asked and i have to cancel. Even annual members do charged with cancellation fee. UC looks useless for household works. I regret for buying plus membership there is no benifit.
The app is hanging a lot. Have been trying to get pass the payment mode ..i just wanted to change the mode of payment n it just hangs...really sucks have been trying through out the day to book a service
Not satisfied. Beautician not expert. Very bad experience last 2 sitting. So I don't use this app. Yes madam app better than urban clap
Such a respite to have your services as a go to for any emmergency..keep it up
1. The professiona did not show up & instead sent another person of his behalf. 2. The other person come 45 min late 3. He did not have an urban company id & was not vaccinated either 4. The service was denied. 5. No easy way to contact the company This is my 3rd experience with urban company. First was a consultation. We paid 99 & did not receive the quote. Second was a plumber who said the job was beyond his scope and we were charged 50 Rs. And this is 3rd where the service is denied.
good job urban company
very professional.
The worest cleaning services ever,they r just not responsible or trusted

good
Pathetic service. At night a day before your service they cancel your hair styling service. How would you go and book another's service so late with someone else. If you don't have people available for a particular time slot dont keep that time slot instead of causing inconvenience to your customer. Would never book again through urban company
Very good
Worst service. From last week they are just rescheduling the service and till date not provided. No customer support to address it. Pathetic experience
Hair cutting was pathetic
Excellent.Thoroughly satisfied.This was my first time experience .Habib did the entire kitchen and bathroom cleaning all alone without complaining and resting Very patiently he remove the utensils and replaced them back .
No customer care number in app .. Flipkart coupon code not added while booking
Super
Improving my rating. My cancellation refund made promptly although no information was given at the time of cancellation. My next booking was a good experience. I could contact Kiran on phone. He arrived on time. He worked patiently. Only some hard water stains on the wall tiles and some light stains on floor tiles remained. Overall, it was a very good experience. I would strongly recommend the app and it's services
Service and technicians are very good but the spare parts are exhorbidantly priced. The prices are more than double and triple of the market price. Even when the spare parts prices are compared with the prices from online platforms like Amazon or flipkart, the prices of Urban Company is more than double. I think this is highly unacceptable
Professional took my product for a repair promising that it will be delivered within 2-3 days however it is going to be 2 weeks now the product has not been returned. While tried calling the professional, he won't answer calls neither the customer care is supportive.
service is excellent
Easy to use & navigate.
Service provided is not good. Customer care also promised to complete my problem, even that also did not happen.
Of late their customer support has become rigid, focusing only on their policies with regards to refund procedure. I've requested twice to provide UC credits instead of bank transfer to avoid time waste. Why would I again proceed with fresh service when the money is already struck in refund process? It's not like I'm disappointed but their policies amused me. Usually when cancelations surface, companies would provide credits as first option to retain customers. üòÖ
Worst technician and quoting high price. Once issue addressed after couple of week again issue coming again they servicing in warranty again couple of weeks coming issue.
Good performance
Prices are comparatively higher than market, membership allows max 100 INR discount, but that is again collected back as service charge, handling charges, etc. Tried booking same professional, either the professional won't show, or no slots available, worst part there is no way to talk to customer care. Home repair services are most disappointing, especially carpenter. Cleaning service is good, saloon service is ok types. There is scope of improving unless someone cares.
Madrachod company hai
worst service not cming on time and also no response from customer service.Not seen such pathetic and worst service in my lifetime. Beware of Urbany Company app.
Throwing error when I tried to book for sofa cleaning ..I haven't had good user experience..They should remove or let the user know if the service is not available while using app.
Bad service, professional cancels
Super professional& wonderful experience
good app for service
Excellent service
Awesome
well provided service
Very good promt and efficient service received from UC since last 4 years
Unprofessional service! Doesn't assign professional on time. No compensation. Would not recommend this. Job started after approx 1.5 hrs delay.
Shitfest this company is. Complete trash
Best services provided
The job was done well.
27 Nov 21 Today I've taken kitchen deep cleaning service. Though the full amt was paid, the app shows an extra ‚Çπ670/- to be pd. Called UC cust service. The exec from UC Nitin Tiwari was rude & didn't resolve the issue. Instead demanded I select pd in cash option as its a glitch in the app 07 Oct 21 The ratings of carpenter gets modified. I rated a carpenter 1, but UC app shows that I have rated him 5. I have experienced the same with a plumber. Looks like UC is manipulating customer ratings.
Excellent and Professional
Awesome üëå
No customer care support available.
It's good service
So pathetic service, yesterday I booked slot of 7:30 she came at 9:30 and continuously she was promoting their products and apart from that she burnt my skin
very nice üëçüëç and good
First time aisa used experience was very good.
rate card is different app is not working properly
inspite of paying the entire servicing amount in advance at the end of service UC generated additional payable amount. It has put the service professional as well as us in a peculiar position. No response fro UC SOS. Horrible SOS. Don't rely on that. The professional provided excellent service. UCs app and SOS cannot address such situations. They are not at all user friendly and do not want to help user No way to approach UC customer care. Please refund my excess paid money immediately.
Very convenient. Prompt good service. I fully recommend Urban Company services.
great
Unprofessional, untrustworthy, just plain liars!
I have paid 1200 for hair cutting for men package and 299 for prime membership. Every time I have to cancel my booking as professional not arriving in time and not responding to calls. This has happened four times for my all bookings. I am fed up with your service. So please refund total amount I paid in full.
My last experience was very poor, it's feels only vendor and their professional supportive.i am going to uninstall
Workers takes pic of sanitizer but never uses it. U should ask him to upload video of using sanitizer at cust premises else ur sanitization charges are fake
Pathetic service. Tv installation service booked for Saturday (27/11/2021). Customer care executive called and informed that due to rain, no service can be offered. Then I requested for service on the weekdays at 8 am as there is a schedule slot Available as per app. That also they can't arrange. This is not a Customer friendly app. How to you think, working people to use your app. It's better to look for local people. If I had the chance to give 0 STAR, I would prefer that
Professional did not arrive on time. There was no information as well. Bad service
satisfied with their services
From this app workers my aunt got corona
Reducing the star rating for the following reasons, App is not able to proceed further after selecting the slot After 15 times, booked a carpenter they declined to visit...no proper communication whether they will come or not.. Some how i felt like the way it was serving initially and the way now is changed from 5 to 1.. Very disappointed
Great service for Covid
Just now viewed your advertisement ,"with sword s, its a worst ad. Please remove.
I had my AC serviced recently. They did a very thorough job. Very efficient and polite.
It was very good
Professional doesn't reach on time and denied service last moment. It is indeed a harassment to the customer.
Very bad...very dissappointed...in kanpur no professionalism....beautician was totally confused with the timings..she was confused with am and pm....very unprofessional behaviour.
Unable to automatically choose my home address while booking tickets. Im forced to type my address multiple times. Guess, this was not the case earlier as I'm a long time user of the app
Cant exit the app from back button. Pls help..
The service provided by the app is great but while selecting it is confusing as to what service is included and what is not, for example in toilet cleaning has 3 option and what is included is not mentioned such as shower cabin cleaning is included or not and if yes in which of the 3 is it in. Also the help centre option is useless as one can't connect to anyone to get their point clarified. The app needs better support team and the services inluded should be mentioned. However brief it may be.
Urban company is utter waste... Fooling around wit people.. der professionals are not well experienced... Dey doesn't knw how to fix or solve the problem... I had booked for washing machine service,dat professional came saw the machine n said he vil cme bk tomorrow ( Wednesday) but till Friday he dint cme.. n wen I m trying to reach dem, no response.... Worst experience ever
I would definitely prefer UC salon service at home as they follow all the safety protocols like wear mask, sanitised hand. Choose time slot according to our convenience with affordable prices.
It's not working properly it is not showing all the facial brands
Very Professional, knowledgeable and Polite Servicemen!
#KOLKATA.Please make a wish from the urban company because whatever technician is here and comes to service and fills the gas and leaves and charges maximum money. This is a fraud company from you, don't disagree with each other.
very good service
Pathetic service from urban company. The technician spoilt my Ac. The insurance policy for a month is farce because they do not send anyone. The customer service do not understand anything and can't help. Very poor Service. If only they had changed their attitude rather than Company name, things would have been better.
Had bad experience with paste control. Nobody came for follow up paste control. Cockroaches came back. Pathetic. No follow up from their side..
Excellent management...excellent service by team UC. Keep it up!
Awesome app. Quick response.
What I like about Urban is; the available technician is allotted at your convenient time not theirs. You get a rate card. They bring along the necessary tools. They work in your site. You have an authority to report to in case of dissatisfaction
I har booked plumbing service. Even after 24 hrs they were not able to get professional assign to my request. They requested reschedule again and again. But at last they were not able to assign professional and asked me to cancel my booking. I would have given -ve rating, but it's not available. Hopeless service.
Horrible service provide.. and the customer service was also pathetic ...
Great experience - professional cleaner!
very nice good job
I have tried to book salon service for Hinjewadi Pune location from last week almost every day and it was frustated user experience for me. There is no option to select slot and date in the app. I mean if you don't have services available in any specific area please show the appropriate message in the notification window. The worst application ever and worst user experience.
Extraordinary
Amazing experience
If you wish to waste time and money then use Urban Clap. Booked a service engineer for washing Machine and five days no one turned up and there is no control on there mechanics. Remember you cannot call UrbanClap for support send a message they will call back and you can expect a call back in few HOURS. Caution Every time a appointment is scheduled Rs 50 will be charged.
Great home service provider company
excellent service
Very third class experience...
Good app. And reliable
Worst service ever, one time the professional did not pickup the call and second time i reschedule it but no professional assigned and there response is they can again reschedule it.
Now a days professional who will be assigned will not arrive on time else they will reschedule it giving some reasons.price is also getting high with no offers is given. But the work the professional does is good
Extremely unethical. They take bookings and cancel at their will and do not refund the amount. Had a horrible experience. Bunch of liars
Poor service....i booked for 4 pm...they asked me to shift the booking to sunday and then upon insisting gave me a booking of 6:30 which was of no use....n informer me late due to which my whole day went waste.... Bad service to opt for during urgency
good app for work
Very unprofessional beauticians...need to upgrade services... bookings got cancelled twice in day.. very bad experience.. horrible service team n beauticians..
Inspite of booking a service, no action from the company, no reply or any kind of confirmation. Where has Professionalism gone?
My first experience with UC home cleaning was quite good. The crew brought all the supplies and was very efficient. The app is a great way to book/cancel. My only request is to improve the APP because it takes a long time to load!
very fast and good work
Good service
Good service......
Pathetic experience with pest control service. When a complaint is raised customer support professional were very adamant and not ready to listed or resolve the issue properly. UC is basically cheating the customers, they'll first charge you heavily showcasing the advertisements and false commitments, once you opt a service they'll cheat by using some cheap products and on raising complaints support guys will treat like they're doing some favours offering 10% of amount you paid, issue unresolved
good
Non sense service. UC cheat customer. Pls dont take membership. They dont give service and do not return membership fees also. Legal action must be taken against these bluff startups
All in one solution for all my home needs!!!
the service is very good and the guy was also very sweet üòä
Unprofessional providers and worst customer support
Excellent service.
Service providers go to the wrong location, arrive late, and then the app takes payment 3 times (plus the service provider asks for cash). When complaint is raised they don't reply to emails and show zero ownership. Clearly grown too fast as a company. Terrible experience, avoid! Note - this is experience in Dubai.
Good morning
There's no way to connect with the Company on call.
Good & prompt service by Urban Company. The technician Mr. Madhusudan was very cooperative & competent.
Trust issues with their beauticians .first they tell u how badly they r treated by UC and than ask u to call them personally. And they ask for financial help.and once u do this they will not even come for your services or return money.Maya Paul is one of them
Poor services, send technicians that uses duplicate parts, dont rely. No customer care support to connect with. No one will hear to your quieries and requests.
Very recently had a bad experience with their service. I booked for cleaning. Professional came but argued for the booking type and demanded extra money apart from already paid amount. Later when I agreed they noted OTP also and went out with the reason to bring chemicals and canceled the booking without informing.Moreover, they have cut 50 rupees as cancelation fee as if I have canceled their booking. When I called executive, she told their app showing cancellation done by me. N didn't refund.
This company is cheater
Good
Good
Want this uc on gudivada plz provide your services on gudivada 521301 üôè
expert cleaners. on time really appreciated.
Good services
i have very good experience.
It was good until one beautician came and damaged my skin while waxing. I selected ( auto expert) and she keep talking during the whole time and imploring to give her 5 star rating. Moreover, she burnt both of my hand. And it's been more than one month ,it is not resolved. I've pictures of that as a proof.
Chor h ye company
Very good services by Urban Company. They have affordable prices and services done by professional. Proper hygiene with proper safety and precautions.
Pathetic service. The Carpenters demand the money of their own choice. Things which could have been done in 100 outside, I ended up paying 600 for the same. I take it as a scam despite of taking a plus membership, I ended up being hostile in carpenter's hand. Please avoid using their services.
The service was good but then there is an Issue with the service and it's under warranty but no response from UC. Initially it was mentioned that the team will call in 15 mins but it's been 24hours now since I complained and it just shows the team will call soon. Dunno what to do. Can't find any helpline number. Edit: great job to have the courtesy to call after my review in here, but was of no use. It was just like a call to cross over the warranty time that was promised during the service.
Worst sevice ever. Professionals dont come according to the given slot and even they don't pickup the calls . They make excuses and switch off their phones .
Horrible experience . The cleaning was supposed to be at 1 pm they came at 5pm , the lady was aggressive and I had to clean after she left as I could see that she didn't mop properly neither removing dust
Disappointing. Booked a week ago and been waiting for half an hour. No one called till i requested call back just to inform me they cannot fulfill the booking. Last time they sent the person without supplies when we booked with it. over priced overrated company.
only service is good products results not good
Good
Worst experience ever I've ordered for bathroom and kitchen cleaning in an apartment and when I contacted that guy he started telling me his own problems that his bike brokedown and stuff Is it my problem? And I have to pay for cancellation fees My friends have similar experience with this app that your person will cancel and we have to pay for cancellation this is ridiculous Never expected this from urban company And there is no customer care number to call also Very shameless company
Very good service In Ucompany
No customer service. For pest control they write in BHK but they do not include kitchen and washroom in it
Worst service.. Any representative coming asking for more money.. If you book normal cleaning ask for deep cleaning. If you book deep cleaning asking for move in cleaning.. or ask do 100 rs offline payment for us..
Worst help and support center
Super unprofessional. They cancelled my appointment last minute and didn't even inform me. I was left waiting for calls. Their call center executives are also very rude and cut the phone on my face instead of offering any solutions or compensation. I do not recommend this app.
Worst... Beautician was not assign ..waited for long...tried to connect with customer center...but couldn't...thankfully..I dint paid in advance...be carefully..their service is getting worse...n this company will not last..if this kind service is provided....
Awful. Don't believe in their warranty. No one comes for the reservice if u claim the warranty. And their customer support is equally awful.
Till now no problems faced.. Keep providing the service accurately üôÇ
Electrical, carptner n beautification didn like
very covinient
Uodate- got my issue resolved after sending an email. Thank you.. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX The app is not user-friendly at all. Irritated to the core. The new update has made it so difficult to use it.. where the f.. k is the delete account option.. I have 2 acc. I want to delete one of them.
Go for it..best thing in this pendamic
Best sarvis
these people are professionals.highly recommended.
Not good experience, Carpenter abruptly cancelled the booking
Fraud company . They hire professionals without keping any check. Got cheated again
nice services
Pathetic service. If there have been an option for no star, I would haven't given you this 1 star also. Payment done in advance, no beautician assigned till the scheduled time, not able to connect with customer support after requesting many times. Not sure whether I would get my money back or not. This review is also being deleted by their backend team. Please don't use this app, their service is pathetic.
very nice
good
very nice
nice experience with him. Felt genuine
I have ordered for fan cleaning,due to the light coloured fans still the stains remain,I recommend ub to give powerful solvents to clean tough stains
Don't book any service from UC. After advance payment they are not capable to provide services and for refund also they want 5to 7 days, totaly froud team. After all you will not get any response from UC team we care full.
I have booked my car cleanup twice on this application, both the time no one from there team turned up at my place While discussing this issue with the customer care executive both the time, they said we can help you with the services after thee days from the schedule date or you can cancel it, and guess what post cancellation the amount get transferred to your account post 7 days that too when it's there mistakes
Very poor and unsatisfactory service in varanasi up.
Pathetic service. Initially they rescheduled service 2 times because no carpenter available. When carpenter got available, they cancelled the booking, now I am not even able to connect with carpenter. And on top of that, there is now way to connect with customer care. UC behaves at god level, oy they can connect with you, you can't.
super satisfied with services.
Good Work done satisfactorily
It's too good
Nice and good service
Women Beauticians are very well behaved, well mannered and do their job well...
very useful app for all your need
Worst üëé never come on time every time change timing poor service
Very professional and committed Aircon technicians. Tks.
Worst Experience from the past 3-4 bookings. I never expy this from Urban Company
Rude attitude. Unprofessional plumber. The assigned plumber's name was Rajib Biswas.
excellent work by suthesh
No human touch, some questions can't be answered, need a customer service number.
Tried to contact the engineer via this app and it keeps asking me to enter the pin number which is not shared with me. So I am unable to reach the engineer and getting frustrated with this stupid system in this app.
Very good service
Nice
Because it is too hard to reach to your customer care number.
very good service options. profesional in work
Awesome
booked the service and took membership. But have been requested to cancel as professional not available. Only service amount is getting refunded and cancellation of membership is not allowed. Worst experience.
The professional at Urban are using their name to fool customers. We have faced the problem where the professional said that the filter needs to be replaced and he gave new one which is not working.
Nice

Very bad service. First they accept booking but will not assign any professional. Even if assigned they call and cancel on us. Can't reach customer support, and no callback from them if we raise query. App is very bad and not user friendly. Very bad Experience.
Very bad customer service support. Getting worst day by day.
very professional personals
Very poor. Had request for water purifier servicing, but he screwed up and did not turn to rectify the issue. He had replaced with very old part from year 2014.
now its become worst clean app, I advise not to use it there are not professional at all.
Cheated through this app. Pls don't use it.
excellent service üòä
Very nice work We spread as maximum as possible
Customer care executives are the worst.. they said they will arrange replacement as my professional cancelled. I asked for same slot. They accept in phone and they rescheduled with out intimation. Did not expect this from UC
Nice app happy with the services I think a male hair dresser should also be allowed to do hair cut for girls bcz some are professionals and we have to request them to come offline to do hair cut and sometimes they don't agree with it I think u should also keep an option like this for hair cuts only
Very very bad experience. Never expected this from urban company..four times they have denied service
Best option as per required time .
professional was friendly in nature and serve me best..happy with the service
Very disturbing company. They are not able to serve their 4 year old customers. Hopeless service and when you are unwell they dont bother for that, they just disturb you with unnscry calls. And while you seek solution they dont provide.
good hair cutting and beard trimming services
Good ...
2 star since Urban clap quote expensive charges
Tomorrow services - their professional will come tomorrow and we wait for that tomorrow to come first. Customer support is mostly arrogant and irresponsible.
Simple and quick, excellent services
great service provider for almost everything. However UC should share service OTP over whatsapp or sms or app notification. The present system of going into booking and fetching OTP is inconvenient specially if it has to be shared with family member in your absence
Latest version sucks unable to make payment and book service
Difficult to choose customer support option
Excellent app...
This one star is for their unprofessional cleaning services that they provide in Dubai... They cancel your booking by giving a very silly and same reason all the time, they put me in trouble twice where I had prebooked for maid service since I was hosting a party at home & last minute they call to say they have to cancel the appointment as their maid has taken an emergency leave. This is very unprofessional I have faced a lot of trouble all my work and planning for 2 of parties went for a toss.
Not all services are available in my place. I have availed few and they were really good. It would be good have other services as well
Customer care is so poor they didn't responded on my query...bathroom cleaner denied their duty when I canceled urban company ppl deducted my money...I should not take their membership I feel like I got cheated
chrge is so high service good
Overpriced services, charged 1600 for the gyeser repair, which was available in 700, company charged twice for same thing. Don't go for this company, uninstalling app also..will not recommended to any one.. check price in market before taking any service.
Third class service provider No use. Even the customer service is useless. It's just a money making company
Had my appointment scheduled for the day and they canceled it at the very last moment. Very unprofessional.
Providing Excellent Services In Kanpur.
Simply hate it...I would not suggest this company...as it uses fake products....and beauticians also dnt knw what they r using...they blame it on company...plz dnt take risk with your skin with them...HATE IT
Always get a wonderful service from Urban company...Thank you üòä
amazing service
Worst customer support and was not in a position to provide any resolution to unsatisfactory service which involved broken toilet seat
1 star since last update, every time i want to book a service, have to delete and reinstall the android app else impossible to book a service.
I have been booking a service but professionals aren't assigned.. few months you guys 2-3 days to assign a professional but you guys couldn't. This time also no professional. Horrible customer service
One of the worst companies I have ever seen and faced. No professionalism. No dedication. No work ethics. The workers were not upto the mark. They won't show up on time. When ever u call they always assign their workers after hours( after 7 PM) but still they won't showup. The customer care service is even beyond worse. They keep on mumbling and when we ask to escalate the phone call to the next superior they won't connect and disconnect the call. I highly recommend not to use this application.
Very useless and pathetic app...
very good service
Executive asked me to reschedule and I did, a new executive wasn't assigned. The help centre asks me to request a callback, but there's no such option! What am I supposed to do??
From business point of view - Service is great, specially the measures taken for covid situation. Best services to rely on. App experience - Overall good, not any glitches observed. Just a suggestion. It could be more interactive. Suggestions - As of now for consultation also fees is charged (suppose that for carpenter service). Maybe that we can have free of cost, it might attract more customers and eventually many would turn to opt for service.
Once you book service there is no option to reach customer care or get any support. Really bad service.
Service became very bad, always delays. There is no option to cancel all scheduled bookings, as their app tricks you into the only option of pausing them for some two months. Once I requested for them to cancel all my future booking, they stopped replying to my whatsapp and phone calls.
The app is not working on my phone since so long. Pls resolve asap.
I had booked an electrician for washing machine repair, the visit has gotten rescheduled 4 times. Yet no one is responding. Neither the customer support is responding. Pathetic service.... Do not use this application.
Pathetic services. I am uninstalling this app.
Bad exprince
I booked uc services couple off times from same location where I stay. Now when I am trying to book, it says no slots available and doesn't even allow me to book for a future date. Each time I face a New issue with this app.
Nisha Jadhav e
Nalyek company
The professionals are not ethical in their approach to the services assigned to them. The app shows Cleaning and Pest Control services but there is no pest control service included among the various services being provided. There are bugs in the app.
The experience was bad this time. I have booked for pest control service and under new developments of pest control service of 15 days gap, still following up for the service. The professional is yet not assigned. Do not know how to get this resolved. I feel like ditched. However the UC service was not like this before. Need help....
Worst response
There was update from customer care to connect them. I did and still problem exists after second visit. Really these are not trained technicians. Please don't comment asking to contact customer care again! Service is not uoto tthe mark.
very good service in patna
Experience was good
Horrendous Sevices offered! Untrained and ill mannered professionals who cancel the bookings at the very last moment, leaving customers hanging! I totally vote against this company and their unprofessional cleaners! Don't waste your valuable time and money them! Pathetic! I'm cancelling my subscription right away!
Super company it is a nice company
very good and nice serive I ever seen
I booked the make up and hairstyle appointment for 5 pm and prepaid for the same and you people rescheduled it to 6:30 pm and informing to me about it at 3 pm. My function has to start by 7 pm ,what is the use of rescheduling to 6:30 instead you should have assigned someone for 5 pm only, at last moment I had to rush and look for someone offline, it was a pathetic experience for me, will never consider ur services and neither would recommend. only good thing was that my refund came immediately
Block my account why
I am not able to see all newly launches in "salon for women" for Hyderabad location where as i can see all newly launches product for Mumbai location Even i uninstalled my app and again installed it then also i am not able to see newly launched service in my app. Plz help
good service and very professional
Technicians are not properly responding on time.. There is no specific customer care numbers to call and update the status
service of loveleen kaur was perfect
good service
Excellent
It was the best experience.
all good üòÄüëçüèª
Worst experience I can ever have. Today I booked a massage for my mother and for about 3times I need to reschedule the time becoz their proffesionals call me nd give deir excuses nd says if i cn reshedule d day or time. Still I did that nd nw automatically dey reshedule it to another day. hw dey can do it? If customer wnts a service they will book it frm their own convenience nd dey should match it with theirs. not according to them we need to have it. Earlier it was a good experience no dbt bt.
Very bad app
very good
The nail polish no choices all are old expired dryed

urban app is a very usefull & timing also perfect.
very good service
Advance taken for painting. No work started
Excellent app, helpful team
There is no customer supports... I have call a machanic through urban clap but its take membership charges along with service charges..isse achha hai ki aap bahar se local machanic se kaam karao.. jyada achha rahega..
The app has bug and price of some of the services are wrong. The professionals reject service outright and no way to contact uc for the same. Pathetic
Mr Syed garu is an excellent UC contact person, with his explaining of work to be done about Waching machines is really worth and we r pleased so much about his technical advise for the repair og WM. Regards UC Prof.N.janakirama rao. Motinagar Hyderabad 500018
myvservice charegs are not being refunded after availing the service
Excellent services
good service
One of best app. Fast service. No hidden charges or cost. Really life saver app. Loved it
I have 4 visit booking, and they came 9nce, and never again. I paid by card for 4 visits
Excellent service First time tried with UC Really happy and worth for trusting UC.Professional is very humble and core to his profession. Thank u so much to UC and Mr. Ithayathulla who did the service.
Very bad experience, beautician herself didn't come ,they themselve canceled my booking and charged 50 rs on me as cancelation charges
No Response , Since 30 Days. Policy are against customer. Highly Unprofessional !!! Pathetic, All Service done by 3rd party which is Highly Unprofessional. No meaning to spend money. It's completely wastage of money Moreover, No Customer Centric Approach. I dont recommend to use Urban company. Booking schedule given for 17 Oct 9 am, but No Response. Unprofessional Approach , Poor Response. No provision to escalate issue. It's Completely Wastage of time & money. I highly recommend, NOT TO USE.
Superb service and extremely polite in nature
how do i reach customer care. every service i select the app says professionals are not available
Poor service
Froud Chor company
Even I don't want to give one star...urban company's service is worst now...there no no contact option..if you have any issues with the service and any thing you can't talk with the executive and no one goin to help you with the problems..i face the situation...if you want to save your money don't book them any more..let them realise that our money is not for free..worst app worst service and worst experience...
Unable to book kids haircut,i am unable to go to summary page
Unprofessional service and poor customer care support.
Totally Waste of money and time
How could you assign if your professional doesn't come on time and you don't even give customer care number to sort out problem. This is worst experience i m having on urban company. If your professional doesn't come on time slot given by costumer then they shouldn't take it. How could you resign slot on the spot? You don't even consider customer time value then why do you guys provide professional who doesn't even know time slot properly
good service
Urban company not good
Very good
Wrong commitment and wrong msg posted in app and no service profession to addres the request and providing warranty with no use. No track of refund request.
ggh
Urban clam Every warker only tame pass wark just small wark 2 to 3 hour slow
Professional came on time and left after service is done was punctual and maintain ed all safety measures .
I like the idea. and the service
Technician to be trained properly before assigning a project..
Very expensive
Not very professional...arrived very late and then had to be told what to do to do a thorough job ....though they don't want us to interfere. Considering I paid more that 4200 for cleaning of my house....I expected much more attention to detail....
Excellent.. happy to use it....
Excellent experience every time with Urban Company, the service providers are totally pro in their work, and love the way they take every precaution about hygiene, the products before using are sealed packed which are shown to customers before opening and applying. And everything available at your doorstep with pocket friendly packages. What one wants more than these..!üòç
Worst online portal.They lie and cheat people.No professionalism.The partners do not response neither call center.Big fake ,don't trust.
Excellent
this app claims that they have a standard rate card for parts of your appliances but their invoice does not follow the rate card, they put hidden charges and claim it as an invoice as per rate card. Very disappointed and unprofessional way of billing.
Ibooked 1day chef trial.He was not able to cook anything and wasted my 3 hrs whereas it was written that the service will be completed in 1 hr 30 mins.The professionals are not really trained.At second slot,he marked the job as completed but did not come.What is the use of service OTPif your professionals can mark the job as completedwithout OTP?And money is already paidwhen tried to reach customer service they marked the issue as resolved but did notresolve.This is not really acceptable.Fraud!
Do not take their uc membership.I faced issue while booking professional for appliance repair. They will allow booking for particular slot. But no executive will visit your place. Ultimately I had to book someone from local. What is point of having uc membership discount if service itself is not available.
good
1. After booking when going to the booked items the details keeps loading. 2. When revisit booking is done due to improper with the original it's asking for payment, customer care asking to select cash, but due to above option unable to do anything.
Was not satisfied with the bathroom cleaning work. Asked to do the cleaning again but still it's not done. Cleaning was done where there was assurance for the shine for next two months, but the shine did not last for a week also.
Cheminy was well cleaned.
good work
Worst service
Great
Excellent,all services are good
very good
Very nice
Early it was good but not any more technical dont come at time waste of membership as well technical forcefully get 5 star rating for me i dont want too
Excellent work for all workers
Bitan karmakar is very good pro
Excellent and punctual
Please provide a long cutting sheet as it gets messy with a small cutting sheet with your professionals
Worst. You people are worthless and hopeless.
Very good
Useful app
Excellent service
All bad ratings so m sure its degraded
Worst experience with this UC professional. Following up from last 12 days on pest control n no response. Fake commitments from the assigned professional n customer care service. Still the issue is not resolved.
You are taking money before providing service? Your "professionals" lie that they can do the needed job and never come when called but you charge membership fee forcefully also.Why this is not refundable?
Personnel is well-trained and polite. Easy to use app interface and prices are also very good for in-home services.
Very disappointing! It is totally wast of your time and money. They don't bother about a person's time instead what you get in return is a reschedules for a wholeday. I hate this app.
some service are bit costly
Wrost service and chagres are tooo high. Not suitable for middle class people. I don't recommend this
nice
Spoiled my television.. now from 40 days daily a new call center executive calls and have to explain the case again and again ..hopeless service and problem solving is zero...
Smooth app..clear layout of services and quick payment and good service provided.. only part which I didn't like was the convenience fee that they charged which was 1/5th of the bill.
Worst service provider yesterday i booked for haircut they told me they will send someone in an hour then after an hour they told me they will send someone in tomorrow morning now they are telling me they will send sometime later.are u kidding us
Kindly improve your App ...I think all ratings here are fake...If everyone fill ratings in front of professionals so it's unfair.. atleast give plus hours for true ratings.
Experiences have been 50-50. Support team isn't capable of resolving issues. Your left at God's will and service providers mercy. If he screws up work your money is lost. Urban clap just raise hands saying we're negotiating between the two parties and remain silent spectators. Slowly migrating towards uninstalling the app and losing faith in the brand
Never book cleaning services from Urban clap . Esp Samrat services , never ever book them . I just paid them 4k+ just for them to visit my house and go . He bought 2 dirty clothes and chemicals they claim to use to clean the house is only Colin in diff bottle . He dint even clean the dust on the shelves , washrooms , nothing was cleaned . I will never ever book from Urban clap . I regret paying for the membership now.
Pathetic Experience with Urbam Company. I have booked few services with them and after booking I cant even see what have I booked?
The customer service is pathetic and seems they have no interest in resolving issues
nice
Amazing services and at fairly reasonable price!
Really helpful staff whom you can count on to take the burden of cleaning your house away. Definitely will recommend you to use this service and tip the people who do a good job so they can continue doing their work with a smile their face.
Useless company, failed to provide the service which was booked well in advance. Worst support.
very efficient for people like myself who have left our hometowns for profession and get easy to many important services at the click of a button.
I reffered the app to my friend and it is said that he will get 100rs off and I will get 100 rs copoun but even after him taking the service . We did not get any off or copoun . I felt disappointed for reffering to a friend . I will not refer anyone after this .
Their approach is professional and we were very much satisfied
worst service n I paid Rs. 3048 for just normal TV service l haha. In future I will not going to continue with Urban company 2nd worst experience very disappointed
Horrible and disgusting experience....don't know how this company is running at national level when they can't afford credible service in new delhi itself....they can't even assign professionals for the said job and customer care will never call plus sometimes the profesionals will come and charge more money than u have already paid on line...hope this company gets pulled down sooner...and some.. credible company comes up for our services
Booked electician for fan repairing, he came and took the fan along with rs 1300 and run away, its already been 15 days, i am only getting assurace from customer executive but no action has been taken so far..worst experience..
Very good service
If you have problems related to house give them a call to rectify it.
Puja mam u r excellent hairstylist
App is not at all working. It's not logging. Bit taking the location. Not opening any page.
Excellent üëåüëåüëå
One of the most irritating aspect about UC is that there is no customer care no. User have to first book the service and then very few customer care option opens up. I have questions on home deep cleaning, FAQs are ridiculous. I have no option but to book service and pay token amount and then maybe customer care option would be there. Sometimes customer care is not active till the actual start of service. You can't speak to anyone about issues mentioned. Literally anguished. Would look other app
Profissionals Excellent Work
Good app
Had very bad experience.The professional did not turned up on time and had to cancel the service booked
good application
Worst app. Accepted the booking morning hrs and given time 5:30 but not even assigned the person till 6pm . And not even update from concern department regarding professional allocation. Waited total day times waste . Plz don't use this app .
nice serives I'm so happy üòä
There are no professional worker.waste of time and waste of money. I had booked service appointment prior Two days ago for today's 9am. And enginer is calling at 9.30 am and sayings he will late for more one hour after that he asked me to cancel the booking.once I had denied to cancel he had cancelled the booking. After I.e.  I had blocked next slot for 3 pm and it's got reapted same service I got the call from Urban clap at 4.45and he ask me to cancel the booking. And he has canceld my booking
Raju Chakraborty, a professional of Kolkata destroyed the flush of our bathroom
They charged 50 without me cancelling the booking. Worst customer care service too.
It's simply awesome and useful.strongly recommended
great app
Excellent service
i like sarvic pratika
plz provide more service like bike and scooty repairs.
Great service professionally done....
Good
Excellent..
We scheduled service on Tuesday, since then our service got rescheduled many times from customer executive side..but no beautician came... every time the urban Company customer care executive is calling us and telling that they are rescheduling the service but it's just rescheduling nothing is happening here... just before the scheduled time like 15 to 20 minutes before we are receiving call from customer care executive and same story like beautician is not available...
No longer reliable. Had good experiences in past but now their Appliance Care plan seems like a scam. They took the money, no one came, raised complaint: no action no feedback and even raised complaint not allotted to anyone for 3 days. Seems something majorly wrong.
Good
A perfect place for getting hassle free repair jobs
Not happy at all. If there would be an option to rate lesser than 1 star I would have given that rating. I regret buying your plus membership.
Pricing is very costly.. compared with actual
Very unprofessional.. the assigned professional did not turn us also she was not concerned about informing..
There has been expansion at the cost of quality, truthfulness, professional behaviour. I think the organisation should look into it. The grievance site is full of such reviews on unprofessional behaviour of urban company.... A big mistake to take a membership....a waste of money time and peace of mind to deal with such a firm
nice service providing app. üëç
Worst experience, unprofessional customer care people. Two books same bad experience 1. Annual service - after full payment only two visits later no update and CCare team first said refund possible later said not possible. Very cheap trick used for income 2. Boothroom cleaning - no service provided and only doing reschedule
Must have app
Not for men wexs in delhi
it good
Worst
There is no way we can contact the urban company. We r at the mercy of the designated vendors. Atleast they must have a chat box for our doubts.
Pathetic service.. Never recommend
very satisfying
Good app
Worst xperience.fraud company.hires inefficuent workers.highly disrecomended
Works really well. Excellent service provided every single time.
It's ok please put ads in regional languages y u put hindhi in Bangalore
I regret to take plus membership but the app doesn't allow me to go further. I personally feel it's a waste of money. Don't take any services from this app. Local Parlor are much convenient than UC.
Very good app. Well trained persons. Good service is what you get in end.
Urban clap again cancelled my salon booking...and this 4th time in a row..they said professional not available..but you know truth is that when u placed booking of less than 1000 or 800 their professional are never avl...but if you place order of 1500-2000 , their all professionals are avl.. In short if you want urban clap Salom service for women ,you have to place booking of high amount.. Really a very bad experience from urban clap regarding salon service
loved it
The app has very limited service area coverage. Hence it is of no help
Very bad experience using plumber service. Coatation much more. You get extra service, amount is same in the app. Recommend : user can add more service before and after service start.
Very bad experience since last 2 days I tried to contact them about my booking they rescheduled my booking and due to unavailability of professionals they cancelled it.I paid them online but my refund will come after 5 to 6 working days. I suffer lot due to bad service
Very good service and very good manner
First time iam editing a review..these ppl have become very money minded and some are unprofessional too..they don't give proper information and some professionals r rude too..they r charging extra 50/- for every schedule and we need to wait for the customer care ppl to call and resolve it and simple they say they will refund it to the app so that we can use it later which is nuisance
Booked electrician two times, they assign slot without confirming with the electrician. By the time need is exhausted they will call for re scheduling, this has become common practice. They will deduct the cancellation charges. Also, refund will take more than 9 days which should have been instant. Never going to avail this service again. Calling customer support is a must option which is missing.
Bathroom cleaning and any service related to bathroom is never done. This company booking is confirmed and finally professional did not arrives and one more thing if I rescheduled it then I have to pay Rs 50/- extra and what if company cancel it then only paid amount is refunded..why is that so , the company should pay the compensation to customer for their time
Good experience
No way you can contact customer service or have any option to get a call back from them. Frustrating. My wallet balance becomes zero after 10days, what nonsense.
Good
No one from customer care ever replies.
Excellent
This happen third time in a row.no professional assigned on schedule time.we are wasting our time to book every time.request to other check above comment before booking.everytime our weekend vanish due to unprofessional behaviour of urban company.dont understand how company mistake three times in a row.
Minus 5 star. Take advance charges, then no service appears. After that they give refund after 7 days. Smart way to con people
excellent
Worst company ever. No contact number given or no way to contact the company or customer care incase of emergency or any issue. Not real professional company. My issue is not at all solved so far and no reply from customer care. They only make fool of people. I will never ever recommend this to anybody. What a FAKE COMPANY it is.. this company should change its name to FAKE COMPANY from URBAN COMPANY. PATHETIC and WORSTEST COMPANY EVER SEEN.
I paid for Plus membership in Nov 21 but now it's showing I m not Plus member buy again..I already bought yearly membership
Bakawas service
Lots of improvement in application required. Service men are best
Very good job
Awesome experiences given by UrbanClap. But after update yesterday on the payment page it's not opening. Several times I tried to open the payment page to book appointment but still the same issue, it's loading..... loading... & again loading. Request you to please look into this matter.
These beauticians are not at all profesional. They accept and don't show up at end and give a very bad reason like I am going to village I can't come. I don't understand why they accept if they can't come. Even auto assigned beauticians also are not good . They give some excuses and either will come 1 hour late or will make you to reschedule. Very few are good and professional. They take high charge so at least they should maintain a high quality and customer satisfaction service.
Highly unprofessional service . They cancel the bookings last minute , so don't trust them if they complete the service
good
Worst app... never does what they promise. Didn't find anyone responsible here.. they just throw a sorry always.. finally customer has to cancel.. work will not be done.. time waste in booking with this.. Go for some other service app..
excellent
You have cleaned my mattresses well and I enjoy talking to you. Your urban company has become very famous all over India.
I downloaded the app and booked for kitchen cleaning for rs 699, final amount was 699 + 50 =749. The booking was done and a professional was assigned. I tried to reach out to him on both the numbers provided but it didnt connect. I waited but still the same. No support is being given. Could not cook too for the day as for the high hopes that someone from this app would arrive. Worst experience ever with this app for me. Just took my money, full scam.
A very handy service provider. They have good services and solutions for every need.
Urban company fraud ha
I don't want giving a single star , Because yeh company bekar he or in log ke under jo kaam kar rahe woh log bhi achhe nehi he or in log dikhate ek paisa or lete kuch or ,inlog bolte company wale ko alag dena or jo kaam karne ke liye ate he un logo ko alag dena ek broken tap feeting ke liye company wale 200 or ake kaam karne wale 250 le liye or upar se company wale ko diya bole the hum logo ke sath jhagada karte achhe nehi in log please koi bhi urban company ka help mat lo I request everyone
Urvi Gohil is very calm and friendly.provide great service...I have pleasent experience. Neat and clean as well as satisfied work...thank you dear urvi and thank you urban company
Being cheated money was paid & they denied
The app is super complicated. You will not know what service comes under what head. They send electricians for plumbing problems. What a service. Top of it, Customer support team is extremely pathetic, they cut the call on your face and says do what ever you want to. Shameless creatures.
very good
Excellent contractor provided for Painting
There is no customer care number.
Professionals are being very unprofessional. No customer care service number
the service was really good. agent Afreen is professional and good at her job. I recommend her
There is no quality control of the contractors/ technicians. Technician quoted me a bill of 1200 for a part that only cost 200.
Couldn't find single plumber in city and left me hanging for two days
very good
Too much cost
Very professional and very helpfull thank you urban clap
I have made a booking for a service. Now I try to check the details I am not able to see the booking. There is no customer service number to reach out to as well.
Most unprofessional service. They will accept booking but cant assign the person as per the slot. This happend to me almost everytime. Plus they does not bother about about the damage if professional breaks anything. Their professionals are cheating customers. They also charge cancellation fees to cuastomers when they are unable to provide service. Now why my bookings are not showing in the app ? Most faltu app and service
Refund which is credited as uc credits cannot be used all at once but only a max of 30 which the cust care did not tell. Me before refunding , v disappointing , not at all customer friendly service
Excellent
The company service can be described in only one word - Pathetic
Pathetic work and coordinator. No proper clarity for service scope even paying for complete house cleaning.asking extra money for small small work
good service..
Excellent service üëç
ok good
I wanted to give negative rating, but there Is no option. My request to all the people who are thinking of downloading this app, PLEASE DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS APP for electrician purpose. Their technician are fraudster will charge you more money take the faulty product along with the money and won't comeback. Won't lift the calls and get disappeared.Which even their customerservice can trace. It's better to take little stress of finding a local technician near home, Atleast you know the person
Sapna Kashyap Took booking and did not turn up. She was too rude. Till date i liked urban company now its TOTAL FAILiURE
good technicians
Great Service üëçüëç
Good experience, they were there at time, they have a nice service, polite, very clean, definitely I would recommend..
my experience was very good
good job done
A.c and bathroom cleaning both of them did their job nicely professionally ,they reached on time.
Good

The service of the therapist amazing. But about timing schedule very very disappointed, always late
G√≤oooood
In Dubai- the service is pathetic. It was quite good in India- but don't waste your time on it in Dubai.
üéÇ
very underrated app, it deserves a lot more appreciation than it get. A must try app. love it
Really disappointed with the service from Urban Company.. Customers completely rely on your service based on scheduled date and time.. but on time we get to know that no professional is available.. Worst thing for a customer... I have bought a membership as well and even after paying in advance we get this kind of disappointment..
excellent service
Extreme slow app
Prompt and professional service but certainly at a premium :)
Pathetic service..
great
Horrible Service!! Pathetic! They don't deliver on the work, they don't provide service and the pricing are no less either. Their so called 'professionalls' are highly unprofessional who are late and just cancel service at their will.
Disgusting service and customer care. Pathetic service. Diteched me at last moment and didn't even initiate refund yet.
UI makes no sense. Pls have a better experience
Initially it was good but now the service is too bad. Professional do not arrive on time and don't pick the call. Customer care executives do not take any action against the professionals. Recently, they started charging for cancelation and rescheduling. If the problem from their end, then no discount will be provided to the customer.
On app forced to pay money for UC subscription. Want to cancel UC subscription. UC Contact center help team refused to refund the UC membership fee.hence giving poor ratings of the app
Maintain proper customer care service ..as a customer if people are facing any issue with technicians there is no proper point of contact here ..we keep on make follow up calls and messages with technician on top of that u guys will give worst service which is to be remembered .. please improve ur customer care service ...
satisfied
Good company
Good...üëç
I haven't got the required service on time, they keep on rescheduling almost upto one month. Disgusting experience also taken advance and no option of refunding
Horrible App. If you want a service and book a appointment and time slot. Service is rescheduled as per agent convince. Absolutely useless app. I would have not raised this issue but I faced problem twice. Horrible experience.
Good
very good service
Super bakwash Time pe kabhi bhi aate nahi Hamesha time change karte rahte hai Pahle aap ko batnge nhi Time pe phone kar k
Never Use Urban Company Service. It's just a froud company. If anyone is looking for cleaning service please don't book üôè They damage things & give false commitments of replacement! I had huge loss because of their unskilled workers! So please don't trust them at any cost.
Dealing with very unprofessional people. Doesn't have respect for our time. Stopped using this
Tracking a technician is like impossible and customer service doesn't respond to your calls and my services request is still open. I am still waiting
We had to pay online a large amount before the service and it was difficult as we dont have any card to pay and cash to be given after service option was not available.
Satisfied with the service vinni is very professional
Excellent Service
Difficult to book any service, 1 out of 10 is successful. Reinstalled the app then too same issue
Worst company... Added charges are more than the work charges.
No service
Very bad experience Lost 3600/-on washing machine repair cost, washing machine problem same Untrained professional cheats the coustomer
They are still working on my query since the last 7 days and that's what the developer responded .. lol.. Pathethic cs team and the sad part is that the customer has to follow up instead of them ..the application is horrible.. not recommended at all since first time customers are treated in this manner
ok.sure
Tech issues with app not getting resolved. Been complaining.
Extremely professional and competent persons
No of Options tooooo many. Just to book a normal hair cut, you have to do so many steps and keep avoiding ticks to pay more. App is taking shape of Selling than Customwr ease
I had hired two beauticians from this app. They were not trained enough . When i wanted to rate them on the app, it was not uploaded.
Very bad app
Your scheduling is of no use as the reschedule happens automatically behind the scenes. I booked for Saturday morning and the booking status now shows as Sunday evening, pathetic service.
I had paid the complete amount & running after you people for the bad work done. You people are simply ignoring. U people call us over phone & there after there is no further action. I had never expected this kind of attitude from UC.
I wanted to change my feedback and rating in one case . The app does not have any option to do that . After that I contacted helpdesk not once but 3 -4 times in one week and none of them knew how to do it . They kept saying it's a tech problem and someone will get back in 24 hours . They refuse to escalate the issue to senior managers . So even after 7 days I have not got any call or message from tech team or from senior mngt .Nor has the problem been resolved .I have stopped using UC completely
Booked Haircut and Got Cancelled from Urban Clap almost 4 months now didn't got refund. MY FIRST AND LAST BOOKING ON URBAN CLAP. KEEPING AAP JUST TO JUST TO GET REFUND OTHERWISE I MUST HAVE DELETED TILL NOW. Also unable to give star rating in minus
Diwali time your service is very poor. Especially you are not responding the customer properly This is very bad experience. Now I will not interested at the time of diwali.
The person doing the cleaning services absolutely took all the safety norms in to account. To be mentioned, the personnel had also carried her own sitting tool. This is really commendable as it's difficult to load the tool n all heavy essentials on the back n travel distances. Hats of to their effort n services. Safety to all, safety to self.
Excellent service.Decent behaviour
Excellent
Pathetic app... Is not getting install also üòÑ
Reduce the price
Availed of Painting service in Mumbai as strongly recommded By a close friend. The surveyor (Sales) promised the moon. Cost was 35% less than Asian Paints. The topmost reason to go for it was - final job completed OTP was in my control. Work started as scheduled. Packaging of household items was bad. The painting contractor did nothing. The call center executive did not reslove. The painter spoke bad words when questioned about quality of work. This ended my all expectations.
The plumber cheated me. Don't recommend this app
I miss an easy way to contact customer service executive, in case of any query or doubt during the works. Also, many times I needed certain services customised to my requirement but do not find the option in the app. In such cases too, a customer service desk will be very helpful.
Pathetic issue resolution methodology and zero customer care support. Service personal cancel bookings on their own whims. Quality of service is also dismal. Professional are deputed without full equipments. Very sad. Need for some other substitute to UC.
Lootane wala company hai
They are very professional and excellent job done
Service getting poor day by day as Urban Company has no control over their technicians.. After booking you can not expect technicians visit in your scheduled time..
Trash app, spams sms
Don't have customer support number. Don't even care to call customer when the professional is not assigned. Just waste of money and time. Lately your servit is getting worst.
I used to be regular customer of urban clap but now whenever I try to book any service they don't have any personnel to do it. Highly frustrating.
Great Service
For the third time it has happened that the person has not come for service. And this is after paying for it online. All that happens is that the next day someone from customer service calls to say sorry ma'am I'm so deeply apologetic, this will never happen again etc etc. And it always happens again. Please don't bother with these people.
Carpenters are charging exorbitant charge for servicesnot listed, we had a problem with main door not closing. For normal it is Rs 169 since main door is not listed he is charging Rs 350 and it must be the lowest is carpentry
Pathetic service.... They come home decline service saying they can't do it and then they charged me for cancellation...
Excellent service provided. Looking forward for the next serve.
Company cheated me. I request several times on Company email id, but no body response. And my issue not resolved yet. Please respond and resolve my issue.
Urban company is the dummy show only not the real services, two bookings was not fulfilled by them for two consecutive days and while opting the booking they have auto added the membership and we paid for the whole booking and they are not refunding the full amount they have returned only partial amount not the membership amount they have addded with the order so they are so irresposible and not cares of your time , stay away from these irresponsible company
Cheat and loot money. Do not buy membership too. I booked service for next day. They failed to assign professional. 2 days later they assigned one professional at 10:30Am. 1 hour later 11:30Am I got call from assigned person saying he won't come. What a disgrace service. Taking money, failing to give promised service. That's too for someone who purchased UC membership & all free mental Torture to run after UC customer care. Edit: mailed them. Again waste of time. More mental torture
Urban company doesn't have professional two time technician visited to my house for geyser repair he put local third class spare part which doest run 15days even though ihave complan but no response third class waste urban company iwill recommend to others not to use this urban company for any home repairs waste of time and money
Excellent
Pathetic service, waste of time and money.
Nice
Very good and convenient
Good & timely response and service. I am a regular user and recommend UC highly.
Excellent Service from Consultant Praneeth and the Painting Supervisors Manjoor and Hussain and the Team. Excellent Service from Urban Clap Professionals with good quality maintenance
I love the convenience the app has provided
Happy with the service provided. Thank you UC.
Urban company is very nice company giving very good service.
Pathectic App and company. There is no way to reach out to service center. They change booked timings last minute as per their convience. My booking has been changed 3rd time without consultation. Horrible company, think that people have all the time in world to adjust as per their slots. No customer care available to raise concern.
Simply Superb..
Reschedules last minute. Unreliable.. Find another company. Trust me. Booked 4 days in advance.. They canceled and rebooked twice and then at the rescheduled time, they call and say nobody is coming....
Too expensive...
Useful
Why there is no service of urban company for ladies in Patna(RPS more)?Its always saying Unfortunately we don't have any professional available to serve you right now.
Get Easy & Helpful Solution for All ur Needs . Nice App
Not able to sign in or book a service on my Note 10 & S21 Ultra. not sure if its a glitch with samsung devices or android
Worst experience, Expert did not reach the location as scheduled and my service was rescheduled with out my acknowledgment as per there wish. How rude this would be and no courtesy at all. It's just waste of valuable time....
Good
Work wasnt up to mark
Good services and stable app.
Great and reliable service.
Unsatisfactory services...
Fraud company cheater,repaired my tv set from uc, a months after expiring warranty service(3 months warranty)the tv panel start degrading and a black screen showing in top of the tv set,never expected this type of service,,,
nice job good....satisfied
Good app and experience
Good service
Reschedule booking without asking.
Resolved it
Awesome it's great
It's really great company bringing lot of professionalism and benefitting skilled workers in unorganised sector.
super fast and satisfactory service. loved it.
Terrible experience. No professional was assigned for the task and nobody calls back to update on the status of the assignment. I had to cancel twice in the same week. They just respond over mail saying they'll give a call back but don't. Incase nobody is assigned they automatically reschedule it for a different time.
‚ù§Ô∏è
People that they've sent have always been professional
Quite Bad experience with television service. Service guy name was Navi I ,he told that he replaced all the led backlit with new one. But after 5 month, i got same issue where i got to know that backlit might be not replaced with new one. Now service guy dont attend the call ,even not get any response from urban clap. Now i can't rate the service guy,even cant give any feedback on app . It seems Urban company service rating is not upto mark where you cant share your experience after a while.
Nice experience
excellent cleaning service. Highly recommendable.
very well service
Srikanth and their team are doing well their job ...perfectly üëè
So lucky to read all the negative reviews here, I nearly book a cleaning service... Will avoid it at all costs
Good staff and excellent service.
excellent service.
Professionals are really good, only problem is with the app the new changes that they have made are miserable and are not user friendly at all.
Very poor service and response from company in Kanpur Nagar U.P
Very good üòä
Worst service. Looting public
Professional named krithiga was assigned for my service at home for 6:30 pm .she didnt showed up till 6:40 n when I called her at 6:48 pm she directly said she cannot come n to canel the booking . I have booked it for a function to attend tmrw now at last moment it's cancelled.worst service n highly unprofessional behavoiur .
UC has upgraded it's quality a lot, there are amazing technicians for spa and salon... Though my experience some time back for cleaning was not good, but I would love to try it again now... Keep up the good work and providing us hassle free service at home... Thank You
very well and trained professional...excellentservice happy me...
Worest customer service
Very good service
Really pathetic service experience each day they deteriorating experiencing myself ....premium price for substanard professional and services just waste of time and money ...
The customer support is unable to help in many cases. The refund does not get credited timely and the last minute cancellation of services by professional is extremely disappointing. The customer support on top was speaking rudely and loudly and simply said (WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING) now and asked me to enquire about the refund status from Paytm on my own. Ridiculous behaviour!
Best home service app.
Very bad and service
good work
Difficult to rebook same professional and get connected to customer care representative
Yoga catagory kab start hogi.
Service is of Good Quantity.
I just love this app ..things are more easier now specially for women Thank you Urban clap !
Horrible experience.. Worst cleaning service providers ever. Stay away! My appointment was at 2 PM, then after 2:15 PM I got a message stating that it was rescheduled to 4 PM although when I called the service provider at 2 PM he said he will be at my location in 10 minutes!!.. Most unprofessional service I have ever experienced
It's a very helpful app.... 100 problem and 1 solutions üëçüëç
Pathetic
Good team work & reasonably priced.
Worst experience ever Very unprofessional
Good service
easy and fast, professional team
very good job üëç
Charges to be reviewed. Bit high.
i had a terrible experience. i waited for the professional from last 5 days. customer service representative helped me for 3 days and then no call nothing .so i had to cancel after waiting for so much time. seriously terrible üòî
Good But they should take reliable non money minded persons
Worst application even worst customer service i booked service for first tym and then also i need to rescheduled itfor 3 times then also the person said he dont come inthat area and at the time of refund they cut my half booking money
AC technician thef t my house mother board and remote cash not responsible for urban company employees and urban company
The most usefull app of all
Today was the fourth time there was no professional assigned for the scheduled booking. They don't value your time. What has happened to Urban company?
What is this convenience fee for? Training and support, safety assistance? Can you be more vague about what this extra money you're charging for? Rs50 per service is a lot of money to charge in the name of support and convenience. This should be already included in my 500rs haircut! Unethical business tactics.
I'm waiting for urban customer people call but they are very careless and useless always fail to solve the issue and always takes time till.now no one called.me my issue is still pending
West west west west west
They false claim that they provide makeup artist in Mumbai. They don't give any option to book same also on their app no where customer care email I'd or contact number mentioned. Very poor in service.
Have to give one star because there is no way to give feedback otherwise. Such a pathetic company. I booked saloon services. I booked beauty services a day before and it was confirmed.Then the same day around the time of appointment their executive called to tell they can't arrange appointment. What concern more is they ask and.confirm appointment time slots themselves then y they can't provide service. And if customer cancel appointment they are charged rs. 50 as fees. But what if company doit
This is a fraud app which I won't recommend to anyone to anyone they are worse than ola when you book them The urban company as well as the employees that they book for the service don't care about you at all you at all they just call you and give you excuses that they can't deliver the service on time as committed and then they Keep on giving You dates and they don't even bother to compensate for this problem it's like the customers are a joke to them andAnd they don't need business at all.
Bad Service . .Cleaning guy not reached despite appointment
3 months before my Toshiba TV was not operating I call Urban Company make a booking next day one fat guy called Sanjeeb Singha from Urban company came after checking he said if repaired from Urban it will charge Rs 5000 and if he repaired personally he will charge Rs 4000 so he insisted to do the job from him, I did that after 3 months the TV again not working, this time when I called him several times he not responding, this type of people are basically cheater earn money by good company name.
* You need to upload the exact process of the cleaning, so as to know if Executive is working properly * Explain if only top of BED or SOFA will be cleaned
Loved the experience

Poor service
There is no kannada language option in the app.... there is only hindi and english
Worst app not able to book any service also they dont hav cust care no and on email they dont reply

Horrible Services

Most irrational charging... Asking Rs 1500 over booking charge of Rs. 398/- for repairing a tact button of a microwave machine.
Worst workers, they made me cancel booking and did offline work , charged 7500 rupees . They did floor dirty by using chemicals. After they didn't lift my phone calls.
Very unhappy with the app after booking my slot whenever i am going to proceed to pay option nothing is happening...i tried updating n reinstalling as well many times but waste of time ...now i m just gonna uninstall this app.

I booked for Sofa Cleaning around 9am. Scheduled at 5.30pm. Around 5pm I was called and asking for rescheduling. This is very unprofessional. Someone from UB callcentre told the same thing with few sorries But unable to send someone.And to my utter surprise I got a message that I will be charged for canceling. When the cancelation was made by Urban Company. Hope a long life for Urban Co.
Worst experience ... I booked a scheduled for beautician but it's more than an hour to my scheduled time but still no person has been appointed to provide me service.....even the helpline number is too busy. Would like to rate it 0 out of 5
Very poorly designed and restrictive. No customer service number found.
v helpful app
What's wrong with you ? If you cannot find a professional, Why did you accept the booking? And why are you not calling me and informing me about delay. WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. You cannot become a successful start-up with this low level of customer service.
great service
These guys are a rip off too. Priced too high with no one to manage the exuberant pricing. Like no supervisor to validate pricing. That's the issue with these big compnaies. They rob you professionally like over charge you with bling.
Service quality has degraded now. Even no direct nos to call. Service provider refuse to give service.
very nice
nice service
Excellent service.
Veena is excellent in her work I really like her work
No option to call customer care
No earphone cleaners available soo disappointed by your services Hope you improve your professionals
good service at the time of everyone s need
Dear customer provider I request you to do an immediate call in my contact number. There is a big problem for us because you have no customer service number.
Happy with the service
The urban company partner supportive person mr Aakash kasera and kunal srivastava Crossed the limits of conspiracy and because of.....

Excellent service providers. Very professional. Reasonable rates. Courteous staff. Easy to use app
nice
good & efficient service of ultra fresh chimney done today on 17 November
No professional was assigned even after the desired time.had to go to walk in salon after waiting so long for urban company's beautician.poor experience
I regret buying the plus membership. App doesn't even allow to book an appointment after the latest update. All I get is a blank screen when I try to select address and slot. Even when the app works, there are almost always no slots available for basic carpentry and plumbing requirements. Looks like they ran out of partners, so the plus membership is a total waste of money now.
Hav been using Urban company for a while. Great experience always.
Excellent
Best service
Not able to add address to place order
I booked washroom cleaning service for 3 washroom and when the person arrived he said he doesn't Clean office washroom whereas it's not mentioned in the app that they don't clean commercial washroom :) deleting this app.
Best for any services. must recommend
Very good..
Very poor service
amount is high
I booked for uninstalling the Split AC n for installation the same 10 days back.Technician came after seeing width of wall said he can't do the job.asked me to cancel.

Good app amazing service.
Carpenter visited and gave a quote as promised by UC
very bad experience...once I got burnt during waxing and the other time they just cancelled my booking and rescheduled for next day ...very bad service ..very disappointed
Very poor job
If you are providing service, then you should make reaching out to customer support easy. I had doubts regarding what the service includes but it's impossible to reach out to customer support. Hence giving 1 star review. Key to successful business is earning trust of your customers and making sure they are not facing any issues. Look at Amazon for e.g. they make reaching out to them so easy that even if I have to pay extra for product I'm happy to do it.
He is nicely completed his task
Awesome app. Due to covid ppl can't go to salon we can use this app. The pll r very professional maintain hygiene. Wering mask and gloves every time. Friends go for this wonderful appü•∞üòò
urban clap services are prompt and the personnels are very polite and professional.But the options to choose for respective services are not very clear.Like for example I just wanted to change some plugs of my table and standing lamps,I couldn't find a suitable option for the same. With the carpenter service.as per the option 2 nails to hang any decor is 69‚Çπ I chose √ó4 which means 8 nails and I presumed that I was charged for 8 nails.Carpenter after his work told me that each nail was 69‚Çπ.
Very good app. Received perfect service on the appointed day.
Worst app ever
High level unprofessional. Waste of money
This was the 3rd time I have done my washing machine repairing from the urban company and the experience was awful. They every time come do the things and take money and after 2 days again the same problem I faced it . As there is no after call facilities from this site .request officials to take a necessary action against my complaint.
Improperly managed by the Coord team. The professionals are poorly communicated and some smart ones take advantage of this. The customer care have inadequate knowledge on the rwquiewments of the customers and the The services as indicated in the app are shades of lipstick and not actual prints of the services provided. I have gone through a process of repeated rescheduling of services for seven times due to poor Coordination and delegation by the backend of the company.
Their advertising is misleading and fraudulent. They do not serve what they advertise.
there is no option of customization
I want to book a house cleaning service and have some queries around it but I see no customer support number or chat option in the app. Also after reading the reviews I have second thoughts to book a service from urban company.
Urbanclap actually has allowed many people to relax and not be bothered by going to the parlour and their long waitings. The beauticians who work in urbanclap are highly trained and are very professional and dedicated to their work. They do their work very neatly and patiently. The service provided by them is quite satisfying and under one's budget also. So happy to know Urban Company home salon services are done with all safety measures in place!
very happy
good
very good service
Very bad experience professional not assaigned...
No way to contact customer care
really excellent job he did,fully satisfied with his job thanq urban company
Awesome Services.
Very good app
not prompt like earlier
i dont like this company
I think yeah compony ke paas koi professional hair cut wala he hi nahi ...do din se resedual time kiya fir refund kiya ..aur woh bhi 5 din me aayega ...pls don't use this app..
Vgood
This app is really disgusting and pathetic. It has only one option to reschedule. Their customer service people and management are helpless. The attitude of a technician is just on another level. I had booked parlour service 3 times for 3 different occasion but everytime it got reschedule and after that they never turned up. I wanted to give minus rating but unfortunately it's not there. I will make sure no one known to me books any service for this useless app. Deactivating it right away !!
Just perfect service.When i am book my salon at home for first time i'm scared but when i'll experience the service i'm fully satisfied with the beautician shilpa... I just love the service she given to me facial and massage just stress free and relaxed.....
Prompt service
Technician is very polite.. and recieved a very good service..
Nice service
Easy to use
perfect
awesome service Nd speed
Worst app deny for service at end time
Good app
Please not download this application because they not provide good service. Be aware not download this application
No service availble in Dasna, Ghaziabad
Don't use this application all professionals are just looters
Professional and trained staff, well behaved and hygienic
This App take booking but no one is assigned......very bad service fake promise ..waited for 2 days
Service canceled from ur end n its been more than 15 days there is no refund and there is no answer from company ...its really pathetic ...I msgd n mailed also but no reply
No proper customer service, none calls back after reporting a complaint. Membership is of no use, Technicians are not available most of the time. Technicians keep on rescheduling the services. Encountered Unprofessional technicians all the time.
very professional.. I like there every services.
Very good always. Why don't you guys provide hourly basis driver and maid rental services as well ? Your costs are reasonable and genuine people are provided always
She has a really good hand. very satisfied
If the technician/service person turns out to be good then it will be overall a good experience and the app allows to give feedback etc. By chance if the service person turns rude or not follow the rate card shared in their own app then customer is left helpless. Absolutely no provision to call for help or raise complaints with customer care. We are finally left at the mercy of the technician. App needs to have chat Box for complaints and feedback option even if service had to be cancelled.
No updates on the stolen goods since 15 days...beware for 1000 services can end up paying ur expensive bun attented things...people just take away goods in their big bags while u go to washroom of when y apply face pack...no reply you cheaters...no reply yet...written 100 mails no resolution
Excellent but cost is higher
Very bad experience, I'll not suggest anybody
It's not that easy to contact customer care about perticular service
Worst . I have paid for platinum service 2 days before schedule time .I have scheduled at 9 AM and they told they wouldn't be able to make it today after 9 am.
Good service,Punctual,Professional
No option to contact customer support directlly if someone has non booking related issues. Cant opt multiple services at once with same category too such as Hair spa with hair cutting n styling or any grooming service And when we are subscribed to memebership it was not clarified that there should be a minimum booking amount. I mean WTH guys.üò°üò°ü§¶
Awesome
In our society they don't provide services. Which is very bad.
Inspite of being UC plus member there is no added advantage offered. I had taken Air purifier service but post service noise issue occured (which was not there earlier) n for the same I raised a complaint but no action has been taken even after a week, although they claim UC warranty, but it's useless. In Urban Company nobody bothers to respond back. Pathetic customer support. Highly disappointed.
Not good service
FRAUD.........They don't take ownership for their services which is the very basis of their platform....
Dear service provider, I request an immediate call back from you to address some issue on priority... There is no customer care number where I can connect.... Can't someone call back, it is that tough to call back when user is requesting for a call to resolve some issues. After requesting for call back on 4th November I received a call on 14th Nov, Wow!.... And that too yet the issue has not been solved and was promised that someone will be in touch with a solution to it. ü§∑
I would rate it 5* but the customer service is very bad, no one aswered
Money deducted, no professional visit and no one responding to call back request
The worst cleaning company, the lady came snd cleaned my house and broke my vaccum cleaner hose. Also her boss didnt come to pick her up right away. She was just sitting and waiting for him for almost an hour. So unprofessional
great
Very bad service
Excellent job
Very good
Good experience!
Excellent
The Plumber cancelled the first appointment without informing us. Then the second time we booked an appointment, the plumber calls and says he will only try to come at the scheduled time because the distance is too far. Such unprofessional and irresponsible behavior is extremely disappointing and we don't think we want to avail services from Urban Company anymore.
Promised service given!
Fantastic experience
Third class app. One page is routing to another for finding geyser repair ...but could find it.
I have had one experience so far, which was really good.
Service was delayed by more than 2:30 hours.Still no show up. If customer cancels after assignment they charge you, but if there is any mistake from the company side like gigantic delay or etc. no policy to compensate the customer. Disappointed.
The urban company service is day by day getting worse.. I'm tired of writing email and complains.The customer care executive are the worse. They don't know how the process work, whats happening in the applicstion. They say just one line"Sorry for the inconvenience" but we will not provide solution.Idk why you guys option for rescheduling? The customer care call and asking that's glitch we can't reschedule your service.. paying for my service they talk like they proving the service for free.
Nice service, technician is polite
My goto app for many services. I think as a next step, UC should partner with consumer durable companies and provide repair replacements like switch, sockets, bulbs, LEDs etc from the app as a service itself. Saving the customers from stepping out for these replacements. This will be the next step in my experience atleast :)
Highly unreliable app. There is no guarantee that the professional assigned knows how to do work, nor is there a guarantee that he will show up for work. Ask your local supplier to send a person rather than wasting your time with these guys.
Most average not worth it at all
Overall experience was pathetic, services provided by Indurti Saibabu and Devi are absmyl and made me to think twice to opt Urban company services
Awesome work
Best service
best services
Pathetic services. No backbone to resolve the mess created. Customer services are hell mess. No control over professionals. My mistake, I should look for local vendors instead of your services. You people have deprived my family from drinking water supply in my own house... Just one word: BLOODY ROGUES
good
Happy and satisfied with the service. Thanks UC.
issue is not resolved
Good, must download
very good experience.
Very Worrest service please don't take the service from urban company. They tell something before service and they respond something whe you get complaint after service. Pathetic customer care and service
No customer support if professional doesn't do the service. Professional wasn't picking call. No point of contact from customer support to raise such issues. They keep saying 'request for call back' but nobody calls back Don't use this app
Of late the rates of the UC have become very high. Cancellation are common. UC has no control over cancellations therefore making it unreliable. Last two days trying for a plumber appointment which inspite of being confirmed was not assigned and it was upto me to pursue the customer care. Mr Noman of UC expresssed his helplessness over non acceptance of call by professional. He advised that I cancell the booking. Whereas if you cancel within two hours Rs 50 is charged. Not reliable anymore.
Without customer care the organization which you are running, does it shows trusty for customers? You are showing URBANCLAP giving most valuable and best services then may I know the reason why you are running customer care support? Frankly speaking I want to use your services but feeling insecure that without customer care number, without address of your firm how can I trust you?
Bhut bekar service hai ek Banda Inka same problem k liye bolyega pressure switch kharab hai dusra bolyega inlet kharab hai 3rd Banda bolyega wiring change krwao . Aur company k product se mhanga lgaty hai parts bhi
Very happy with professional services so far
Not working on Android 12.Crashing system UI
I have booked service for apartment cleaning and it was assigned to some vendor. Staff visited my flat and without informing nothing they left. Amount got deducted 499/- and even am unable to contact costumer care
Always the best service. I can give 10 stars if available. Thanks urban company. U r doing a good job.
I would have given negative ratings if there was an option...my last professional was very unprofessional and to make up to that Urban company from their side suggested a free service as per my timings ..then the new professional couldn't agree to that timing since she has a kid...I agreed to adjust to her timing...I was constantly being bombarded with emails, messages etc that the professional will arrive on time But on the dotted time her tracking was not available, she refused to answer the
Very unprofessional attitude.they do not respect other's time.After waiting soo long,one person assigned and he denied booking just 30 mins before. Very dissatisfied
Very polite and a thorough professional. God Bless Him. And thank you, Urban Clap.
good
Firstly I don't know how did this app got 4.6 rated, Secondly worst service from their so called executives , they are very very unprofessional and don't know how to talk to a customer and on top of that when you cancel their "Gunda" Customer care executive will call you and start talking to you in a rude voice and wouldn't listen to any of your concerns... i seriously will never install or use this app ever in my life and i would recommend you guys to go with the local services in your area.
Fantastic work done
Best app
Worst supports tried reaching many times they dnt respond
I had very bad experience in tv service Without knowing model cancelled the booking by technician due to the distance (tambaram west)
I opted for Pay after service..based on the customers feedback. Once the work is completed..ask the person to generate invoice and then pay online...I am satisfied with the service..."Sofa cleaning"...let's be practical the sofas will be clean and neat.....not brand new as we purchased
Had extremely bad experience with a barber so much so that due to freak accident i had to visit an opthalmologist ( traumatic hyphema due to faulty trimmer that shooted hairs from my beard to my eye) , called sos helpline twice only to meet a soothing calming tone... I was calling sos helpline to instruct the barber to leave my home as i was on way to my opthalmologist. I request uc to improve customer support.

Waste app in that services are not good dont go into dis app, Urban company you have to change the reviews option, for edit, look into this and language problem also service persons arguing for rating of full, very expensive also
Very bad service, water leakage is not stopped.
It has been completely fabulous having service given by urban company in various form of required attempts wit perfect proffesionals, all proffesionals that had been sent at home service has followed every single guidelines of covid throughout the service. Fantastic way of providing home service so easy to get it done in few seconds .. very very happy guy u must try this app Nd it's service..
Why should I prefer Urban company If I am not getting service in my area

My mom and I love the service of urban company.
Excellent service ...... Fantastic work ... üëçüëçüòä
Kim was very good and quick
Used many of the services while moving to new house. Very helpful and professional. Absolutely convenient and efficient. Recommend the installation, cleaning andsalon services.
Booked for deep cleaning an empty villa and and the guy calls up and says that I need to pay extra as the booking i did was for empty apartment. And, there is no option as Empty villa in the app. This is a big confusion at the last moment and the urban clap professional who was there on the call to discuss about my complaint was of no help as she said either I need to accept the charges what the partner is saying which is too much for an empty villa or cacell the booking. So unprofessional.
I use this app for my car wash..it was worth money spent nd the cleaning professional was very very good in his work . Highly recommend the foam and interior wash..
Good Professionals r hired for working...dedicated and disciplined.
Washroom cleaning should be consider one, including all the attachments being a combined toilet basin and bath area and few other things which are present in washroom (gyser, window glass etc.)
Professional and thorough service
Worst service The partner is not coming. He advised to me. you reschedule the service. The partners are not coming & not contacting to the customers And most worst thing he canceled my service& deducted 300 rupees in refund
Didn't assign a professional for the longest time, didn't bother to intimidate as well. Bad experience
Good service !
Fascinating facilities for modern day Manz relief
Bathroom has cleaned very nicely. He has good experience in cleaning Bath rooms. I am very happy with his service.
Very good
pricing is very expensive
Pathetic services...the people are never on time ..they want to cancel when ever they want...will definitely not advice to take the service from Urban company..üëéüëé
Just disappointed. They informed me just one hour before the booking time that they can't connect with a professional. But I booked 3 days ago. Too much disappointed.
Awesome
good app
Today I had booked an appointment for meni pedi and then firstly the professional cancels then urban company cannot even assign any other professional and that lead to last minute cancelation of service which was already paid for and made in advance. Unreliable service provider for sure. And this has happened with me multiple times in UC.
Pathetic service, I availed washing machine repair service in July, the person informed that it would cost Rs 3200 as the PCB board had gone bad and I asked him to repair it. Just after 3 months, the board went bad again and I was informed that it would cost Rs 3200 again to repair it. I would strongly urge your not to use Urban Company for any of the services or repairs. I would give you zero stars if that option was available.
I'm fully satisfied... thanks urban company to giving me this wonderful opportunity
Quality of service is not as per the cost
Good
excellent
good
Excellent service provided for the LED repair which otherwise i thought would need to be replaced
very good
revolutuon in service industry...
service was good
Wrost services and unprofessional employees not come on time
Cancelled the water purifier service as technician called and said parts not available, why cancellation charges....
I understand it is newly started in Mysore. Deep cleaning of bathroom done meticulously. Many services taken in Mumbai earlier were very nicely executed.
My allotted time for bathroom cleaning is today 3:30pm, but now the time is 4pm. If we want to reschedule from our side you will charge extra 50 RS. But now from your side you are rescheduling(till now the person is not allotted ) and not even intimating, now will you reduce the amount by 50 RS. Very pathetic service you have.. already charged my whole amount.. such an ugly service I never seen..
Pathetic pest control done by super fine pest control need to complaint please provide the number or mail id to complaint chasing since 1 month to redo the same
Trying from 3 days, no technician are available in pune city. no slot are available in pune city for gyser repair. No optipn provided to book different slots.
Worst service ever, all the good ratings are fake and fraud. They are not at all true to their words, delay the service, if the executive can't reach on time why the he'll their is slot booking system.
Very very poor after service...absolutely pathetic customer care support.
Very poor painting job not satisfactory. No time management. Very very late.
Pathetic service. Jobs left incomplete by the so called professional. No resolution from the urban company team.
Bookings got rescheduled and cancelled without any intimation
services are good , but only good process should get assign for your job, plan in advance as not all services are available in given time...
best professional services..üëç
Till date, I have used their salon service, massage service, kitchen cleaning service, washing machine repair service. Completely satisfied. Their follow up for unsatisfactory service is actually great.
Great service
Gr8 services and they r using good product.
Pathetic service. You people just wasting time. No proper communication. And service person never arrives on time. Many times service person never got appointed. Useless
he was very nice
nice
satisfied with the bathroom cleaning. happy
very good service
definitely go for cleaning did the work well
Don't believe their videos they are nothing like 10x cleaning etc etc... They have NO solution for hard water patches...
Very very bad experience... Professional is not so professional..
so good
Nice service
Good
Pathetic service Frustrated like anything Just delays and delays and no proper customer care support at all .
Cash on delivery is not clearly mentioned
The best company for services delivered at home. The standard of company are exceptionally well.

Very bad
They should add makeup for women category
Best Facial & pedicure done by Renuka. Very relaxing & blissfulüëåüòá üíÉ
Very unhappy there is no early resolution to issues
Worst experience.. inexperienced professionals, no proper response from help centre Happened for the third time..worst service Better if there would be negative rating
nice app... Thanks for lovely app for self grooming,. It's safe and hygienic in this pendamic time..
job well done.
Have used salon at home service for the first time. The professional didn't turn up and requested me to reschedule the appointment. Rescheduled couple of times, the response from the beauticians were terrible. Pathetic service. I would not recommend this!
GREAT EXPERIENCE.THEIR GUY CAME NEXT DAY AND REPAIRED MY WASHING MACHINE.I THINK ALL BAD REVIEWS ARE FAKE.YOU CAN USE IT YOURSELF.
I booked hair cut service I chose 8 o clock slot no body comes on 8 o clock then the company call me and said sorry for inconvenience your booking is rescheduled 10 o clock ok I wait for 10 clock and one more call received from company that we don't have any professional very bad experience they don't know the value of time 1 star bhi Jada hai
Felt issue while payment initaition
Super
so far service obtained through urban company has been good. no complaints.
Professional not assigned on slot time
Looters taken so much of my money without providing the service
Useful
excellent
They don't have beauticians to provide services, I am tired of it.why do you claim that you provide services in Raipur if you don't have enough people who can serve.
Unnecessarily penfing charges added. Required prifessionals not sent. They send unskilled pers & when one cancels booking / return them then they will add pendinding charges... Highly not recomnended 'urban clap'
From last two services urban clap n there hired vendor have highly disappointed me... One was bathroom cleaning which was disaster and next was salon service where agent was booked for waxing n she forgot to carry her wax ... Which again wasted my time like anything... I have a suggestion for urban clap keep a tight eye in ur vendors that u hire ultimately it's ur name that is at stake... Think before u hire
Worst service ever
This is the worst service app ever saw. From last two days I am scheduling appointments and no professional being assigned and appointments keep on postponing. All my money got stuck. Atlast one person was assigned for tomorrow service but again it was cancelled and postponed. This is complete nonsense. Don't ever book anything in this. Unnecessarily I took membership also.
Partner ka khoon choos rhi hai Company
Very good service at affordable price with all safety measures.. Highly recommended
Actually its a good and helping aap for providing services at home. But the beauticians should be better. They are not showing what product they r using.Little more hygiene should be maintained.
I have been UC customer for last five years all the services are good but never opt for the painting services it is very bad.. Pathetic customer service..
Good serviceing person is gd
Excellent service
Its affordable, safe and trusted.
Fantastic service
Good
Charges are already high... Now why are you asking for extra convenience fees... Avoid this fees... We are taking your services it's your convenience, instead pay us convenience fees...
Good
highly disaapointed they just cancel last minute
great
please refrain from misleading billing from Urban Company. they r just befooling customers. N UC stop minting money from customers. really really bad experience
Pedicure was pathetic won't ever take service for pedicure. Doesn't even desreve 1 star. Wastage of money
Disgusting services
Keep up the good work Urban and the therapist Sameena was so polite overall satisfied with the service ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Very useful platform for handyman work
Highly unprofessional..Booked a spa session..She called me 1/2 an hour before just once ...somehow I couldn't pick up...They didn't bother to call me again ...Just cancelled and rescheduled on their own .Pathetic service that too when I have taken their membership....Yes Madam is way better..
nice work done Syed Asif excellent work very professional thanks urban company
Pathetic service..i had taken waterproofing service and they had given 1 year warranty nut within 3 weeks seepage came back and now they are telling me i have to resolve seepage issue on my own...they why in the first place waterproofing was done and what was the warranty for ? They cheat customer...their survey person promise something else and the person who do work say something ..don't believe them .. urban company only cheats customers especially in this field not sure about other services
Very good experience by urban clap
Convenience at its best
Not professional and definately not worth the money
As per expectations
The app not responding moat of the time. It takes forever to get in touch with the team
Scheduling salon services is a nightmare. Spa services are good
The service person did not turn up. Even after rescheduling the technician did not turn up and customer care service is pathetic. They are unable to find the reason. Worst urban company service. Will not recommend to anyone
Service was good. App need some improvement though.
The worst service. They not professionals. Keep on changing schedules. Wast of time and money. Better find some one out side. The worst app
excellent Job Done
Worst experience customer service tries to reschedule the date of service again and again. Wasted whole day while waiting for urban company service
Pathetic service. The technicians always forces addon services and refuses to use existing copper pipe for AC.
So one gets the services at the comfort of their homes from professionals. They maintain all safety measures and the products used are so nice. Quote affordable as well !
all perfect very good service main bahot happy hoon service se main wapis bulana chahungi bahaviour bahot acha tha professional ka...good
Not reached on the given date and there is no communication from Urban company regarding this. Payment is done already.
Very poor when there is offer
Skilled professional
Good service. Never much of a complaint and the service men always make sure to resolve anything pointed out before they finish the Job. Good guys to talk and communicate to, overall a great experience.
The best app for all household services.
Extremely unprofessional....service agent doesn't arrive for service and does not even bother to inform that he is unable to come.
excellent service üëç
I like that work and he told us everything about it and I'm very proud of this app
They reschedule your booking by themselves without informing you
they Will steal your money if you would cancel because they didn't came and provide you the service!!
best service
Good service but if they respect the customer time and no accuracy
Great service by Chanchal and his co technician. 5‚≠ê
Much needed app for House Hold Issues
Not punctual, and never on time,you can expect atleast 2days of delay for so called professional to arrive, if you're the guy who is workless and has no schedules you can use their services, only hair cutting service was good
Worst service and refund policy
Use bathroon cleaning service. Excellent & satisfied work.
Simple services are exorbitant here
Work done Satisfactorily..
Ye apne karmchariyo se bahut kam lete hai or unki aadhi kamayi to yhi rakh lete hai or adhi kamayi apne karamchariyon ko dete hai jisme unka petrol and equipment and material, or bs tbhi tk job dete hai jb tak inke pas demand rahti hai uske bad unhe bina kisi karan ke nikaal deta hai, mere hisab se to mai inhe -5 ya isse bhi kam deta.
Unreliable, pathetic service that doesn't even deserve that one star. The payment went off twice. The helper didn't pitch after 3 hours, doesn't answer calls or whatsapp messages. My email to the company bounced back and the company number on the app does not work. There is no way to contact this company if you have issues. Will never use this company again!!
I would definitely recommend Urban Company for its services. They have affordable prices and all well known services done by professional. I myself have tried last month their beauty service and they came well prepared with sanitizer , mask and used new products which can be used only once. So proper hygeine with proper safety and precautions.
Pathetic service no follow up no alternatives.. Wasted my time. No use of VIP membership. Do not recommend.
User friendly app facilitates almost everything a customer requires.
Was charged extra as adjustment amount
There is no option to pre-book. On weekends it is so hectic that there is no option to book one day before
Providing Unprofessional Beautition... New Beautition are coming for service and unable to rebook favorite Beautition
Perfect
This is for urban company patna....I have scheduled parlour service and everytime it got cancelled saying the beautician was not able to contact you after several attempts...like seriously i think we have a option for msg as well...and then there is no update nothing...customer keep waiting .
Awesome experience
quick service
They don't have any designated customer care number to reach out to. The assigned plumber takes advantages of this fact to fill pockets. If his job done earlier started issues later they deny to fix it and charge I extra stating other reasons.
Good Job
The platform is very useful and user friendly
Worst company to use. I strongly advise against using this company as they do not take responsibility for damages done by their agents. They have ruined my marble in my brand new home and refuse to compensate me for the damages caused by them.
Everything is fine until there is a damage. They will trust their professionals not there long time customers.
UC reschedule the service 4 times, It took almost 15 days to complete the job.
nice
I have taken 3 different services from urban company. Every time they appointed me professional guys with good behaviour, well behaved & skilled person. They are also very prompt on time. Good job urban company.
Worst experience. Equipment in working condition is made handicapped post so called service by UC
First professional didn't provide good service. Wanted to reschedule with new professional but assigning the same one. Not happy with the help center options provided.
Pathetic app . Please do not use this app .they do not assign professionals on time and then when assigned the proffesionals do not turn up .. and ask us to cancell or reschedule waste of time. .... I am never going to use this app ... They do not have a minus rating else would have rated in minus for service
Poor service
Extremely unprofessional service..the assigned partner does not turn up on time & the customer service is clueless!!! Pls stay away!!!
Booking cancelled, but no refund even after 25 days. There is no option to give rating below 1. Already raised query through App but till today no positive response from Urban Company Officials. Worst Customer care system.
Excellent job, very convenient easy to use, having very professional workers
Best service and the expert are Higenic nd on time..
From last 1 year I taken total 6 services. 3 are good, 1 average, 2 bad services. It all depends on service person. If you are lucky you will get good service person, if not then experience is bad. One suggestion for UC please keep language of service person and option to choose language. I don't know Hindi much, but some service person know only Hindi.
I have been a regular user of Urban Clap/Company service all over India. But I am shocked with the type of service provided in Guwahati. Professional doesn't get assigned, no response/call back. It has become utterly pathetic.
Revisiting the review , no option provided to contact customer care.. simple apps nowadays comes with virtual assistant atleast, so still not updated one
Quality and Professionalism Maintained.
Good
It's very satisfied for service
Urban ki staff preyanka chaturvedi ne meri ring waxing ke time uthari or mujhe di bhi nahi after waxing she left fir maine ring dekhi it's gone police complaint krungi mai aisa staff hai inka
excellent job üëè
Basic Services very expensive. Services not adequately detailed.
Pathetic is the word for the kind of service you offer. You guys rescheduled the appointment without asking me ?? Your professional called me and confirmed that she'll reach on time, minutes after that the appointment was cancelled and rescheduled without asking ?? So frustrating!
Very nice service
I had good experience all the 3 times, I have used their services
Pathetic services. Unprofessional partners. Very high charges
They may charge you a little extra than other apps but they will ensure that you get only the professionals . The app is easy to use and the services provided are the best!
Never take home painting/any services from Urban company.These are local painters only charging whopping amount. UC shows in it's fake ads that painters are trained by them but it's not true. There is no supervisor on the site.They damaged my tv and refrigerator and their sales person told me that they have insurance of 10000 against any damage caused by their labourer. But when I asked their cc executive they denied. Pathetic after sales service. Worst policy..they are not true to theirs words
Mohammed Abdul is an excellent technician. Very professional and polite
their staff damaged my washbasin pipe line. I have complained several times but no action has been taken so far. They said they would pay Rs.1,000 into the bank account. It didn't do that either. Don't believe them.
Great service
Very good painting service.
üö´ This app is a scam do not use it, I left my property not than 5 months ago and they are still taking money from my account. They use Dark UX practices that are banned by Google to lock you into a subscription that keeps talking money from your account... Do not use this app üö´üö´üö´
nice work very polite
The cleaners were professional. the service was satisfactory.
Salon at home is great
Urban company did not mention any thing about the fixed charges of 499 is for 4 rod or 6rod installation of ceiling cloth hanger in balcony. The professional has informed before starting the work that the service is only for 4 rod hanger and for installing 6 rod hanger he has asked for 300 more. We had to pay additional 300 for getting the job done. Urban company has to be more specific by clearly classifying the 4rod ceiling hanger installation and 6 rod ceiling hanger installation
Unprofessional behavior, bookings rescheduled without customer's confirmation and not available on time
Received a call the 7th time! Highlited SAME concenrs1)No option for adding/managing multiple addresses like in other apps & services (2)No customer service number to call post booking in case of any concerns with the booking or service (3) Told to read complaints as this was not an isolated issue. 7 calls, 7 times explained, but no resolution! ANYONE CONSIDERING UC, Please be informed.
Good
Home deep cleaning guys are unprofessional. Please stay away
Please do not use the app. Fraud
Professional works . Great job keep it up
First time taken service from UC and they are unable to generate invoice after completion service delivery to do payment online. Lots of discussion with their support and technical team but no any resolutions. I would like to pay online and their executive are forcing me to pay cash mode instead of online because unable to resolve invoice generate problem. Really pathetic....
I booked 2 days before but last moment they said they hv no one assigned.. not even refunding the amount i paid. Don't trust it..
without informing deducted 100rs from payment. Once again u guys proved that this is worst app we have ever come across,Yesterday 9-30 time booking was there.No one came...n u guys called n confirm that at 7-30 another guy will come.He also didn't come n he cancelled the booking.still app shows professional is on the way coming in 6 min.I tried to call 20 times no one even answered my call.Nw again in the afternoon u r calling n telling that we r unable to assign rs paid n no service sinc 2 days
Not the greatest , they call you 30 minutes before the home mades show up , and tell you we can't organise. Twice happened to us , and no compensation , Or free service for their own mistake .
Excellent service management. completely hassle free and tension free. Thanks for everything.
I am satisfied with Vipin Jaiswal's service for bed bugs control
Wrost experience......no value of time and money.....Will not recommend to any one.
very nice service, professional, good work
I was not happy with the service..I booked for Intense Bathroom Cleaning..the person came and said he did not have the machine or equipment to clean. Also I was asked to cancel the booking.. They share the videos showing machine cleaning and then deny sayiny that not all professionals have machine equipment.
Useless and pathetic service. I am trying to reach out to the service professional and the support team since 2 days and there has been no response. I paid in advance and even then, the service is absolutely horrible. Never using this platform again and will advise people to do so.
Reena is so professional and knows her job really well. She has magic in her hands. She cleared all the knots, I felt so relaxed and really enjoyed the session. She is really hardworking and well mannered lady. Would love to rebook her. Suggestion for Urban Company: Please try another alternative for bed which they have to carry. It is damn heavy and I was shocked to see how she was able to carry it alone after all they are also human. Please think about it humanity comes first.
Worst experience for TERMITE TREATMENT . All wastage of money. They fooled us as the treatment did not work at all and ‚Çπ5500 money in vain. All the time and money got wasted in the hassle to emptying all the spaces just to suffer more in that smell.
Not bad... Ok
very good service
Mr. Ajay G from urban company, he is nice in behavior,very humble, polite, and most adorable thing is he did excellent job.. thank you
Very Good
This is a life saver for someone new in town
Where can I file complaint on the very unprofessional work on bathroom cleaning
I have taken services from Mr. Subrata Sarkar but he damaged my bathroom and used Acid which spoiled my marble completely.
Worst app with even worse customer service !! Just can't contact them for anything !! Need clarity before booking n just not able to do so !! And if the repair service o book is not right the executive's visit n charges will have to be paid. And incase of any small issue or extra work the executive's ask huge amounts !! Hope they come up with customer service for booking atleast so that we can discuss n book it
Urban clap took full money in advance for house painting. Came first day did putty work, left it incomplete and left, next day did not turn up at all. They don't have any helpline to call you have to pray that some one contacts you. I am waiting for my issue to be addressed. I will not recommended Urban Clap based on my experience so far. It's 12.30pm till now Urban Clap has not fixed, no call backs except first one saying we are looking into it. The app has no way to escalate also.
Was able to get good service and the assigned person has done the work very clean and professional.
Worst haircut in my entire life.they send people with no knowledge..I m going to discontinue uc Also collect money in advance. Now I have a bad hairstyle, money wasted n a crying heart. I want to sue . I m disgusted These companies should be sued easily for bad work
Bathroom cleaning services found to be good.
Nice Team, Sincer Staff With great Product Value. Great Coordination of The Company Highly Appreciated.
I have very bad experience, I book for pest control on 27Oct, first spray was completed as scheduled but second job was booked for 10Nov but till now there is no response from UC or the executive. Also, requested for call back but no response. It is better to get pest control from outside.
Good Company for home appliances
It was very good service provided by them. They are well sanitized and highly professional. It's very convenience and affordable.
Overall a good one... Pricing is something UC need to work on.
Very good company . But Company is large rule. Rating sistem bad . But warrenty long time no good.
Unhappy with the unavailability in my hometown üôÅ
No customer service at all
I always prefer and recommended UC, but 49rs hygiene charge is not reasonable, there should be option for it that do they want to take those disposal gown etc. Lots of customers keep their personal gown at home so why would they pay for it? and using mask and gloves is their responsibility. parlour person also wear mask n gloves but they don't change us.
Very worst many Not good
They don't refund the full amt I paid fr 2 bathrooms and got refund for 1 .That is really bad
Worst experience with plumbing services.....no direct calling number available for Urban Company.....very very unprofessional and disappointing
extremely bad experience. They take pre payments and then cancel or reschedule bookings by themselves. This is the 3rd time. They dont have any helpline number or email so that no one can get back to them. I have lost my patience. I am considering complain in consumer forum.
Terrible experience..... Are not gives online payment options
Fraud company
Good service
Very bad Service üòî
useless and unprofessional company and inexperience partners and expensive service.
App is not functioning properly..its taking time to load..
Satisfied with UC services, Urban Company is safe and trusted. Services are perfect and affordable. Staff is very efficient and polite. In this Covid time, I can trust UC for hygiene and all safety measures.
Urban Company please launch body Spa for women too in Guwahati Assam. Also kindly do keep calm and expert body Spa trainers for the women clients so that no clash should happen to clients as well as to the beauticians/trainers. My humble request to please put a step forward for women body spa in Guwahati Assam. Body Spa is very essential for women skin as well as muscle to prevents from stress and skin breakouts. Your launch will be very appreciable. Thank you. Neha
Hi this is best services really wonderful job. Urban Company salon services take a good safety measures and staffs are too good like friendly
Good
The company takes the safety and hygiene of its customers and service professionals with utmost seriousness
Had bad experiences only I have requested twice for TV service and same bad experience. Urban company Techs are not professionals, I never rated for the services. But the techs asked for OTP saying it's for service and rated them themselves 5 star I recommend ppl to avoid Urban Company just because of their unprofessional techs
BEST 1
Professional called up a day before in the night and said he will come 2hours late
I requested a revisit. I raised a complaint and I got a call from a lady who informed me that she will send another tech but no one came ,raised another complaint and got Ayush who was rude very bad customer service.

App takes lot of time to load

Pathetic service
Very bad attitude and does not respect time
Very üëé üëÉ company
Vary bat company
you are rate is increasing but not updated to customer
Pathetic service I want my money back you basterds
Sooper cool and polite
Worst bathroom cleaning and kitchen cleaning service ever. I had incoured huge loss because of multiple issues. Worst customer service support team. They misguide you to book service saying money will be refunded and then say we Never said That. Local vendors provide much better service. This is certainly not a no 1 app nor it's going to be. My complaints are open till today from Sep 05 2021.
much needed service for busy Bangaloreans...very professional!!
Very good
Fantastic job
Excellent service.

great experience
it was my first salon experience through UC..The Proffesional, So a Dhulia.. did a grtt job..following full protocol...The massage given by her was Astounding.. would be delighted to be served by her again
she is very nice and polite I liked her service
Very bad experience for carpet cleaning. Got the confirmed booking slot for 3rd Nov but got call that professional couldn't be assigned & it kept on going till 11th Nov & then finally professional is assigned but then he called & told he couldn't come. Then got a notification of service cancelation. They charged for UC plus membership at the time of booking at a discounted price & while canceling they'll refund taking the full charge for UC plus membership. Very Awful experience. Least suggested
Good
It's the second time my services are cancelled
Not taking care of customers looking after their agents
The app design has several flaws. Bookings do not get confirmed when online payment fails at app end instead of confirming the booking and converting it to cash on service like other apps such as big basket. One has to rebook which is tedious and not just friendly for to the Package listing and layout. This is on top of waiting for over 2 days to receive refund for payment deducted. Options for customer resolution are limited and not user friendly.
Assigned a professional with only one dose of vaccination. Attempts cant be made to request change. Phone helpline keeps telling you to hold on, even after five minutes. My earlier experiences with the co. were much better. Service slipping down?
Crossed my expectations
Pathetic service
Worst service ever. I have used it once and that was last.
I booked washing machine(fully automatic top load) services from urban company. The mechanic said need to replace the gear box of the machine. He replaced gearbox, capacitor & belt in 8 days. The total cost he made Rs6500/‚Äî. However on enquiry the total cost found Rs3500/‚Äî. The guy did not provide any price tag.Now the problem is urban company does not take responsibility to intermediate. Let the customer & service provider to fight.Betr to Call machine service provider rather than third party.
The performance of the Urban company (UC) is worst on Painting of walls. I had booked for wall painting on 14th October 2021. The UC employee Mr Shiv Shankar Pandey told me that work will be completed within 3 days but till date no work is completed. UC company get full payment before the project start, it is its business tricks and customers suffer. Mr Pandey got excellent reviews from his own tricks by asking OTP at very booking and before the work started he enjoys with reviews in his favour.
very bad
Application does not work. Gets stuck loading during the booking process for home cleaning. Not great experience
Nice app
Booking canceled without my knowledge
good service
The person did not clean anything
Profesional untrained....
UC's AC servicing is far more detailed than routine AMC contracts. Very Satisfactory
There is no way to speak to customer care. No option what so ever to reach. Signed up for their membership, booked for a service, service got cancelled 12hrs before after waiting two days, got a slot for three days later, all this for a tv mount installation. Upon getting a call from customer care hevput me on hold for more than 10 mins until I cut the call. Asked him to just cancel my booking along with my subscription. He very slyly cancelled my booking only. Now now way to reach out to them
wow. didn't expect the results. Thorough professional work
Worst!! Don't recommend, the professional damaged my property. And only 50% amount refunded, I am going to complaint to the consumer care. With all proofs
good
Rrr
Booked Hair Cut via the app, highly professional work done by them
Recommendable
The paid package got auto cancelled. No refund since a month after 7-8 follow ups. Don't expect this kind of service !
Worst service .don't use
Job well done.
Pathetic service ...they canceled 2hrs prior..that too for a hair styling service..leaving customer in mess
Good experience if demanded..
Excellent serviceüëç
Terrible app, no way to contact professional it's just keep asking to call back from registered number even when you call from registered number
Pathetic company. Pathetic people. Pathetic support.
No customer care is available
MOHD IRFAN HELP OUT AND CLEAN BLOCKAGE IN PIPELINE OF DRAINAGE IN MY WASHROOM
I am not satisfied with this app because I am by profession beautician + make-up artist and es app me sirf ek option select kar sakte vo bhi only for beautician this is not okay if someone able to do multiple things in work there is option not available , I want to suggest urban clap change or catagory selection
overpriced
Very bekar company
One should look for alternatives before using this app. They cancel or reschedule your booking as per their convenience while denying the refund, the lacky customer care also never calls back or provided a solution. It should be named urban money instead of company since money is all they think about.
very useful
One of the worst app in terms of customer support. You don't get an option to get customer care support easily. A lot of reschedules are expected for a proper service to be done. Description of many services are not clear and you will end up losing your money or arguing with the professional.
They do not control over the people they sent for work, very rude and unskilled people come for work also. It's depends on your luck who turns up for work.
Worst experience ever. The professional calls me few hours before the schedule and says he can't come so I need to reschedule so that some other professional can accept the service. But there was no professional available for next few days and I even contacted customer care for help. They simply said to cancel the service at last moment as there was no availability for few days. This is not acceptable as I had made the payment 3 days in advance.
Excellent Service
Useless
I have booked for water filter repair in the month of March 2021, they repaired by replacing motor and filters. I have paid Rs 4670. Since then it got repairs for three times and I engaged person from outside. Today also it stopped working and service people from aquaguard told that motor fitted is duplicate and it should be replaced with the new one. Please tell me I am facing mental agony towards your service. Please rectify your mistake and do needful. Please call me
Worst worst service the professional come very late according to appointment the day I booked he say I can't come today mam I said it's ok next day he is also late very poor
Super job
best service
Good Service
Service partner was late. He didn't have suitable tools. Urban company custemer care kept bushing for another booking. Complete waste of money and time.
Services are costly and visiting charge is also high. it should be around 70
If I am booking for kids so it is showing men booking
Superb... Reasonable price and best part is warrent cover for repairs done
Best service by Urban Company
Worst app the kind of services they have mentioned is completely different from what you will actually get. Uninstalling you big time!!!
I've got 2 screenshots i'm posting in twitter. 1st says fair usage policy max discount on membership is 8 times membership amount (thats 2400 for a 299 membership). And the 2nd screenshot shows 12 membership expired in 9 months because total discount limit reached (at 1200) which is HALF the amount they advertised/promised while selling the membership.
It was a very bad experience with urban company, As the clean process was not at all acceptable. The technician denied to clean the area. The fittings were also not proper. Won't be recommending for any type of work.
Not satisfied with the service .The person didn't have any professional attitude and he was incapable in his skills to do the task. As mentioned while Booking of my chimney cleaning by the company I didn't receive the service too poor
They can change the date of your schedule booking without your consent.
Best service
Good
excellent
Good
Really good company and professional employees
Booked a plumber who made things worse.. Short my mains and it is not working since. seems this is how they do business, by creating a problem for which you may have to make another booking
Nice service
Good Professional Worker
I have been using Urban Company for over 3 years now, have availed almost all of its services, very easy to use and you can assign the professional you want for the visit, they have the best customer service available with no question asked.
Poor service
very bad experience and thay don't have sufficient staff
Very cheap copmny
Service has no complaits
Too expensive even for minor repairs
Members having UC Plus get a discount but there is no technician available for that members. If booked from a different person phone (without UC Plus subscription) technician becomes available for the same location. It is complete cheating from UC. After several calls and more than a month nothing has changed so far. UC customer support is now speaking as if they don't know about the issue.
1st time Experienced with Urban Clap. Extremely happy and satisfied. Hope I'll get same satisfied job next time also. Thank you so much!! üôè
My first experience with UC during AC services are excellent
Horrible experience with urbanclap. I had booked for geyser repair through Urbancompany. The technician, whose rating was surprisingly 4.6*, came and took a look at the geyser. He mentioned that it requires some repair and that he would take it(with 2j advance amount) with him and return the next day. . The next day, no show from the technician. His phone number is switched off. This happened 10 days back. Urban company also doesn't seem to care clearly. This issue will be taken to consumercourt
Bathroom cleaning bookings are pathetic, even after festive seasons, professionals don't accept the bookings on time and again and again ask to reschedule the appointments
Too many additional useless charges. They are adding Rs49 for every booking as covid precautions. Which is a Rs 5 mask üò™
unnecessarily expensive, inspite of paying job fee which is higher than a normal rate from someone outside there is a 40rs fee extra for the worker to wear a mask and gloves and use sanitizer, on top of this an extra additional 60 rs for visitation fees, what a big rip off! not using this app anymore.
I wish I could give a negative rating for this company. Horrible customer relationship management. They're not updated with their technology and always creating confusion between customers and their assigned professionals. Constantly cancelling services despite commitment. and again for the third time in a row they call mr up saying that the professional is stuck with the previous appointment so cant turn up right noe. they are not trust worthy at all and highly inefficient.
Anju was superb, would prefer her again
simply good
Good
Third class service Not responding after pay ment done
nice app
Worst .. the cleaners dint show up nd this company doesn't have a phone number to contact ... Disappointed...
No customer care...no help.... unnecessary taking cancellation charges
Pls improve your app
There is no way to reach customer support, no phone number/ email or chat support available. Pathetic. I paid upfront amount for a package and now there is no way I can make a subsequent booking...so frustrating.
Bad very poor
my worst experience.i booked professional for kitchen cleaning yesterday.the assigned professional didn't show up nd customer care promised to send another professional 2 hrs later.i was still ok with that.bt even after 4 hours, apparently they couldn't find anyone nd kept saying sorry(sorry ka achaar daalun!!).i was so upset as i had emptied my kitchen already nd had to do all the cleaning and reorganizing by myself till late night.this clearly shows that customers' time is not their priority.
Veey few professionals available in Bhopal. Constant cancellations and reschedules.
very good

Better than expected
Excellent! The service(haircut) that the Urban Company provided me at home is what I can't get even at a renowned salon; at such competitive price. And many more facilities are available.
Too expensive. No customer support mail address.
Keep using service companies but this one is worst from the first second. Phone number says not available in Ksa.. whatsapp not works.. there is no email.. so who cares the customer? You charged money but shows failed in app.. refund immediately or we will complain to the all official ways..
Doesn't deserve even a single ‚≠ê
Worst app in the world they don't appoint a single person for our service
Fraud. They don't refund after fake promises. Don't respond to mails
Worst experience ever. Will never ever book any service from urban clap. Third class service. Hight payment charges. No one from the customer service able to solve our problem.
Good. Please maintain the quality and reward dedicated and good employees throught incentives.
fantastic technician good work he did...we are very satisfied.
PATHETIC EXCUSES, RUDE PEOPLE, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE YOU SEND FOR NON-PRIME CUSTOMER IF PRIME CUSTOMER RECEIVED THIS.
Worst app.. No customer care service, no professional people and too cost o. Simple works
After repeated attempts no call back for my assured TV repair disgusting service don't buy there insurance plan I have wasted my money. way too unprofessional then expected
Generally good
We have opted RO filter from urban clap. The person named sridhar gupta had done fraud with us. He gave assurance of 1 yr for RO filter but it dint work properly for 3 months. Now when we have called for repair he is not responding and dome fraud with us saying I'll arrange. We have spent around 2500+rs for RO filter....
really very nice work done by bala Murugan very professional and did his work very relaxed and professional way...thank you
Changing 5star rating to 2star, as I am unable to go to "manage address" section. App is hanging and without the right address this app and all its services are useless. Might even drop my rating to 1star, if the developer team can't even give a bug free experience.
THEY ARE CHEATERS... THEY PROMISE SERVICE... TAKE MONEY... THEN DONT GIVE SERVICE....
schedule and reschedule and cancel...This is the experience from last 2 weeks..
less quantity of product.
A very good app to connect with professionals for household services
The cost while booking shows 350 for Water Leakage in Split AC. But after the repair, the consultant shows the rate card with 649 as the cost. This is quite misleading.
Not able to book Quick Setvice for Split AC in Chennai. Not getting the calendar to pick the date and time. Not sure whether it is a bug or app issue or any other technical issues.
good and reliable application
Very bad. I ordered a sofa cleaning service. My sofa got teared off.
Recently i am not happy with professional urban company is sending, I think urban company should focus more on professional taking proper info and understanding issue before expecting booking
Proper service and charging correctly
Good service recommand to use it
Updating my review as Urban Clap did respond back promptly to my queries. My queries were about additional charges and Warranty claim if task not completed properly. So UC did provide support by fulfilling the warranty. About the charges, I still believe they need to improve the app. So before the work starts we need to provide an OTP. At this point the technician should provide an estimate and this should be recorded in the app. So that the technician can't arm twist customer once after start
Do work Sunflam Prestige
I was happy with the service. I suggest adding more services like Core Cutting, etc.
Good experience
In last 3 years of me being a customer,today was my worst experience more than the partner it was the escalation team member who called me for the resolution instead he drove me completely mad after not knowing both sides of the coin.The employee's name was *Rahul* who called the partner before he called me to understand the situation better but instead he gathered all the wrong answers & he started with his justification before he could ask me my problem atleast !! Pathetic escalation call
Always late only.
Worst experience, arrived late for the scheduled cleaning and denied the service. Unprofessional service partner and rude UC executives. Overall sooo negative. They charge 499 if we have to rescheduled and don't bother if the service person denies the schedule beyond the prescribed time. The executive calls at 9 pm in night and ask to cancel or reschedule. We can't give feedback on service partner as he has not delivered the service. Very unprofessional company.
The bathroom cleaning was done using acids,our tiles,handles etc have got blotches.no after sales service,no compensation.advice to go for other home cleaners.
Urban Company: The worst service company ever The technician arrived half an hour late in the first place and he didn‚Äôt seem professional as claimed by urban clap. The so called professional cleaning company turned out to be a bunch of amateurs who ended up damaging my costly sofa. Despite lodging repeated complaints all I got was sweet talking executives who kept on assuring me that the case manager is working on the case and no one got back to me with any resolution. Its been 9 days so far.
The entire story on work insurance is a sham. There is no customer empathy and the agents sent by urban company are incompetent or frauds for which they never take responsibility. Please beware and use services on your own risk.
Excellent app. Very professional person on Urban Company.
Disgusting service. Professional has cancled the booking and i have not get refund.
Your service provider not visit on time so disgusting
Professional is not assigned even after 2 days
Pathetic services. These guys take the bookings and advance payment and the professional doesn't turn up. I rescheduled the first time it happened yesterday but then canceled the booking when this happened again the next day. The representative who calls to inform that the service can't be delivered, also needs to be a taught a thing or two. How can they be all chirpy and smiling when the customer is complaining? Highly dissapointed
Booking probalam without inform me my booking cancel
there should be option for users to block the professionals whom they don't want to be re assigned
Irresponsible help desk. No response to mails also. Not even refunded my money.
We booked UC service for 2 toilets, 5 fans and 1 balcony. UCs, so called "Professionals‚Äú after cleaning 1 toilet asked as to cancel other toilet booking siting too much scaling work to do. We sowed him Rs.500/ and suddenly he was ready to do the other toilet. After he finished other toilet, we kicked him out without taking the fan and balcony service. This is not the first time UCs "professionals" demand more money siting one or another excuse. Try their service than you believe my words.
Pathetic service,maids not at all professional.i have to clean my house immediately after they went off .I booked service for 2n half hr for 2 maids they went half an hr before and the service they gave was worst than ever they didn't clean washrooms n kitchen properly.By their cleaning not even simple stains on floor went off.Even aftr repeated telling they didn't cleaned washroom cabinets,kitchen cabinets n oven etc.waste of money.waste of time .waste service they gave worst worst worst
First I booked service for AC cleaning which was horrible and service person argued rudely with my family members , inspite of that bad experience I booked second service for bathroom cleaning which was again very bad, bathroom was not cleaned properly when we asked them they gave lame reasons stating that stains are very had to remove . When I log a complaint no one is calling me back , without any resolution they are closing it. I don't know what kind of customer service they do
Bakwas app
Nice app
very customer friendly
Not able to book pest control services
Very good service
Professional services
poor customer service
Gud service provided by UC
great üëå effort.really talented and have taken initiative for styling and cutting.
Attitude and the quality of cleaning was excellent
I had booked in urbanclap one day before and as per the norms,the professional was supposed to be assigned one hour before they visit your home., but nothing was assigned it kept on delaying and I had to reschedule it,the same thing happened again. It was my first and last experience with urban clap.
Excellent job done.
Don't fall for Signature massage /packages. Go for standard massage as they are all the same.
fantastic experience
The visiting person demanded more than rate card saying urban company is using duplicate cheap spare parts, I used original. I raised complaint and call center defended visiting person. Pathetic.
nice work
Recieved a nice today... The person was nice.. But has many arguments and recieved delayed services... The person did not come in appropriate time.
Excellent service.
I have booked a carpenter service at 4'0 clock for Noida and paid in advance..On 7.10 P.m customer care called and saying sorry for inconvenience that we are not able to find any carpenter..Today is my spouse Birthday and we have been waiting 3 hours for carpenter and postponed our schedule.. So i do not recommended Urban company services..They ditched you any time by saying sorry for inconvenience
This online service is really good opurtunity for customers and urban company employees... With genuine experts in their own field along with the tracking.... Especially in this COVID situation sitting at home itself getting best service... Thank you...
Good
Don't ever order cleaning services from this app! There is no customer support. You have to first book a service and then only you will get to know about anything. Other services are good, but trust me you can clean way better than these people. Or else you can just ask your maid or someone to do that, paying much less money and getting far better service.
A nice app though i would have given (5stars) but some service partners are very rude i will give the service partner a (7/10)
Most worst app .. I have opted a service and paid money in advance... UC neither provided service nor refunded money .. I have struggled for almost 7 months to get my money back but still they didn't refund full amount... DO NOT RECOMMEND... poor customer service... UC denied that advance paid amount , later they refunded partial and it's going on....
All appointments are not honoured. They will cancel it at the last moment. Also they wont refund you membership amount. Very bad experience. Customer care is even worst. They have no clue.
Very bad sarvice do this application ... west of time ...
Professional and good value
Absolutely pathetic service here in Chennai. Opted for UC plus membership. Still a lot of issues with your services. Most of the times your representatives deny to provide services. Won't suggest anyone to use your facilities.
good
all compulsory cleaning facilities available
This is the worst service ever, intiallly they were good. After that the cleaner dont even come. can't explain how frustrating it is
Pathetic response No customer care number in the app
Smooth App, Easy Navigation. Quick and easy interface. Right information about services and vendors.
Waste of time!
Very bad experience..... I have booked for paint since sept. And paid too but till now house get not painted...
Perfect in all spheres.
Pampi chakraborty ( howrah) horrible unprofessional attitude she did not come at scheduled time and because was her my work schedule had to suffer, horrible professional at urban company they don't understand the value of others time
really great services at door steps according to your sutability.
Worst experience ever with the app and the professional. Would never book or recommend to book any services from UC. No commitment, they reschedule as they wish without informing prior. There is no way to reach out to any call center or chat support. Issues are not listed properly under help button to register any complaint or call and talk to an appropriate person.
The payment is collected and the beautician doesn't answer her phone. Her husband says I don't where she is. Urban company isn't calling back either. Fraud!
Horrible services
Absolutely pathetic approach by tue so called "professional". Made an appointment for installing a lot washing machine, first day his vehicle broke down, next day he requested to reschedule the appointment and third day, the gentleman kept us waiting for 3 hours by confirming that he would be their at our place in next 40 mins (which clearly never happened) and then eventually stopped picking the phone. If this is what the professionalism is, God save this company.
I am having a very bad experience from urban company for last 2-3 times . They are cancelling the bookings on their own without prior intimation to the customer.. After assigning the beauticia, these guys are rescheduling the services at their own convenient time, Without confirming rescheduled time with the customers. Sheer unprofessional and irresponsible attitude.
Cheating and not fair
Terrible experience,booked for skin care, no so called'proffessionals' turned up, they themselves rescheduled the time slot, giving odd excuses by calling three four times a day.No assignment of "professional' in time.No value of customer's time. Pathetic experience
Excellent Work Hygienic Punctual Polite And Friendly
Services is not good üò°
A service I always wished for.... New Urban app for a urban india....
I rated one star as Zero rating is not available
Suddenly the app begin to display no professional available for the last few weeks. Irritating experience !
Very bad experience never suggest to any one to book with urban clap.they will take the booking and at the last moment their representatives cancel the booking because they can not clean my sofa as it will take extra time to clean, and he was just trying to spray some water mixed with just ordinary detergent to clean it but their is different chemicals to clean the sofa but they are trying to save their cost and time. I am also trying to complaint in consumer court.
Horrible service
Pathetic service and no care for one's time
Superb Experience.
Nice
good service
good
The painting services is pathetic and I would suggest not to use this service. The professionals don't turn up and they will waste the entire day. I have booked this services twice and had similar experience.
good
Excellent üëå
Asked money for cancellation of my booking. Quoting Rs. 2000 for a internal wiring of aprox 4 meter. Very unprofessional behaviour.
This company deserve 0 star ..they waste time, irresponsible and totally d grade.dont take service from them.i never suggest go for this company..customer care service is very poor...they close complaint without solution and without ur knowledge .
very nice
Unsatisfactory quality of painting and waterproofing. Very poor customer service. Even after requesting site visit 3-4 times, no person has visited the site. Customer care not calling back and saying "We couldn't reach you". Not recommended to go for painting or any other work.
exceptional service and comparable prices. UC is becoming first choice for household works. keep it up. thanks.
There is blank screen appwaring when tap on manage address in help centre This app has an basic issue
Profefnal and well behaved.
Not satisfactory service Unprofessional Team unessary increase your bill. 3rd class customer care service
I booked pack of 2 by mistake. I got only one single hair cut . The guy took 300/- Cash for colour , saying that he gave his own colour ! I think I have overpaid ( Rs.597 +300 cash ) for one hair cut n colour. Hair cut ( pack of 2 means what? Two hair cuts ? ?) Pl refund the amount of one hair cut which I have paid extra or give me credit for the next hair cut !
The service levels have decreased considerably over the years from decent to pathetic.I had real bad experience with ac servicing and electrical issue. It is understandable that technician can make a mistake but uc doesn't help to fix the issue moreover there is no way to contact them. It's totally their wish and will when they will call or even call to fix the issue they created in the first place.
Excellent service
good
It's bogus. No service. No accountability. They are faking it. Customer is not important for them.
Very good services and excellent.
paid to Manikandan through online transfer
Good service
Not repair things, only take high visiting charges.
Hopeless cleaning services and left without completing and now company too not refunding my money... Big time cheaters..
The professionals don't turn up even after making the payments in advance. The customer care will call you back only if they feel like. They will reschedule your booking, only for the professional to not turn up, yet again. And this just goes on in a loop. Do not recommend at all!
I had requested for a parlour service on Nov 5 and scheduled a service for Nov 7. The lady called me one hour before the scheduled time today and asked for rescheduling. The allocation of the technician was done yest evening. This last minute upsetting of planned schedule of a client is unprofessional. I asked her to cancel the booking. She went ahead with rescheduling the service at her convenience. The app does not have an option to raise a complaint against such arbitrary behaviour.
Today, I am very disappointed. I booked by paying so much and you guys assigned person with 4,66. When my preferred beautician wasnt available, you guys should have called me to confirm instead assigning a person with less rating
It has become so easy for us to take services while sitting at home and that too when we don't have time to go out... Happy with Urban Clap services
Nice
Service center keeps on rescheduling your appointment.. they are not bothered about this bad service and keeps on saying they can't help.. wasted my 3 days even after making fu advance payment.. very poor service..
Excellent
I wanted to book massage for me and my husband same pain relief if priced higher for women, what is the rationale.
I wrote a review and you didnt accept it because it was not in your favor. I will definitely stick to my words. Fault is at your end. This app is useless. Have guts to accept any kind of review. You have cancelled my services back to back and even I have zero tolerance for such an act. To all the users, urban clap is not customer friendly. It loots our money and cancels services. If you have guts publish my review. I will keep writing same review again until you improve your service.
Really very useful app. Quality service @ best rates.,üëåüëåüëå
Jyoti did my service good
Guys please don't do your bookings here. The professionals and the company itself does not provide what exactly is paid for. They just took the money for nothing. WORST ever. Please go to other companies. Cheaters and huge waste of time. 0 stars
After 1st bad experience.... The rescheduled order is really very impressive.. the professional done his work very well. Thanks UC.
Every time the experience gets better and better. Urban company is a boon indeed!!
Bathroom cleaning good. But ceiling not properly cleaned. And rooms after cleaning seen dirty
The most unprofessional company in today's day and age. I booked a massage and the booking was accepted and paid for. 15 minutes before the alloted time, I had no update from them. When I reached out, they tell me they have no professionals available after accepting the booking and taking the money for it. How can you not deliver once you have confirmed and done a transaction??? They ruined my whole day and plan. Horrible. Please don't book anything from them
Very professional
Good job done by Mala
No way you can talk to customer care. Help centre is only for useless, worthless FAQs
Very useful
I have already pay yearly subscription and services fee but engineer not come timely. Engineer not pick my phone
Very good services for a good price
Nice and prompt service. Very useful for hassle free things.
Dear Concern, I am facing below issues on your application: 1) Not able to find your customer care number. If someone is in need of help, how to get in touch with you guys? 2) Not able to book painting slots. No slots are available for painting service from last 3 days. UPDATE: Received a call ...I request you to check call recording & see your customer service standards. It's Pathetic.. Regards A Paid Membership Owner
Excellent service provided by professional...
very good service...i loved
Time to stop using this app. None of the cleaning services are upto the mark. U spend 1200 and when u report a poor service they give 400 uc credits so that u can waste more money and get no results. Lets go for local guys. Much better. Gross service. The professional for disinfection was untrained and was unaware of how it was to be done. He spoiled my walls. He sprayed it on my papers spoiling the prescription. Nothing was wiped. Water and dirt all around after he left. Spots on glasses
Worst service provider, the professionals are ill mannered. Pathetic service
very nice app
I'm very happy with service.nice experience
Fast and effective services
Too many extra charges.. Waste services
Why are we being charged 40 rs extra everytime for safety gear when the UC members never come in safety gear anymore
Grear service
It was awesome! Please help us get Urban Company at Davangere too... I am happy to take up the franchise as well üòä
Very unprofessional app!I booked an appointment for haircut. But the assigned pro could not maintain the time. And when I told her that, she showed me the attitude!
Professional are good but cost is like a loot.. literally ripping people off in the name of additional charges.. no issues with the service cost but UC adds so many different charges on top of that.. which is absolutely ridiculous.. urge UC to maintain ethical practices
Professional doesn't turn up even when paid in advance and customer support service don't have any solution.
Fraud company
Too expensive. Your executive is charging more than 3/4th the cost of the product itself, just for drilling few holes and installing/wall-mounting the product. I surely can't pay 800 bucks for installation when product itself is for 1000 bucks.
Very unprofessional...booked an appointment for yesterday which was resheduled today for 10 am and still the professional has not arrived...neither answering the call would recommend not to opt for this service.
Excellent üî•‚ù§Ô∏è
Very disappointed with urban clap. . Terrible service provided and horrible customer service..... professional don't come on time and urban clap dnt take responsibility for the same.....will suggest pl dnt book through urban compnay
Wow! What a Service.... its just Awesome! Thanks a ton UC
Bipin and gang did an excellent jib
good
very good ‚ò∫Ô∏è
No slots is available for 1 month I am seeing this.
UC consultant naver call nor come on given time.
I had booked for cleaning the bathroom but due to rain professional assigned to the work denied to do the cleaning. I raised the complaint on 03.11.2021 but so far there is no response from Urban Company. How pathetic service, now a days UC is giving. There is no call customer service. So sad. I have paid the amount and I am unable to take it refund. I have not registered any mail id
Worst Workers in your company , all of them , all are saying to cancel the booking , so that they can take cash from us . All are fraud . Call me to know those frauds .
Seriously.. They don't bother to respond. Naam bade aur Darshan chhote. Had booked their service earlier on 2nd Nov that time I can understand during Diwali it can happen but again reschedule it on 6th Nov but useless. No professional assigned yet. Their call center service also not good. I cancelled their service because I got bad experience. But I would recommend never use their service and never buy memebership. cancellation charges also they charge. Pathetic service.
Booked for Indore(M.P)-home cleaning, for 4th but they cancelled and rescheduled for 6th nov .Now when I got up to follow up , saw it's automatically changed to 7th nov.. they don't value your time
Most 3rd class services all the categories.
Good service
Arrangeed non standard spares and charging high
Very poor service. Fraudulent. Zero customer service. They have terms n conditions like no other. Please stay away from this con artists. Better be safe than sorry.
Very good service
Very very worrest app
Terrible App. Poor service. Worst customer care (that is if they have one - there is no way to contact them, you have to wait for them to call and they never do). I got cheated in house painting. They gave faulty paint and there are spots on walls now. Was struggling to get in touch with customer care as despite using their helpline nobody called for 15 days. And their representative was rude. No clear guidelines in services, their professionals decide what is included. PATHETIC!
The professionals are not available in case of classic booking and if you're going for prime ,the professionals are readily available what kind of service is this
payment methods could be improved. it is difficult to navigate currently. thanks
Pathetic service. Booked saloon service in the morning 7AM, waited till 10am just to get a call from them saying we are unable to arrange a beautician. Never going to book again
What does company mean by visitation charges?? So if I book a carpenter/plumber for the work I shud pay him visit charges too? Really?? Have started looting clients. Earlier when I had purchased membership they were givin discount if 100rs on every service now they have made that 50rs. Plus added visitation fees.
Pathetic experience. The company is thief. Never take services for electrical appliances. Had extremly bad experience. The company can only apologise and are dependent on their tie up for services. it's better to contact local service providers,atlest they have a store to enquire. Guys don't get fooled by this company .
Service is good but not has expection, should give proper description of the job in Service, Or else The worker just fool us later. Did toilet bathroom cleaning he just cleaned the toilet didn't even clean the floors or sink of bathroom.
good service
Today I felt cheated for the first time.I paid for a salon service in advance with a hope that it will be delivered, but the technician did not turn up stating she was unable to connect to me, though the appointment was confirmed in the morning itself. Never expected deficiency in service from UC. No grievance redressal system.no way to recover money for service paid but not rendered.. this is really very very bad.
Cleanliness is not per expectations
Pathetic. I have booked cleaner with them.. application assigned cleaner who was on leave but they did not bothered to change cleaner or inform me. when i called customer care after wasting my 1.5 hours then they apologise. Very irresponsible. I am not going to use this application ever.
excellent service
Why is that all the technicians suggest to change and purchase new product immediately. Especially they have tie up and immediately they pressurize saying to buy immediately and insist the same. Top of it today the technician has broken the valve and insist to buy geyser from his known friend. Pathetic people
Easy to book a required home service
Abdul Hameed as good service and thanks you ubran company and Hameed now no cockroaches in home
Very Poor Service...Useless. I had asker for plumber for repair for WC Leakage. He has done nothing but wasting time and money. ....Third Class Urban Company Service.
At home getting every facilities
good
I had previously used service for Beautician and everything was good. I upgraded and took one year subscription. Later that since past 1 week I'm trying to book a plumber and totally disappointed. Nobody really cares. My booking has been cancelled and rescheduled more than twice. Pathetic.
Pathetic explanation in nail section.they expect to customer know it all.
Very terrible service
Awesome
Horrible experience!! Kept waiting for my cleaner for 2 hours. None of the agents help..such a waste of time. Highly disappointed.
Horrible experience. Would have given zero stars ifit allowed me. Multiple bookings with no show up. All the numbers provided they don't pick up. When I finally managed to speak to some supervisorhe reobooked but again no show up. I am still waitijg for the company to get back to me with a clarification. Strongly suggest not to use this.
Loving the cleaning and massage service. It's very convenient to get all these services at home!
Great app for all appliances and electrical machines repair
Through professional work.... Excellent !!
The facility may be good but app is pathetic. No option for customer support. No option for chat. I purchased membership for 12 months, which they expired in four months. This is not fair. No option to contact these people
The worst experience ever, the maid is 1 hr late and I can't even reach her. No reply, no customer service and if reschedule 25 will be deducted. What I have other appointments.....how 1 hr delay us acceptable. I would never use this app again
Very frustrating service. The booking for bathroom cleaning was cancelled at last moment.
Nice app
fast service
Very unprofessional company assigning and canceling bookings without informing the client.
Had a very bad experience 6 months ago. Never availed service again
There is no option to reach out to customer service, in case we have any query.
Worst company for services. Repeatedly, my booked services have either arrived very late or gets cancelled in the last minute. Cards are stored on the app and gets automatically renewed for membership. There is no way to revert this charge!!
Pathetic company. I have made several complaints againt their partner but they haven't taken any action against him. Pls stop using this company as their services became pathetic.
I had booked for full home cleaning but cancelled by urban company. It should be some rules and penalty if urban company cancelled booking itself. Urban company cancelled My booking many time. Very worst experience.
Bad services, service staff, their assimilation is slow not knowledgeable to respond like they are sleeping... Female staff are late not respecting time . lying about the late its friday morning and saying there is traffic... we have not to trust the advertising
Was charged for PPE Kit but the technician was without the kit. You must refund kit charges
The Best.
Took down my comment. But still don't have enough trust in UC
pathetic usability ., how to contact you in the first place dont give ridiculous answers like we are reachable at helpcenter , no there is no option to contact you there.
Very poor service, unprofessional behavior with customer. Professional is shameless & very liar. Sirf jhuth hi bolte hai company wale aur unke so called professional. Customer ki koi value nahi karte hai. Sirf payment se hi matlab hai, meri sab se request hai ki kabhi bhi advance payment na kare. Payment milte hi humari koi help nahi karte. Jitna possible ho utna local mechanic se kam karvaye. Urban Company useless hai. Ye 4 star diye hai wo kitna gatiya kam karte hai unke hai so boycott UC
Bad company
Very bad experience. I booked chimney cleaning service and after waiting for 4 days urban clap cancelled my booking saying no service engineer is available asked me to book again. I booked again but same response. Again after 3 days cancelled.
I have been doing Detan at salons and this is the first time I tried Detan service provided by Urban Company at home. The Crave Beauty Detan is the most pathetic product that your company has made. The scrub and the mask felt like as if a Tiger balm was applied on my face and my face started to burn. I couldn't even keep the products applied on my face for a minute also. It not only made me feel like my skin is burning but also made me feel uncomfortable with it's strong unbearable smell.
This is 2nd time I got the worst experience. Appointment today at 8.00am but person is not yet reach neither attending phone nor call back. Least bothered. No value for customer time . Very dispointing behavior from company. Can't recommend to anyone .
Good
Fine. Saloonnservice is best that I still used form urban company.
Wecalled so many times but machine is saying pl use app but we cannot see any complain box.orwe don't know how to connect with you if we have complain
I am very disappointed with the service, I had booked the bathroom cleaning and the person denied cleaning and lied that the chemical cannot clean the bathroom due to some issue. The helpline was so bad that they didn't even give me a next day as alternative day
I waited for the professional on the scheduled time but she didn't show up. The company's contact number was always busy or not answering. The professional replied after 100000 missed calls informing me that the driver didn't pick her up and she is not coming today. The company called me later asking if the driver arrived and dropped the professional. And in the middle of the call she informed me that the driver made as accident at 8A.M. How can I trust a company such a company again.
Trust me, this is legit one of the best apps ever.. They have amazing and polite service.. I live this
not that great
It has become very costlier .
There is some serious issue with the app. It shows an address which I don't want to use in the booking and doesn't check which address I need the service at. Furthermore the Manage addresses page draws up a blank and throws up an error, - Something went wrong. I cancelled the booking as it dint work. Also earlier I could book the service and pay on successful completion of the service. Now it asks to pay even before assigning the person.Hope UC is not losing customers due to this.Please check.
Pathetic Service. Please don't pay before hand. Always choose cod. After paying online, company may not send cleaning professional. Useless and poor service.
I booked a beautician who did not respond to my phone calls and wasted my time on a festival day. Later, she calls me after 2 hours casually asking me if i still need to service, like waoh! When I asked her why would she waste my time, all she had to do was cancel my booking or just give me a call or atleast pick mine, to which she deliberately cut my phone call. I am amazed by the people you hire Urban Company and that you have no provision to keep in check of who your professionals.
good service
Great experience
Worst experience with urbanclap. They are rescheduling service without informing customer. What is help line contact?
Excellent
The professionals don't turn up even after paying in advance. What's appalling is that they don't even bother to inform the customers. And their call center support is not for supporting you but to tell you how wrong you are to even ask for support on any booking.Talking to them is like breaking your head on the wall.
No customer service worst app. Do not book it or use it they take bookings and then cancel at last minute. Upon calling no number is mentioned useless people.
The professionals sent by Urban company are poorly trained and will end up causing permanent damage to your property. Better avoid it.
Too much costly.Go for local people nearby for your repairs unless you don't know anyone. Does not have customer care toll free number. All automatic. Doesn't assign proper technician. For example for RO service they charge 650rupees. Seriously? Even branded kent charges 350rs including change of outer filter. Also UC they don't give choice to select brand and send person who knows to work on that brand. Just waste. Tooo costly.
I booked a car cleaning. Nobody at the booked time got in touch to even inform that they can't make it. Eventually I had to reschedule it for next day. The next day somebody calls me and tells me to reschedule it for another day or cancel the booking.
Poor service
Quality service technicians are provided compare to outside.
Worst service provider ever seen. They take the bookings and cancel it at end saying no partners available. Very pathetic service
great app
I am unhappy about the plumbing work. The actual problem was resolved but another problem arose immediately after he left. Another problem is that I book salon service and it's been more than 1 hour and no one arrived. I got a confirmation call in the morning but no one came. I have not option to reschedule to tomorrow. The only available slot is for Saturday. The function is on Saturday. I am really disappointed.
V very unprofessional, not contact able, technicians are thugs, and arogant... today they have just reaffirmed there rating! 04/11/2021 Rating downgrade! 5(-) minus, now UC has gone a step ahed they take a booking and there lol don't turn up nor do they communicate!
I wish I could give less than 1 star. They simply take your booking and never provide service and keep rescheduling the service. Generally I am not the person who writes bad reviews but Urban company compelled me to do so. I did my booking 3 days back for saloon services,in that they rescheduled the service and the next day when I got a call from customer service they are still like working on providing me the service person. Pathetic service by them. Why are they even running.
Not sure about other services, but for electrician issues, it is quite expensive. They impose service charge for each and every thing they do. For a fan connection issue, regulator change, bulb holder change and installation, they charged me 1000 rupees.
An awesome company that has brilliant professionals tied with them!!!
Worth availing facilities
This has become pathetic. They changed the salon for men and divided it into 2 sections of Royale and prime. What's the difference? It's just a hair cut/whatever. A professional will eventually trim the hair/beard as you request him to. And my preferred salon guy has been placed into Royale section increasing the fare almost twice the price and I have been a regular customer. This is some class BS. Not expected of urban company. Lame AF.
U can for get about all civil works by installing this app. Very useful.
Worst experience for each booking.
Good app Nice. I called for sofa cleaning and the work was done professionally.
excellent work done by urban
The professional cancelled right before the service. Not once it's twice ! I have guests coming over today. And what do I do last minute?
Good service!
Not urban company its fake company
Professional services
Very Bad experience
Awesome Services All The Time But Try To Keep Your Charges Low....
Rubbish Service .... once booking done then there is no commitment of the company on services done
very good
I think it should be removed corona safety amount from bills.
Nice app with excellent service as well as customer care
Urban clap made our life easy. You can get all services under one app.
Urban Company is taking booking but professionals are not reaching on time They are doing private bookings on their own and denying to reach on time to Customers who have booked them through Urban clap This is tarnishing the image of Urban Company.
I tried booking home salon 2times in this app.. But none of them is responding.. Time, date everything is scheduled but no professional arrived for service.. Totally disappointed
perfect app with excellent service level. I am fully satisfied with the professional staff and their services.
Worst experience, and that too three consecutive time. I'll never recommend this to anyone
Worst
not good service
well behaviour
I really like her work....happy....
UC Serviis upto customer expectations. Very nice job.
he is very professional and did her job without creating any mess.superb
These beauticians cancel the appointment as per their wishes and we cannot even move back to your original booking. Utterly disappointed and no one from urban company to hear us. This is ridiculous even after paying all money upfront.
Poor services. I scheduled my appointment with advancement payment before three days.still on the day day of appointment they rescheduled it themselves and postponed it after diwali.i needed cleaning services before diwali .even they are charging 50 rs for cancelation inspite of there own mistake.
Very bad bad experience
she took utmost care of every thing,,she was very good
Excellent service we r happy n more than satisfied. Thanks.
It was most horrible. They are the most unprofessional people. I had booked two days earlier but they canceled at the last hour both times. Don't depend on them
The customer service number is not accessible at all! If I have any concerns, they don't cater to them!
Worst . Very Poor Service by their team.
Good service provider
No COD is available
Awesome work by urban company
Scam artists pretending to be technicians. They run a daylight scam where they take the job and ask us to cancel right at the appointed hour. This is to pocket the cancellation fee.
Really pathetic app. Very unprofessional. They took an appointment but nobody came to my door for the services. They wasted my two days of time with their false promises. If your professionals are busy or fully booked why did you even took an appointments? After lot of calls and complaints people from your call centre calls me to compensate my two days of time with hundred rupees!!? Really urbanclap???? This is how you do a customer service?
Initially 4 member arrived and we're actually taking our help in lifting kitchen stuff. In an hour one of them left unanswered. Three of them said they cleaned furniture but while checking it was still full of dust. While asking them they started behaviour unprofessionally , wrapped up and said we are leaving and cancelling service. Just after doing 10% of service they left!!! You should shut your company else it shall be sued. Worst experience ever!
Guys are polite and humble. Like your service. A bit of discount will make us happier now.
very good
Worst service
Very bad experience
Very bad experience. The team did not arrive on time after not telling me they will be 30 minutes late. Not recommended at all
good work..thanks
I what to bring to your notice... Give cash back when we do payment.
Nice
gud service . enjoyed
Such a worst service if their was a zero rating I would have given that rating
For Geyser heating element (Medium/Large)(Theeta product) the cost given in Urban is 1149/- and later when i checked into shop same product cost was 369 n shopkeeper was ready to give at 300 and online its 249. And service guy will tamper the cost and show you outer packing. Only advantage is warranty of 3 months for appliance service. Its upto you what u assume.
Very poor service.. seems they have earned a lot to be shutdown now.. 0 professionalism.. very poor
Pathetic service. Booked an appointment for Home Salon, no professional is available and assigned since 2 days. Better grey out slot timings if professional are not available. Simply waste of time and effort. Negative rating
It is catering for more of my needs so I am happy using this app
It not even allow to access the App. It's not even working this App is not able to send OTP so how can someone use the App.üëé
Pathetic app with no useful customer care services
Highly unprofessional attitude, I booked an appointment but last moment cancelled by urban clap due to unavailability of professionals.
I wish I could rate it negative.
Very poor customer service.. they are rescheduled time with out customer notice.. customer service executive rescheduled today, again professional executive rescheduled after 3days. This is 3rd time.. already I paid total money.. I am suggesting don't book urban company.
ok
Nice
I booked for bathroom clean on 13 September horrible work done my bathroom floor damaged
excellent service
Superb experience..mst be dn atleast once every 6-9 months..
This is our first service request. No hassles , the person came and coolly finished his work and left. Well behaved and gentle.
It's been worst experience with UC for cleaning services. They SEND the professionals even knowing if they are good at his work or not and most awful part is once the professional arrives and start doing their jobs they ask to pay more because as per them the service package rate that's been paid is not accurate. They would start arguing that if we would not do as per them then they would leave the job incomplete. WILL NEVER ANY SERVICE FROM UC IT'S BETTER TO GO WITH LOCAL VENDORS...
she was polite and patient in her work. very Happ with her.
I have given 3 stars because Of the unavailability of Urban Comapny in Rourkela Smart city. You should open a franchise or an outlet in Rourkela too.
Overall UC experience was good but it's little expensive though. Service engineer was so punctual and prompt in his response.
Very unprofessional behaviour, I booked for yesterday the beautician called and said I can not come plz cancel and then some one called from urban clap saying that she is not well, totally unprofessional Then it was rescheduled for today and now again you are not providing facility Plz don't take appointment if you do t have time and make other person suffer because of you Really very bad experience with urban clap Will post on social media also
Zero professionalism, service personnel came without tools and asked me to cancel the booking when I denied for the same he himself canceled it and rescheduled on its own....hopeless service.
Worst service given
Amazing app
Very bad experience. Booked an appointment for salon at home and and they didn't assigned any professional even after the scheduled time and after putting query there I got a call from backend that they will reschedule and confirmed time but after that they didn't turn up on even on call and that scheduled time was also over. If you can't complete your commitments then just don't accept it. I would have gone for other option. Pathetic would never book from this again and recommend others too.
Good
Today without intimating u reschedule my work. No phone numbers or chat option available to talk to anyone. Pathetic service, unprofessional app
very easy and convenient way to get services.
Booked for more than 3 services...all of those cancelled due to profesaional and material not available
Cleaning professionals are horrible. No help from the customer service. Also horrible experience with Refrigerator repair, paid 3500 with no solution.
UC charges Rs. 49/- for saftey purpose but your executives does not wear appropirate standard mask during the service.
Worst experience- pest control not available at 421204 from last several months. Rest all services are available
Worst service application, the person allocated for the service refuses at very end, and you can try calling customer care but no one will pick your call. Waste of your time and money. Will never suggest anyone to book an appointment form this app.
professional handling and expertise in field. keep up the good work
good
Very unprofessional. Neither assigning professional for a booking nor responding to customer calls. Better to pay such a big amount to your local vendors
pest control for bed bugs was ineffective. bed bugs are still there. only reduced a bit. the chemical used seems to be not fully effective
They have disappointed me... On the day of festival.. I totally relied on them.. They did only assign me the time slot and at the time they are saying no professionals available.... So much disappointed .. Pathetic service, you can't even call the customer care directly need to put call back request everytime
Good
Good app
I have booked haircut for my wife, one of the expert Urban company sent Mr Anil Singh. It was really awesome his work, very comfortable he has done his work. Urban company have got Anil goodluck Urban Company.
You sent last person whose name was Sanjay Yadav he cheated me.
Don't book any services .I had booked services.paymet was also done online .they assigned me mrng time ... after in mid night they changedy time ...
improve your professionals
UC assigned clearner on 31st Oct 21's evening then they re schedule without my consent on 1st Nov. 2021 but still I am waiting. I have paid total charges, now I have a single option wait, wait & wait. Never use UC. Very poor commitment.
Booked for Move in Bathroom cleaning .... Paid in advance & the professional provided to me was not vaccinated ... therefore I had to cancel the booking in order to save my family from any unfortunate happening in this difficultCorona times... No reply & response from Urban Company ... No replacement provided ... Another question is How Urban Company can be so irresponsible that they are sending unvaccunated professional at their Customers house ?? Urban Company is playing with the life customer
Worst customer service, i booked the slot and at the end moment executive call and said that no professionals are available i don't know why slots are shown in the app if no professional is available really they are doing unmanageable work, no care for customer's time..
Totally disappointed....unskilled beautician.....I felt that any galli muhlla type beautician they have hired.......again I m really very disappoint with the service by urban company for bathroom cleaning......they are not punctual for there time slot as well as no work quality at all.....very very descriptive üò°
Worst service , booking confirmed two days prior but on day of job , they called to inform me that no person is available , never trust this company if service is needed in emergency. Not worth of one star even . Useless
Worst app, no service is available..
Worst service.so called service expert broken my appliance.No resolution so far when i complained to urban clap customer care.if you have option better to choose local resource rather than taking this service.
Service was excellent.
Pathetic service
Pathetic. Booking always get cancelled as no professional is assigned.
it's second time when I get service from uc, it's nice, satisfied fully, great work.
good exy
Good but not perfect. Their invoice was generated too late.
Horrific service,if i would have got an option of 1star,i would have given that..
Useless. I needed an electrition service the screen kept on turning blank the help centre is also of no help.
The customer care team were very prompt and responded to queries once the issue was raised. Initially there was some miscommunication but it has been taken care of since then. Good services but seem a bit too expensive for basic cleaning services. 5 stars for the change that was made after the initial mishap.
Worst experience ever. I recently order a sofa cleaning service. After the service was done, everything looked good since the sofa was still wet but once it dried up, all the dust was still there as it is. In fact because of the use of liquid, dust spots got acccumulted at one place which ended up looking even more ugly. I even contacted the customer support but it's been more than 24 hours now and no one has contacted back. Never going to recommend such service.
No way to get support on app. Things are not clearly mentioned. Bad app.
Very bad service .The guys cleaned the bedroom first even if I told them to clean kitchen first so that I could cook afterwards. The guy Dutta Kare send three guys for my deep cleaning service but they fooled me by making mess of furniture so that I can't check. They didn't clean kitchen chimney , cabinets ,fans and told that they will revisit if there will work remain .They stand for full payment and didn't go .Now I called them again but didn't come .They cheated me The guy was Datta Kare .
They do have some manpower through service providers but professionals are not trained and do not do an end to end job. Wouldn't recommend as not worthwhile. Pay your help a little more for same results once a year
Back to back 2 times prepaid booking cancelled. Worst service even for prime product and prime customer . They don't have professional, app takes booking only for expensive services and then they cancel it half n hour before . Worst customer care ,worst app . Better to go to a local shop then to go for these app based companies. I wish I could rate zero
Very worst service ever, I booked before 3 days also they failed to provide service. Better close this service instead of wasting time of the customers. Worst app.
Worst service by urban Company. Trust me guys don't book any type of service on this app. Rather go for local services
Total fraud i complain for arro person took 2248 rs put part which is repaired 2nd hand then told me i am going to purchase bolt never come i paid 248 on urban clap and 2000 by paytm urban clap refunded 248 and there is no record of 2000 and booking where i will complain customer care is not working i called to technician he threaten me tp come and beat me i have proof of paytm please help me
Without informing my booking was cancelled. Worst part is that it was scheduled when im not available. I will surely dont recommend this app. And there is no contact support from their side. Worst app
Excellent service in time service hygiene and disposable things very good keep claming uc
Worst experience. Till last minute the app showed that professional will be assigned and after that it just got cancelled. Don't use it especially when you've a scheduled event. Else they'll just cancel and you have to go for alternative.
Good experience. Comfortable. Very nice indeed
Nice and very usefull
When you cannot provide a service you dont have minimu courtesy of informing
Such horrible service is being provided, the professional is not assigned, once assigned he doesn't arrive on time and the same not even informed, the service was scheduled at 2:30, at 5 also professional says it will take time to come this is also informed when we are calling the professional
Urban Clap is always works as my saviour for those last moment festive rush. I always had a great experience for salon services.
worst service provider , other than beautician service ,no professional service are good...never comes on time....worst experience for cleaning professional
The professionals appointed are arrogant and have no regard for the rate card of the company. The company on the other hand have no hold or say on the professionals as they blatantly deny the service, quoting higher than rate card prices. Else, they leave saying they have other bookings. There was a time, not so long ago that this app was a blessing. But, sadly they too seem to be falling prey to the rat race of the number game. They really need to get their act together.
Always Late(hours and hours). Professionals are completely unprofessional(especially Women service). Won't inform you until last minute that they are not available. You should pay cancellation fee if they come late( hours) and you don't have time to proceed. That's Disgusting. Stupid Policies by stupid Companies. Please be careful. Go for payment on delivery. If u pay online they will cut your money in one or other ways while cancellation.
This is 2nd Diwali when you guys have cancelled the booking without making any re-arrangements. Have taken your services many times but this was the last time. Customers only make a business work, you must remember that.
They just cancel your appointment without informing you
This is the 3rd day third time professional did not arrive and I am charged with cancellation fee. Think before using their service. Tried reaching out to customer care, they say we will get back to you and then disappear.
In water proofing service they deserved 0 point . Very irresponsible , not customer satisfaction and behave like they are not professionals.
Third class app..no words to explain
good application for service
Horrible experience in salon services. I have rescheduled an appointment for 3 days in a row and they only inform an hour before the scheduled time that the beautician will not come. Its is a horrible waste of time as they expect us to book appointments in advance and keep rescheduling it again and again and inform only last minute which doesn't allow to make any alternate plans and waste all your time. Extremely pathetic policy of only confirming an hour in advance.
Best
vimla's service was excellent.. Fully Satisfied.. thanks alot.. üëç
The workers were exceptionally great, Abdul the manager was regularly checking on the work and it was finished before the estimated time. I am a very happy customer üòä I will refer Urban to many friends.
Really disappointed. I had booked service for Sunday a day prior and they could not find a single executive for the entire day. Have also not received the refund yet.
I am not against any religion but the guy came from Urban Clap has damage my A.C. and also charged me for circuit and he replaced it with duplicate and also then block my number...so i approached to urban clap but no response at all...worst service i have ever felt...worst... The guys name is Mr. Mohammad Asif Khatiyar and his contact number is 83471 78749. So be aware from this company and guy in Surat, Gujarat, India
Good
Very unprofessional approach towards consumers....the professional didn't turned on time given and company doesn't have any backup plan
Loved it
worst service. No service man assigned for bathroom cleaning.
Disgusting,delay service
They are such a fraud...they charge as much as they want, that is ,double or triple of actual charge and then they won't be able to justify their invoice, that for what they are charging ..such a pathetic experience . Yesterday they came for geyser repairing , the element they installed was of MRP 350 and service charge was rupees 600 ..but they made invoice of rupees 1797 i.e jzt double cost for which they were not even answerable.
Excellent Services rendered by skilled and professionals
Had very bad experience
excellent
They're just cheats who scam you of your money without providing proper service! been fooled by them twice. service very poor and cost is way too high! even if no service is done I'm still charged
Some of the information is not Clear and confusing like bathroom cleaning I select one service but executive told it's one bathroom service not for two, how do we know whether service is for one or two bathroom? Please update the app with clear descriptions. Also rescheduling booking without intimating customer is not good. Please correct that aswel.
I am confident their rating of 4.6 is fraud. They shud not get more then 1star. I Booked for sofa n carpet cleaning 5 days in advance, their service guy dint appear, again after reaching customer care another slot, guy again did not appear n now 3rd time they want us to invite them on Diwali day in evening. If cancel they will deduct money. Wait for a case in consumer court post Diwali u frauds.
very poor
I booked twice for some work,and they didn't even bother to call back when no person was allocated for the same.the last time I booked the service,and the same thing happened,and they didn't even bother to refund my money
great service
awesome experience as expected
Excellent service
Provides on time service but charges way too much and unreasonably.
Best service by Angad very helpful
Happy with the service
amazing service... Full paisa vasool
Timely followup with good service
Worst hair and beauty service experience ever horrible
Urban company people are Fraudsters. The beautician takes up the booking and keeps on canceling at the last moment creating hassle for us. Thats not end of the mental torture. They charge you 50 rs cancelation penalty without any fault of the customer. DO NOT GO WITH THIS FRAUDSTER APP. THEY ARE CHEATERS
Extremely unprofessional service, they rescheduled twice and nobody showed up
Just awesome
I would have given zero if there was an option. They never respond if you register complaint.They called once for name sake and marked resolved on their own without even taking my comfirmation. Later they called and spoke in an arrogant way. Today 2nd nov after 6 months I have again lost Rs 3500 due to their inefficiency.They are more inclined to support their cheat professional who looted my Rs 3500.Roadside companies are better.UC is a bunch of daylight robbers.Never ever take their service
I had booked a plumber through this app they had assigned a plumber who never arrived at a given schedule had to make 15 calls he randomly lifts calls and gives excuses of 5 minutes on my way,10 minutes on my way I had to cancel as my requirement is a emergency I had to hire a local plumber from a hardware shop now this is a lesson for me not to rely on companies
you are looking my money
Opted for salon services. Very convenient & user friendly app.
Over pricing: only tap adopter was placed with in 5 min and paid almost 230
Worst app ever. They are cheaters. Will take money from you. Professional are very poor trained, illitrate and of rude negligent behaviour. They never come on time. Make xyz excuses. And when you ask for refund they return only partial amount. My problems never got resolved instead of investing so much time and energy. It's a fraud application. Save your self.
Cheated. No one came. Money deducted.
Great and incase any issue exist very prompt action
Wonderful and Ontime service.
Horrible service
Worst experience with urban company Don't book any professional as they refuse to do the service Don't book from urban company It's waste of time n money
Rohit came from UC. he was thorough professional.
App is easy to use. Leaves no scope for confusion.
Very nice
Dharvendra Name person came to my home to repair fully automatic top load washing Machine.I gave him 1500 Rs for repairing nd he Assured that if any problem found after repairing he ll come nd fix the issues. Now that I m calling him ,he is neither answering my call,further more he blocked my number too.worst experience.I want compensation. Pls help me.I m a single parent nd already facing financial crisis ,for me 1500 is quite a big amount. Pls help me out
Fraud company doesn't honour bookings, refunds and even no customer support/ call back facilities...app is pathetic as it doesn't function either
Pathetic service and very unprofessional customer care. My booking was rescheduled 4 times and still I get a call that professional is not available. UC staff if you cannot commit to the needs of the customer atleast don't waste our time by accepting the booking.
Unprofessional people cancled my appointment 4 times when you don't have professional why you first accept appointment pathetic
After having a massage session. I got bruises on my neck and headache. I am never going to use this service again. Disappointed.
No timeline for visiting technican only this is being reshudled again and again
Baƒè experience
Always show error when i tried to booking
Poor service ,fake promises ,My bathroom is not at all cleaned properly.Though the money was paid in advance ,The concerned person didn't even turned on allocated time .I want them to send someone to clean the bathroom again
Ekdum nakali company urbanclap
no good service .. I was busy in other works . later saw no good work
What is the use of app...If after booking 2 days before also you cant send the professional? Basic need of app is itself not being fulfilled... uninstalled
Cctv service not provide in KOLKATA. Please start the service in kolkata I can't re book.... Don't have customer service number
Very poor not satisfied at all
Bad service. No experience worker No skill
Pathetic service, urbun clap only booked .but they have not capable to manage or provide required services . Moreover all professional of company have busy for whole time. As per my point of veiw customer care personnel is very good they gives the solution of every query in sape of sorry. Because they have no other options for customer accept sorry. Bad services over all.
DON'T TRUST!! The beautician stole my diamond ring and the company has not taken any action. Good for nothing.
For refrigerator water leakage I took service they charged around 2500. Then after 2 days of repair it started over freeze problem even it is in low. I never see this problem previously. When ever I call they will say environment is cool. So it's cool. They are not coming to check. Worst service.
Recently I got my home painting done from Urban Company. Mr Pradeep Gupta and his team have delivered superior services beyond my expectations. He has truly made a difference in the way painting work is normally carried out. Starting from cleaning the walls, painting, organizing things back to their places and many more things are worth appreciating. God bless him, his team and urban company. Thank you very much.
must try
Never choose urban company during festival time.... They took bookings but nobody comes... And no information given and no response from them
The people who came cleaned the bathroom floor using some chemical s ....my entire bathroom floor is spoilt ...I don't how to contact them back.... pathetic job done by them
Pathetic response. Local expert is more answerable and responsible than urban company. Very disappointing. I urge everyone that don't take service from urban company. They just make false commitments only.
Excellent
During festive season services are off in our area.
Unexplained and inordinate delay. I scheduled a booking for cleaning today at 3 pm. However, no professional is yet appointed. No follow up. No information. You keep waiting but no one is appointed and when when you request for a call back someone calls after 41/2 hr to inform no professional abailable. With so much planning one schedules and then they cannot keep their commitment. They take the money in advance. Even if it is refunded, what about the compensation for harassment.
good work
Work is not good
Pathetic service totally unsatisfied.....I booked leg n hand waxing for my mom when I called Shraddha Tiwari (one of thre service provider) n movement they refuse and said she have already one booking at same time so she refused...... When I try to cancel my booking they charge 50rs.
offline servicing would be less costly
Good and esy to use. Could improve the UI a little bit
superb, helpful, convenient....
Worst service...they charge when customer cancel and when professional doesn't come..neither customer service attends Ur call or agent. Just waiting for customers to cancel and charge customer back
Worst customer experience.Professionals did not arrive whole day I was trying to contact them.. Complete disappointment. And the customer care also did not call for any solution.
Thoroughly satisfied by the service.
Service was very good and neat and clean
No professionals available in Dombivali, trying to find technician for water purifier and pest control since one month.
I am sorry to use this app this company has no staff this company is totally fraud please never üôè use this company service
Very bad service. Had book mattress cleaning 3 days back. Till today no one has come. I keep getting number of calls every day saying will be sending today and again a call with new time. Today I got a call at 6:30 am asking to send at what time. Really unprofessional service provider.
Good job done
Bad service
Worst customer service ever
Pathetic. They collect advance for home cleaning and last moment people don't turn up
They respond at all ..and the worst part after conformation of booking..there professional don't come at all..very worst service..mainly deep cleaning not at all preferable
The services provided by UC is great. I would suggest to utilise their services for various types of jobs.
Urban Clap services are really good.
good haircut
Booked a service, yet no professional is ready . Indore uc has failed as a team .
Available after complaint
Very bad service
It's a one stop for all work.
Professional did not arrive at all. very poor service. he did not even pick up the phone. I called up around 30 times.. but no one picked the call.. and not even cared to call back and kept on disconnecting phone.
Very worst take confirmation forbooking then denined last movemnet & give refund after deduction without taking any service.
I booked deep home cleaning for Friday, when UC people arrived they realized that their vacuum not working and they couldn't do any cleaning. Now when I have scheduled it for Monday but not responce from UC. Neither received any call from them. Even after putting call back requests no response. Also they have deducted some booking amount of Rs 500. Don't know how this will be refunded.
Good customer service
I book my package but beautician not find by company...what the hell r u doing ...then why u accept payment...now I want my money back right now
Overall Very Nice Experience of using this app.
Great service...
No service provideas per schedule
First order. No service on time. Completely unacceptable. Finally, had to cancel.
Worst experience. Booked for salon serivce , the beautician did not even bothered to answer call or came for the service.
Worst service provider......
Very bad service of urban company. My first service was good, So I had booked for cleaning at 2pm today still no body has Came. It is already 3pm Mr Bablu Dodwe has been assigned for the work but has not yet come neither he is picking up the phone. His phone is switched off. Highly disappointed. Not up to the mark of Urban Company. Cannot and will not recommend to others. Sorry not eligible for 1 star also
Over charge
Very much disappointed with the hair color which was done by your so cld professional Archana mutharaj on 29 oct ..the hair color done the nxt day only the color started fading. Waste of money
the CS and the behaviour of the entire team is harrowing. postponing my service request and 18 phone calls that lead to 6 hours of my precious time wasted is below the belt service. but the person Sushant who came to clean was efficient and the best in his work.
Very bad. Have given complaints. Every time they say we called u. But not recd any call. My tile colour has changed. No response fro. The company
Poor app
Worst company service and customer support
I'm happy with the customer service that they give. I posted my query in the review and the team took the action of connecting and responded in very short span, also, resolved my issue. Reliable.
Nice experience
excellent work ,truly satisfied with the service.Sunil tambe was very polite and well behaved.
Beautician assigned fail to respond and urban company has zero reliability. Company fine us 50/- for cancelling or rescheduling after beautician is assigned and a verbal apology if beauticians are ignoring us and then you keep waiting for them. This is highly unprofessional on company's behalf. Urban company cancelled the booking and still charged me 50 Rupees. Please avoid this app as their motive is to loot you.
Do avoid this app for any kind of services as they may cancel your prepaid bookings at very day you are suppose to receive and your money will be stuck with them for 5-7days after the cancellation from there end. So avoid this and if you have to then dnt pay online.. atleast you wil recieve the service and if not your money won't be blocked
Poor customer service. Actually very poor customer handling service. They respond when you write on social media otherwise when the same review was mentioned on their private app, there was no communication.
Your Service level has gone down... unfortunately this is reality of most company's like you when you provide excellent service to start and than drop to lowest either you need to increase your manpower or get rid of the options you have listed in the app ...it's seriously waste of time booking the slot and not getting the service..
Am really unhappy with the urban service.. Last year feb 9 2020 I took service of bridal. Makeup.. I paid the amount in cash.. However by mistake gave cheque to the lady.. After 1.9 years the same lady calls and says I didn't pay her for the service goes to the bank thank God the cheque was not valid. Request urban team to take some action. Thank you
excellent work
best for beauty and electrician services
Worth seviceüëç keep it up
Great service
Disappointed. The service professional never turned up. The customer care executive kept rescheduling and postponing the appointment. Finally, he cancelled the booking. Why do you guys take the booking when the service professionals are not available??
This is my first time booking a service here and had the worst experience. Firstly I booked atleast a week ago for my service and at the day of service no professional was assigned to me even after 1 hour of the allotted time. When I contacted the customer service, the lady (Ms. Nidha) rescheduled my booking for the next day. But they didn't even come tye next day. They don't even have a proper contact number where I can complaint. Customer service also doesn't pickup calls. Extremely disappoint
I had booked a carpentar for pigeon mesh in the month of June, since the pigeon are still coming,I have been trying to contact the carpenter since then, but either he does not pick up or will keep dealying that I will come tomorrow which has been like 5 months. He had assured us that the pigeons will not come..work not completed properly and no response..not happy with the service
Poor communication, no proper customer care contact. No response. Professionals will be lieing.. Very very bad
Whatever the job assigned to the team are doing perfectly
Very bad service.Dont book urban company.
very professional
I had a bad experience at my last service.. I want to contact the call center.. but no option to contact them
Unprofessional Urban company is faltering on its service commitments. Professionals don't turn up and urban company has no clue, no mechanisms to help. I hv to waste time talking to ppl who are repeating same lines like parrot without trying to get solution. They are not able to scale up. I'm looking out for alternatives to move away from this waste of time and money.
good job
I didn't got the refund even though I cancelled my order within 24 hours request to send me my refund as soon as possible
Very bad experience today üôè
good cleaning solution except extra charges what the take
Good
good and prompt service
I am very unhappy with both the cleaning services bathroom as well as kitchen... Bathroom cleaning guy used chemicals on my metalic knobs and hooks and all have rusted. Kitchen cleaning couple didnt even clean the floor tiles and sink and walls.. They are all sooo dirty..
1. App does not give any option of available date, it just says no professional available in your area. 2. Availability must be shown prior to membership. UC takes money for membership and says it is nonrefundable. 3. Rs 49 per service is hidden charge for UC safety. It should be shown on home page. 4. Professional denied the service and says to cancel the service, UC cuts Rs 50 for this too.
Excellent service !!
For 50/- rupee light, please pay 300/- rupee for installation. And yes they will help you with putting one nail, obviously hand gloves or face mask bhe pehnenge, not because they want to be safe.. but 100/- rupee extra. Kudos to Uc pricing team. Happy Diwali.
Both people who came for cleaning did their job well.
As per my recent experience with Urban Company, I paid the service amount in advance but service advisor didn't visit at the scheduled time and I had to cancel the services. Urban Company didn't reverse the entire amount which got deducted from my account and there is not further help from the customer support, they neither have a solution for it nor any Matrix to escalate the matter. Pathetic customer experience.
Good work
V had bkd for bathroom cleaning on 30.10.21. Mr.Parvez Ahmed has done d job good but v didn't notice tht he has damaged our property (washing machine) while cleaning. Pls help us resolve d issue.
I m very disappointed as my payment was failed and its more than 2 weeks now, it didn't refund yet...I called many time but no respond at all... After put all efforts no refunded at all so never book any service from urban company until refund process not done.
App keeps on hanging ,it's not reliable, I am trying to raise a complaint ,it is not opening properly.
Unhappy with kitchen cleaning...top cabinets not neatly cleaned ...white patches observed next morning.really expensive ..
Worst experience on Pest control. They won't bother to call back as well. No option to initiate the complaint on Platform once u r done with the service.Needed refund but nobody called back
Good
Great and professional service
Great service at your door step.
Really excellent
Many services has not been included. Also not happy with the first service that I received .
Third class service and 0 coustomer satisfaction policy
good service
Excellent service and coordination
I really need more facial options on urban company.
Froude hai
They charged me ...no service.
Its a pefect service app
Very bad services. Earlier booked for 26th oct. The person come had denied to do the work. Now booking was for today .The concerned still not come at given time. Very shemful for the company. I would like to continue with my old complaint and version. Your coordinator had told us to get cancelled old one and book new hirerange MOVEIN package. My son booked that on 26th. They give date of 30th oct morning. Again same story continue. The person not come . They reschedule but still work not done.
Pathetic. I have used the app once and the booking was rescheduled without even asking for the same. No customer service contact number to raise the queries. No means to communicate with the customer service center. And the worst part is the only the booking is rescheduled but the service is still pending to be completed. I cannot recommend this app to anyone if there is no means to communicate with the company.
Good one. However all depend upon the agent who come at site for job. If they do well then only customer get satisfied and give good rating.
üëåüëç
Very unhappy with the quality of service. First not able to provide service on the given date and second the professional not trained.
Good app but sometimes doesn't work
They can reschedule appointment when service not required And most important thing no one come at scheduled time slot Last but not least customer care executive oblige us by refunding full amount Now this message will be replied to ask me to send my problem separately but it will never be resolved
Very poor customer support. Took money in name of lock day still not able to deliver service and they don't have customer care number so you are at your own if executive not come. And without call send message that will now call u after two hour. Pathetic.
worth for money
Best
very nice
Pathetic experience with these folks
Thank you Urban Company for excellent service üëèüòÄ
Dhokha Dene wali company
thanks Rambabu
Very nice.. I am so happy
Till your don't try there service you won't understand why I gave 5 star. Try once.
Very good service, nice experience
very helpful
This is the issue I have faced 2 times. It's such a shame in the name of Urban Company. You guys cancelled booking at the last moment and during this holiday time that too not once but twice. I am never going to book any bookings again with Urban compan again. This review is in regards with Reenu Kumari, this technician called me 30 minutes back and cancelled my booking after taking confirmation from me on the confirmation call. It's a planned cancellation twice to malign Urban Company's name.
The things which are written in the app doesnot show correct things I called for kitchen cleaning and the man told only slaps and tiles are included where in the other side app was showing whole kitchen will be cleaned
Very pathetic and last moment denied for service's
Awesome
Good experience
Used 5 times. Ended up with blisters twice. Rest of the times, cane late and with half the stuff needed for service
Poor service. You will keep waiting for professionals till the schedule time and then urbancompany will send a apology mail. Very poor Experience and should no how to manage the incoming orders.
Very unclear nd ambigious packages I tried booking bathroom cleaning Came to know the bathroom cleaning dosent include bathtub, wash basin, toilet seat stains, bathroom mirror cleaning And nowhere on their app they have mentioned this that whats included and whats not at the time of booking the package On asking the customer service centre was told that all this is not included On asking where it is mentioned, was told its not mentioned and was not informed but we still wont do it. 0 stars for u
Less staff during festives so be careful while taking uc option
ecilent
After booking the slot its been cancelled by UC partner,if UC is concerned about it customers,UC should have arranged alternate for the same time,UC should value the time of people,by just refunding payment does'nt make sence
nice
Not happy with the carpenter service.he did nt complete the wrk
Now these people have become very unprofessional.They accept the booking and dont provide beautician and other professionals. Even don't show basic courtesy to call back to resolve query.These people will treat you properly in the beginning but once you become regular customer then they will start taking you for granted.Specially in festive season, you can't trust these people.They can delay cancel and unassigned professionals and waste your day. Better to go to salon and get the service done.
Done excellent work
The professionals are never available. Tried booking so many times but no use. They say that they will notify but they dont.
Worst experience I ever had. No customer care response. Refuse to give service on time even after more than 1 hour and rather asking for cancellation fees.
Good and experienced people.....have adequate knowledge to do the work....timely completion of activity
Kind of scam , usually professional denies duty within 2 hoyrs of time slot so that 50rs can be deducted by customers account. Instead if this app kindly prefer justdial
Very pathetic service. Why you take appointments if you don't have any beautian avaible with you.. I have booked 3 days prior, and in the last moment you are saying beautian is not available..what were you doing these 3days? Atleast you guys should have courtesy to inform the client but no. None of your teammate called unless I requested them to call me back.. These kind of service make me think hard if I should promote you or not.. False promises by UC Escalation Team.. Very much Disappointed.
UC is still not able to solve my problem. I paid fulll amount of Rs40352 before starting work..for which I want a receipt.I received a call from the help team stating that the finance team will get in touch with me but regret that till now I.e after 3 days I have not got my re eipt which is very unfortunate
No on time service / professional provided!
All professionals are knowledgeable and execute their work meticulously.
The biggest fraud ever... So they take bookings with pre payment and waste your entire day and call you 30mins after the appointment time has passed to inform you they have no-one available for your service because they overbooked..help centre is a joke ...no customer service whatsoever..
Very bad service for booked boys they really don't know how to work Urban Company recruiting non professional persons I really suggest everyone to don't book electronic professionals
good app
You do not even deserve a 1star rating. You promise a booking slot and then are unable to find service providers to deliver on that. Then you call and ask for extra time and give the customer an inconvenienced time which you know customer may not accept and constantly keep saying I can't do much other than apologize. Then customer escalates, your escalation team calls and when the customer is complaining and asking for a solution u hang the phone down and cut the line on customer. Pathetic.
If there was a option to select zero star i would have done that. I had booked the services for Sofa cleaning , and payment was also done online. It was iformed while booking that same will get assigned before 1 hour of my scheduled time. But there was no curtesy from Urban clap to even call me inform me. When i called urban clap there executive informed on the scheduled time that service can not be done today and tomorrow you can pick any slot after that. Really pathetic service and organising
heena is good & very polite behavior...service was also good
Well behaved staff who knew their job and performed well up to our satisfaction
Cheap fraudsters These people abruptly cancel the appointment for home cleaning... Also used the painting services They should rename their company name... "No service available as per commitment Compay"
Giving 1 Star as No Option to give -Ve Rating. I haven't seen any such unprofessional service and the scam being run in lieu of reschedule and cancellation charges are icing on the cake!
Pathetic service. Unprofessional people.
Services too costly..Company should lower the service costs a bit.
Well trained professionals and good committed to work.. must try
Awesome experience
it's very helpful ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Cancelling my booking
Pathetic experience ,no customer care no one bothers to call...stupid service
There was a professional fault so I booked for revisit within the time and it showed free service These people again after revisit charging the amount worst experience with urban company don't prefer it guys
Very professional and did cleaning as expected
Professionals assigned need to have more knowledge about their job. Also ,there are lots of hidden costs.
Excellent service with skilled workers, A1
great job üëè üëç üëå
Product quality was very poor.i have itching and iritation problem by your product
Not reliable for cleaning services. Very unprofessional behaviour.
Sundays are always not available to book one day before.
Services from this app are not worth... people have gone from bad to worse... in the process of customization can't even book services properly
Very good & Excellent Services
very bad professionals...took advance payment...+ blocked my number + incomplete service....FRAUD COMPANY
There is no customer care number to contact in case of any issue
excellent work
Really disappointed with the service. Scheduled a salon at home service but after 2 hrs of waiting they were not able to assign anyone nd at last moments they made exuses to change ur plan.worst service.
Can not call to customer care in any requirement because there is no number of care. After refusing to take service from perticular technician company sand same guy again .brevo zulu
these days bunch of losers are getting associated as service partner in urban clap, no control over service by urban
Urban Company is continually improving their services! I have given 4 stars and left 5th star to allow window for future improvements! Some professionals who come for services are awesome, but some are bookish and some are talkative and some deliver less quality! And some have combined behaviours! People training on soft skills is much needed! This is an opportunity cost for Urban Company!
Not so good cleaning. Kept a watch on them continuously and need to show them what to do. Still they left many things unclean.
Very bad experience. Bad profesionals send.
In my observation, very good service by Urban Company on behalf of its staff.
Excellent
Techicians all time not so experianced, please appoint proper technicians, who can understand and solve that problem, however local technician will beappriate as u appointed in yoir company.
No support and pathetic service specially about the plumbing. For any service you will not have anyone from support that's worst case.
worst app.... really disappointed... professionals dont come even after confirmation. They cancel it at very last moment and wont even inform u before cancelling the confirmed service and urban company executives wont do anything about it ...very unprofessional..this has happened to me 5 or 6 times...and everytime urbna company executives will say sorry and give us a chance but again they are failed to deliver their promise...wont recommend urban company to anyone.. .deleting this app rght now
Hidden charges included. Took extra service charge. Just to fit one adapter they took Installation Charge, Service Charge plus spare parts. This is highly unprofessional.
Urban Company is the worst start up that ever started. Though the app seems beautiful, their service sucks. Their workers whom they call professionals, knows nothing about the professionalism. They don't even care to contact the customer before canceling the service. Furthermore, there is no way we can contact the service centre.
The worst app ever! They won't let u even select a date and you get a message saying no slots right now! But I don't want a slot right now just let me select from available options and then give an error
UNPROFESSIONALUSM AT ITS PEAK
I was impressed with bangalore service never had any issues in the past couple of years. From home cleaning to salon to spa all was taken care of. And now that I have relocated to Delhi, I should say I am back here to edit my rating from 5 to 1. Very bad experience. I took membership thinking u would be getting bangalore level service here but I am shocked to see the customer service r of no help. The professional just didn't turn up after making me wait for 2 and half hour. Payment issues...
Believe me guys ....worst service they provide .....no professionalism...ppl who came were untrained n unprofessional ...thease are thegurls from nearbuy place just 12or 10th passout worked in an local parlour ....n if you ask they will ask you to call personally then they will do properly......totally garbage stuff here in noida n ghaziabad
Very poor service.. also they'll try to make a fool out of you by providing you some membership. So beware. They show you the available time slots and then back off.. deduct your money for no reasons. Never going to opt for this.Very poor experience. Disappointed!!
Hi The service is very good but there is a flaw in your App. I booked my own package worth Rs 699 consisting of 1 Men's Haircut, 1 Tan Removal Mask and 20 min Head massage. I also booked Deep Action clean up for Rs 299. Now I came to know its not Clean up at all but only scrubbing and de tan mask so I ended up paying twice for one de tan mask. When I booked this, your representative should have called and cleared this issue. Who is going to refund me money for detan mask?
Worst company, pathetic UC partners and 0 standards of customer care
Worst service ever. Will never recommend
Very nice and good
We had requested for cleaning service. But no one came, nor we received any message from the company regarding why people are not coming
They took the booking and then cancel the booking on the spot . No calls no information . Even the payment option was also prepaid . Very very disappointing.
very good initiative both for customers and employees. Developing skills and generating employment
Plus member are eligible for 20% discount but they are cheating to customer by providing only 60 rs against my booking of rs 900
Nice culmination of services and info
People don't turn up for service
Urban Clap's cleaning services are exceptional! I wish they would start some organising service too.
Not worthy of giving a single star but had to as it is mandatory. Extremely disappointed with Urban Company. Last minute service cancellation during festive time leaves the customer in a big dilemma. This happened to me recent when by home cleaning services were cancelled multiple times. Ideally, if they do not have enough manpower the bookings should not be taken. Would recommend people of you are looking to book services from UC, keep alternatives ready as you might need it at the minute.
Urban company and its commitments don't mean a thing. I have had 4 bookings cancelled or non-serviced in the past 1-2 weeks. I am uninstalling the app. Please refund my money at the earliest possible. Absolutely unprofessional. People have plans which you don't respect.
They say they give genuine spare parts. But guess what? They don't. And if we go back to them later, they hold up the 90 day warranty period, even if we can prove that the spare part provided earlier is fake!!
Service is not proper on time, scheduled slots are canceled and the company asks for reschedule and they say rescheduled slot is also not availaible. Worst service. We had to attend a function without grooming, worst service donot apt it before u attend an event because its unpredictable if u get the service or not
Bhagyashree is a professional beautician üëåshe talk politely and provideded excellent service to me
We booked for apartment deep cleaning from UC 5 days prior and they did not assign any professional till the last minute.. even asking us to wait for some more time. Very unprofessional and now we have to find people to clean at last moment as we r free only on sundays. This was not excepted from unicorn company.
I am very disappointed from the customer care.book home cleaning but still professional not assigned and nor they are reaponding
Technician is good.
Address setting is a big head ache! It's not accurate. And not able to edit my addresses. Its supposed to be a basic feature.
Booked salon service one week earlier but was cancelled on last minute by the assigned professional by giving absurd and lame reason . The professional was late for service and to prevent poor rating and price cut after that she planned cunningly and cancelled the service. Pathetic service.
Excellent service
The beautician which uc have send was not good
The main purpose of using Urban Clap that we can book technician according to our time but they stopped sending technician on time. They are scamming the customer.
Not satisfied at all. If your sofa is in light colour and having strains, professionals not able to clean it and giving any reasons. What's the use of cleaning by professionals then and spending lots of money. I would recommend not go with any of services with this company.
I fully paid the amt and booked yesterday for today's 10 am .but no body turned up. I had to cancel my booking . 1 st time I did and very bad experience
The app doesnt allow to book mulitple services at the same time. I can't book hair cut for my son & facial for myself at the same booking transaction.
Excellent
Why you all delete my review this is my 2nd time I'm giving review, the worker asked to cancel and if we cancel then you charge 50 rupee. Once you become famous that doesn't mean you will do lile this your workers are so bad and your service too.
I m not satisfied your cleaning, very much dissapointed.
I booked Sofa Cleaning Service a day in advance, which was delayed by one day by their so called Professional. Thereafter, he didn't show up at all. Urban Company apologized for such behaviour and called me rescheduled the booking twice but I never got any confirmation of booking again. I guess, their service too is like their professionals. Bogus.
Last minute cancellation without prior information, they make us pay in advance then cancel the services, no solution even of services are booked well in advance .
good service provide bycompany
Why to use your membership.. everytime you are charging for PPE KIT VACCINATION N ALL ,some time it has to stop ,now almost everyone has got vaccination still you are charging 40 rps everytime.. looting of general public
Very poor service....
Poor service
Very despointed,staff behaviour is very bad ,they denied for every services....money waste.and when complain to customer support they also denied and talk Badly.they blocked our no ,so that I can't call them.
Very professional service by Mohd Salman. He was punctual. Did his job totally to my satisfaction. Highly recommended for a nice smooth haircut and thorough head nech and shoulder massage.
Stop removing feedback/reviews. Improve serviPlz do not buy the membership. It's a waste of money. Doesn't matter if it's a membership or premium service, they would send the same rated Customer service is the worst. Doesn't even connect with customer service and no one would ever call no matter how many complaint u log. Membership is a complete waste of money. Moreover, customer service team would send a preformated templet to show that they replied. But after that they disappear like a ghost.
I had book for ac service they they sad it can't be served best new maganic comes and done that
Raja and team did excellent job...they clean each and everything...
Excellent service
Pls. Try in Salem tamilnadu. There is a high demand for technicians.
Sorry... But My experience of kitchen cleaning was not satisfactory. If i pay just 50% amount to my maid.. she can do much better.
They are not any work and take 353 /- for only visiting charge
Fraud company. Don't waste your time. I booked cleaning services,the lady didn't turn up and switched off the phone. Lodged a complaint but they didn't respond. The customer service girl who finally reached out after days promised a compensation but that didn't reach me either. Harassment and time waste

Pathetic experience.. the Salon professional told us UC did not provide them with enough product quantity to do the task properly.. Shame on you Urban Company for stooping so low..
Very good..understood my requirement
I didn't get my refund yet i cancelled my booking on 7 oct 21 still I m waiting for refund bakwas hain ye app fraud people
excellent work
wow
excellent company, great staff. thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Not at all satisfaid with the service ... Pathetic experience
Good service
professional stuff
good
Love the work you guys are doing, just provide some more offers
Very very poor help service. Your professional might not show up for hours, lie , blow up your switch board, cleaning service wouldn't arrive and you would have to wait three days for the rescheduled service or pay a fine because the professional didn't arrive.
Very cordial, skilled and efficient.
good job
Always had a great experience
Excellent
I booked a salon service for 6 p.m.& received confirmation from the call centre with the details of the beautician assigned to me. I received a call from the beautician at 5:55 p.m. informing me that she will be reaching by 6:45 p.m.since she's with another client. Well did she not now this while taking the appointment or atleast 30 minutes prior to the scheduled time? Highly unprofessional behaviour. Tried this service for the 1st time. Don't think I did the right thing.
Recently, I booked for washroom cleaning 3 days in advance but on the scheduled day no body turned up and customer care was also not able to help. Definitely , not a professional approach.
Excellent
Worst app ever . 100% unprofessional. Never book any services if you are totally dependent on UC. After booking they will confirm you 5 times that person is coming and in evening 5:30 they will simply say Sorry
Excellent Service. Worth for Money. Thank you.
So far nice and had a healthy atmosphere with the people who ever gave me the services so far I recommend this app for my family members to .too good and to useful
Technician visit was not at the scheduled time. New issue started after the service. No follow ups from UC on service quality, after payment is done
good service
Worst Company . Fraud. They have accepted my booking and amount 7047 for full house deep cleaning on 30th. October at 12 pm. But when the time came , no body came for the work . They haven't assigned any person for my work . No call response nothing. Never go for this company ..... They all are bloody bastard cheat .
Nice
Pathetic service. I booked for a home cleaning service for my 3BHK the professional comes and tells me your house is not empty you need to opt for other service while there is no option to choose an empty house in the app. He says my house is bigger than a 3BHK, I mean what non sense! And you guys rescheduled my service without my consent even bad. Definitely not recommended guys. Very very poor. I wanted to get my home cleaned before diwali and these guys are rescheduling it as per their wish.
Cheaters, fraud service,no professionals ,only false promises, taking bookings for service but no body comes for service,urban company patna is fraudulent
Did Washing machine service in Urban company 4 days still they have not done the repair even reported the customer care service provider still no update. Even I have membership for last 2 years they won't be able to make it.
Good
satisfactory
The professionals are very irreposible
So disappointed with the service. I blocked bathroom cleaning and windows cleaning . And considering diwali , I booked the services two weeks early. Bayhroon cleaning is not upto the mark. I had to keep guiding the professional Plus after cleaning there are white marks of surf everywhere which I had to clean anyways. And the service for windows cleaning got rescheduled three times and finally due to unavailability of so called professionals I had to cancel it .
Two times cheated..
Excellentüëå
It is good but ..some points are lacking ... -Females are not trained much needs more experienced girls -If you need honest Feed back then send after one hour job done so people can give honest feed. -Give option column when you assign the duty for same professional Required trained Females saloon staff -lBefore assign the duty pls Ask first costomer first if he / she repeat the service of same employee - need demo video of each service.. females of saloon perfessional need more training
Waste service provider ever , no direct customer care no , the technical person who came did not leave the house until I have to give him 4 star , he took hostage situation in my Home , what kind of services are you providing.üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°. No coordination with video consultant with the physical consultant . He should have updaed the issue to the physical consultant before closing the job .
Very bad service
Not a good service provider.
Prompt and Timely Setvice with Professionals
Worst service
Worst company...worst service..there seems to be disconnect between comapny and agency..pathetic service ..get it done from local service provider...these aggregators are pathetic
I booked ur company for cleaning but very sorry to say that I didn't get service even after rescheduling thrice.very very bad experience. If you can't give service on time then why did u keep the slots open? Shame on ur service, will take the matter to the media
Bad professionalism by the assigned urban clap professional. The person didn't turn up for the service and not even taking my calls. Even we can't track the location provided by Urban clap. The online customer support is pathetic as we have to wait for 60 minutes to get a call back.
Unprofessional behaviour nobody can come on time even they cancel booking on hand no
Super
Very helpful
Pathetic service by this company in terms of customer satisfaction, the cleaner came to clean my fridge totally damaged the door, filed complaint but no response from the company.
Pathetic, the interest they have in collecting money is not shown on other aspects. No proper customer care ,assigned supervisor says I have informed company that I cannot attend but still they are putting my name. Urban clap do you call this professional service üëè
Extremely horrible experience. They kept on rescheduling appointment until i got fed up and cancelled the service request.
Tried ur maid services .....very very satisfied üòå The maid tht came for me was telissia ...very competent and efficient üåü ü§©
Service charges are too high and these guys don't offer combined services. For eg.for geyser installation you ll need both a plumber & electrician....you ll have book both of these services separately due to which the final cost alongwith the material cost turns out to be too high.
superb
This was my first time using urban company. 15 min before the scheduled time the agent informed us the service can't be provided. I had guests arriving the next day so couldn't reschedule. Had to come to the conclusion to cancel it. After that i received a text that i will be charged 50 rs for canceling. When it wad the professional who denied to come. Never using urban company again. Not trust worthy...
nice app
Not getting refund money back
Totally unprofessional. This is my 2nd time I booked and the service not provided. There is no customer service provided. None bothers to even contact customer or solves.
Pathetic experience Not once but 3 times... Urban Company is horrible
Worst service.. not on time.. help desk not responding
Booked for house cleaning a week in advance and they didn't provide the service on the day they had to. Waste of time.
Not fit to be called as professionals
she is very friendly and excellent at her job.
Nice & very good work. Extremely satisfied
Highly unprofessional company. Would advise nobody to take services from them. They don't have any commitment and failed all times. Best part is they accept it easily.
Really disappointed.They have so many services but don't have professional for that service. After taking booking they cancel at the last moment and inform that we don't have professional for this service.Your money also get stuck.Very unprofessional behaviour if they don't have professional atleast they should inform prior.
Professional don't arrive and cancel your booking at the end moment,never ever trust them and wait for them,it's a total failure company who claims to be at your service but never show up.
So u don't have a customer care service or phone number that I can contact? The professional assigned to me is working as per his schedule. I have some clarification regarding order. I called him but his voice couldn't be heard properly which I totally understand. But other than that I have no way to contact user company? I mean. I don't know.
Unprofessional. Deserves 0.5rating. Why take orders when you cannot assign the right people for the job. Calling 15mins before the appointment slot just to say you want to cancel? Pathetic. Going by the latest reviews seems like the issue is the same across all cities and all services. Why promote your services on social media platforms and via "influencers" if you cannot handle the logistics. Highly disappointed.
I am surprised by the service not received by the professionals .They either do not have the products nor do they have PPE kit . They always ask the customer to cancel service .No option to reach to customer care and talk
A little over priced... but services are good
Why urban company stop doorstep car cleaning???
They are pathetic service providers as far as time lines are concerned. They reschedule/cancel service without prior intimation to you even for advance payment cases. No way you Can approach the customer service centre...
Pathetic service. Unprofessional people. Shabby work.
They don't even have a call center you can reach, when you have a concern with the professional. And they clearly know that the professional has not yet checked-in
How do I contact your customer care have some queries regarding a service?
Worst management and service in Patna! Unprofessional behaviour and incompetent staff
Very poor service . Kitchen very badly done . Dry area missed out .
excellent work
Bogus company with high profile cheating
This was 2nd time I Booked for cleaning service ..no professional was assigned till the booking time... service is getting bad day by day
I have decided to be super critical as an user. There is a huge location issue with this app. I have noticed this a couple of times. Even when I change the location before booking, it always booked in some other location. The default location doesn't update, you have to manually set Use my location.
Very unprofessional & useless company. Just shut down your services Despite the negative reviews I booked your service. Yet you have again done the same thing. Just close your company
Waste of time when u can't value customers time why this bleady app is still existing when slots are not available why do u accept booking by wasting our time
Worst service ever. Never get Deep home cleaning done by theny unless you want to get your house more dirty. The customer support is pathetic, if you raise a complaint, you get no call back and they automatically close the ticket raised. Waste of money time and efforts.
There is a no. Contact no. Worst experience
good service at an affordable price... ... whenever I have a work I usually book urban company
Consistently great service by UC professionals - company has put great efforts in executing the services to great details.
Payment channels are pathetic. They have to learn from apps like Adda/Mygate.
This app is completly non-reliable. Took my booking for house cleaning 10 days before the applied date. Took the advance. Rates are increasing (no business ethics). On the set date early morning... Got the call informed that urban company has 17 partners and any of them are not accepting the booking. If urban company is contacting the cleaning agents on the same date of set date . Why they are charging advance from me. Usless app. Irresponsible behavior. They cancelled-mentioned you.
There is no option to contact with customer care . I have made payment, it was deducted from my bank account, but not reflected at portal. But there is no option to register my complaint
No professional assigned for so long
Ridiculous service!!! You really can't trust these guys.... I had booked window glass cleaning services 4 days in prior... I had got a call today giving an excuse that they dont have any technician available and wont send anyone. I was banking on their commitment and they just shy away from thier responsibility... Never experience this before from Urban clap, they are service is deterioting... I would recommend not to go with their services...
Never rely for any service because here professionals keep cancelling it just an hour before,highly disappointed by their nature of services.Why do they give option of cancelling the service .
Terrible service. They sent 3 people, only 1 of which knew what he was doing. The other 2 were unprofessional, had to be told what to do constantly and were rude. They only had one cleaning agent for all house work, Some mystery blue liquid that they sprayed on everything. For the floor they used some chemical and landed up staining 4 of my tiles causing permanent damage. UC promised to resolve, we've heard nothing back. Was a terrible experience. NEVER AGAIN. UC outsources and has no control.
Unable to change the date. Pls call immediately
No toll free number for client to contact UC Representative üòüüòü
Very Poor
A big bunch of frauds...commit that thing only that u can provide..most unprofessional ppl...all were drunk when visited ...never go for these ppl...all 5 star reviews must be paid...we booked for platinum 3 BHK deep cleaning...but they were not ready to do anything...just a little bit of dry dusting..infact they were making the decors curtains more dirty....
Horrible...
In case you want all your appointments cancelled just 10 minutes before your appointment please download this horrible app
Don't have any knowledge of servicas
I booked 2 carpet cleaning through the app for 1400. Made the payment . When I checked openly on Google for carpet cleaning services, they are giving 2 carpet cleaning service for same size and same location for less than 400. Booked the same as a proof. When called the customer care they are just giving excuses. The company has different rates on app and when you directly search in competition with others.We feel like being cheated . Didn't expect a corporate company doing the same. Amit
Worst beauty service, my underarms skin got peeled while doing wax and as per the mentioned service time is 140mins but with 75 mins they have completed the service in very hurry. Unprofessional beauticians what they provide to customers. Pic sharing facility is there I would have shared the pic too. 2 days I suffered with burning sense. They did not even atleast refund the amount for providing worst service. Simply they said to go to dermatologist when I complaint to customer care
Worest service worest company dont belive
Didn't receive referal amount
Such a worst service I have ever seen please don't book your appointments if you are using inverter ac the technicians will take a lot of time and in the end they will say to go for new spare part and until then they will remove your complete outdoor and indoor unit and they will not be responsible for the rest of the things
good service
Very dispointing with service, last minute they cancelled my appointment, not even refund my full amount, they cut some membership charge. i am not at all interested in using this app now, then why required this types of membership.
Very poor service.. not satisfied with it.. I paid Rs 1740 for 4 bathrooms deep cleaning, I thought that service would be good but it was total waste of money... No bathrooms were cleaned properly, also in one bathroom flush tank pipe and flush tank broke down while cleaning. What's the purpose of calling for this services when you get a new damage to repair. Tiles, taps, showers, bathroom doors were not cleaned properly.. I am totally disappointed with this service
excellent service üåπ
I took the package of premium deep cleaning but the service was pathetic. The cleaners came 3hrs late. Didn't even clean anything properly and left in hurry. Their single disc scrubber also didn't work. I had to request them to dry vacuum the sofa, whereas it was included in the package. They removed toiletries from window shelf and another self and dumped in the bucket. They didn't even clean the steel shelves fitted in both bathrooms. They charged approx. Rs.5500 and it's total waste of money
Not only their staff come in late, had to leave the work in between because their machinery broke down, the customer support lady called Jasleen was rude and the cleaner managed to steal away things from my bathroom. Horrible experience. Will never recommend them
It was very bad experience in bathroom cleaning ...after their cleaning their was no difference at all ...it was the same as before....it's better to clean ourselves what I felt
Bogus
the best service I had
Worest team
good job
If i got chance to rate half star then I can even add that one. My experience with this service was so bad. Initially they book the slot and supposed to send the beutician at 2.30 pm then suddenly at 2.30 the booking was rescheduled at 7.30.the executive was describing like beutician has some personal problem. I considered n I was waiting for another beutician and at the 7.30 I got call frm this ridiculous service that beutician thing the location and in the night she wont be manage.
NO CONTROL ON SERVICE PROVIDERS. I ordered a facial service before Pujo. The service provider cancelled the booking without any intimation and later lied that she called me and I've refused. Upon calling customer care they asked me to book again but there were no slots. The company couldn't arrange a professional anytime (even beyond slot hours) for the next resulting in me not having the grooming service at all before the festival. That's how they value customers. VERY DISAPPOINTED!
rekha team did fab job. very satisfied with the the work.
I booked waxing on urban clap the service was good and all but she broke a coffee table of mine by mistake
Great service to the society.
Very bad they are not professional üò∏
Useful app
We are very happy with Hari Om, Aniket, Rinku, Lalit and Pushkar. they have done an amazing work with lot of patience. kudos to the team
Pathetic service
It is not trustable , I have scheduled for intense bathroom cleaning but none of the worker visited and after 2 hours they automatically canceled the service. What type of service is this , and no call back was done , as I complained about it, but no call received.. It is such a waste app and a disrespectful service.
ü§©
Excellent Service
Unable to book service from redeem card option getting null at last option of booking. Pathetic app or you may be intentionally does the same while i am able to book same service by paying but unable to redeem my gift card. Unable to contact any customer care and help center just getting links of guide of booking service.
Very bad over camesan
Looks like their downfall has started. Service getting pathetic
Very unprofessional service. They do not even have a customer care number to reach out to.
Wrost experience .I book hair cut but company executives call me and told me that "current booking time professional person is not available can I rescheduled the time " I said yes ofcourse that's Common problem ... Second day so many call from the company executives service and in single day min 10 call from company side and last Call is just informed me that your service request for haircut will cancle and we will refund money there was no any permission of cancle request from my side ..
must try
very trained professionals
Carpentery job was done very neatly and perfect
Professional thief
Excellent service
the best service ,uc
Worest Painting service, there covings not sufficient paint. If any chance to give less then one I can do that üòâ
Service is ok. But beautician is also ok. Very slow and not trained. She spoiled my eyebrows. Will not suggest to anyone. Overall not Satisfied.
It was really bad and disgusting first experience of Urban Company service. We booked for kitchen cleaning at 3pm and they didn't come till 6. We stay with two little kids, it is really difficult for us to vacate kitchen items again and again. They called and told me that they will come next day, their car is broke down. Really pathetic. No professionalism at all. The company should assign different staff to is, who is free at the time of my booking. Will never again take the service of Urban Co
Highly disappointed. After 3rd day of rescheduling for haircut an inexperienced hair stylist comes and does very bad hair cut. After all complaints no one responds and service very bad.
Good service
Exp is bad with the pest control service provided by one of the listed professional by UC, the person has taken entire year money for the giving service, however just came once and after that not taking my call, so completely fraud people.. and no help from UC . Very disappointed.
Worst service ever.. they grow and lose control over their services providers. Customer care agents are not understanding their role and not supportive. Sure it's a competitors timing ....!
The person not came to give the service,no response from the person taken leave from office and waiting for the service
nice work done by Rajesh Batham .quality of work n behaviour was excellent.
Pathetic. The professional came to my place for cleaning and damaged my appliances. I have been calling constantly regarding the matter and nobody has gotten back to me. Even the professional came to my house and saw the damage and he tried to escape the what ke situation by telling me that he can't contact the customer care. I will be bound to take further action if this is how you want to go about it. It's my hard earned money that is now in question. This is not how you treat a customer
Excellent service by Ranjeet
The service provider canceled the booking. The app is not even showing the booking to give feedback.
Very bad too bad service. Refund problem and very dirty and no mask
100% Recomend.. urban claps is now more perfect and upgraded in all service..
Good
Very bad booking service....after booking they will not send person to cleaning and directly cancel the booking....do not use this app....very pathetic.....
Terrible service
THIS IS THE 2ND TIME HAD MADE MY BOOKING AND THE PERSON WHO ARE ASSIGNED ARE IRRESPONSIBLE .. REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT. WORST TEAM AND SERVICE
Customer care will not respond. Worst service . If we booked appointment executives will cancel and they will tell . I won't come. Very disappointed üòû
Worst app ever. Earlier I had booked for beautician they rescheduled my appointment. Again today when I am booking for home cleaning they are asking me to reschedule it to Monday. My only question is if u dont have anyone to attend y r u showing the slots to customers. I would recommend not to depend upon this app ever
Pathetic service and pathetic standard,no punctuality,people come and damage things and company has no responsibility
Very disappointed. I have booked for friday 12:00pm, they called me exactly at 11:55 and told me no one is available and asked me to reschedule it to Sunday. I am not understanding if I am ok for Sunday, I will book for Sunday itself before right why I will book for Friday...they don't care about customer timing. I have I want today itself they said we are rescheduling it to 1 pm today, again they cancelled. Until now I was waiting and now I have to go somewhere ...Really frustrating
My experience has been great till now with Urban Company. I am extremely satisfied with their services.The employees are prompt, highly skilled and professional.Their behaviour is also very decent .The rates are quite reasonable.
lots of thnx to urban company for giving services in bihar..I wanna give u one suggestion employee should be little more skilled n professional too..
Very efficient service. Very good behaviour.
Pathetic service and customer support. I have bought there plus service and yet this is how they treat there customers. Booked for service 3 days in advance and in last hour they rescheduled it automatically( without any consultation) to next one week i. e. The service which I need NOW is almost one week DELAYED. Really bad customer experience. Guys please go for other service providers and save your money. Pathetic customer service! And to top it all They don't have customer care number!
This is a fraud app, really disgusting and absolutely pathetic experience where it's more than a week where a person visited to repair microwave oven, toom payment and dissapeared and never came back. Ruthless management, surprisingly they don't even have direct call centre number where we can connect. Tried raising issue on app, but again in vain. Brainless mortals running the show
good service
The worst experience ever...they called me before 20 min from the booked service to tell me sorry we are not able to do it.
Worst app I uninstall it becoz it does not available in my smart city Amravati üò§üò† worst app ever
Very nice comapy
Worst service
The painting service experience that i am currently having is really pathetic to say the least. They have been very unprofessional in their work. Do not pay any heed to customer experience. So far it has been a very bad experinece and would definitely think multiple times before opting for their service next time
Waste of time
Very bad experience, people didn't arrive even the booking was done three days before. Multiple follow ups required. Not atall proactive communication. Need a lot of improvement.
why extra charges for safety kit
Gifted massage therapy to my husband, he enjoyed alot. Masseur Sujit was excellent. It was as required.
Worst service and i wouldn't recommend for today's time, Please arrange manually in conventional way for your home services. They charge money instantly but they won't do immediate refund though cancelled as per their T&C Not recommended go for better alternatives
Such a bad experience. Really disappointed with the services, have booked empty kitchen cleaning 3 days prior and at the very end moment they don't have professionals to assign and when I spoke to the team they just reply with we are trying. I took my off from office and was taking the stuff out of kitchen since morning because I had booked empty kitchen cleaning and in return they surprise us with no. I mean I wasted my day because I had scheduled. Never suggesting anyone
Could not pay with cred pay even though it was listed in the offers..this is cheating
Today morning I had a booking for bathroom cleaning. I had a horrible experience with urban company. The workers didn't do their work properly. All the stains on the taps and tiles were intact after they cleaned the bathrooms. The windows and fans were left dirty and when I asked them to do it properly, they were reluctant to do it. So I would not recommend urban company services as it is a waste of your hard earned money. Don't waste your time guys just do it yourself it will be much better.
Too poor service by shivshankar hasgule
One of the worst app .thier workers abuse customers . Please don't use this app.Everyone should delete this app
Really liked the service in Ranchi, please grow this business more here.
Pathetic service!! I had booked a deep cleaning service of 2bhk flat for my parents. No doubt the guys came on time but it was like they were not in a mood to clean house. The hesistated to even pick things from the place and told my mom they wont clean 2,3 parts of the house ! I talked to the customer care of uc but the workers didn't listen to them also and stepped outsidd the house and refused to clean!! This is 2nd time i am facing this cleaning issue from UC. Never going to suggest anyone!
Great choice for any service
Horrible.. They are assigning partially vaccinated professionals... It's risky.. I have complained so many times... No action from UC.. Useless service
the best professionals and services one can avail while sitting in the comfort of your home... I just love the services and the correct methods and measures applied by the beautician... she was just perfect in all sense. thanks urban company.
no customer care. only a CJATBOT throwing u pre-fotmatted lines that u have to select. if ur issue is not one of those, u r left just like that
The worst service.. not recommend to anyone... I have tried many times on this service and each time some or the other issue... there are better alternative options are available in the market...
Usually the basic services are satisfactory. However for deep cleaning of full home, they miss out on specifics like wall cleaning. Specific lists of services included and not included are mentioned properly. However wall cleaning was mentioned in neither to confuse and ensure the booking anyway. Once services are booked, they say the service is not included in the list of available services. But if you have a list of services not included, why didn't you mention it there. Deliberate act.
Your beauticians call the customers personally and ask to give 5 star ratings forcefully and ask customers to book them personally, without involving you. You must pay them properly.
Highly Unprofessional. First booking they didn‚Äôt show up.. Second time on their repeated request to give them another chance, we booked again and again they did not honour their commitment. Not recommend at all as they do not respect their commitment and the clients time!
App is not working properly
Excellent and safe service during Covid 19 period.Nice experience.
Very bad service
They cancelled on last moment and have taken the payment in advance. Now you cannot do anything because they do not have contact details as well. The most pathetic app that cannot be trusted. Never take services from such pathetic fools who charge you even for gloves but have no service to suppprt the prices.
Cleaning and carpentry very good experience
Very bad and poor service in Varanasi.Never try for any service
Despite making my advance payment, their professionals are repeatedly denying my service, it has been 2 to 3 days, giving time after Diwali to service, which shows their very poor service. And the company is also not doing anything about it, it is supporting its professional only. Worst services ü§¨
Really upset there is no way to approach customer care as well as charging for the material is high , installing one thing charging for higher quality material
Pest control was done for removal of cocroch but it was done to no effect.
No single service is available in coimbatore nowadays
Very poor experience for bathroom cleaning services
Poor app. Always updating n not user friendly. No contact number, no email given for help center. Very poorly made.
Very poor service.
Good experience
I haven't seen such an unprofessional company ever. You're charging such a hefty amount for each and every service but your professionals are working on their own will. Its not urban company, it's unprofessional company good bye
At first all the services were nice but later on in one of the cleaning services the professional broke my sink and when I tried contacting the company there was no reply from their side not able to call them helpline not working worst management
excellent approach, service, attitude
Great
Today we hired for deep cleaning of the house but it was pathetic to the core.Things were stolen and no cleaning done as shown in the video.plz be aware
Good work
very disappointed
Satisfactory
First time i faced very bad experience. Booked facial and bleach but not at all satisfied with it i spend 1447 rs on it i didnt get any result. Highly disappointed. I will not recommend any one to take your service. Waste of money.
Very good concept, service and value add
I booked UC services for kitchen clean. My entire gas stove surface and sink, both stenless steel surfaces are fully damanged by the chemical used for cleaning. I have been sending complaints since 5 days via the app, but there is no solution provided yet.
Why aren't there Classic salon services at ulwe. Prime is too expensive. And there are so many other companies with same offers. Get classic services at ulwe it wud be great.
Nice!^_^
Worst app. Tried for booking for simple hair cut always asking for annually packages, I don't have spare time to waist here . Booking time to be instant . I can go to barber shop . Sorry guys
Taken the service of toilet cleaning, Hige disappointed, worse service ever, I have recievd from Uc. The professional did not clean anything did not use mashine for intense cleaning, Left the job in between and told he is getting late, Not even clear the dust from mirror. Did sanitise himself and didnt wear the mask aswell, I need some other professional to complete the service or require refund of it,
Excellent service
The person explained the things very politely and did a great work we are extremely happy with his work
Worst service.Booked pest control for home.Job not completed even after chasing many times.Suggest to call Local vendors, atleast they finish their job.
sumedh and team doing very good work
Bad service , their house painting service is worst
Good Service provided for the amount fixed for each service
nice work.very gentle.
I'm trying to make some payments on the app, and it is showing some offers for different methods. Problem is that I don't see all those options.. When I'm booking a service, some payment options are shown.. Some other options when I'm trying to pay the final bill. The app has to be consistent. The service by partners are mostly very good, just that sometimes they get delayed while reaching the place.
Worst expirience of painting ever. Useless company. A bigggg fraudster
Pathetic
For god's sake of you have to cancel an appointment, cancel it before when a person can make other arrangements. Not after the required time. We are not donkeys sitting here.
cost is high
Excellent
Worst UI ..no way to see basket of services...no way to reorder
very professional, polite and cooperative
Unnecessary charges are added
amazing

Plzz guys don't go for urban company..paint department...there is a big scam going on...cheating people and taking money upfront...don't fall for this...I am suffering ..I don't want any one else to suffer..
Excellent
I got immediate support from cc best service ‚ù§Ô∏è
Very good
I have been trying to reach out for one of the bookings that I have had in the recent past. The booking was in regards to RO service where in the parts they changed for us didn't improve the quality and service but instead the other things stopped functioning. These guys only looted and aren't ready to answer our calls now. Urban clab needs to have a better channel where in we can reach out to them through Help Center Chat.
Timly and quality service.
They don't even call back after taking the money
Have been faced with utter rubbish of paying for the membership even when I do not want to subscribe for it. The customer support does not understand the matter and the app automatically selects the membership when you place an order and make fool out of the users. There is no professionalism in the support team to escalate the issue and resolve it. I would recommend not to use urban company ever.
Good
Prompt and good service.
Good
services can be provided bit lesser prices, please work on it
The way UC treats its customers, is highly appreciable.
Good
very helpful at times of need
If option of negative rating is there I would have been happy to give that to urban company.horrible experience of getting my home painted by them.no coordination with their vendors.they strongly believe in harrassing their customers.
Service very bad/no experience for provide information
provide customer care number for talking and clarification
haircut cost is too high
Excellent.
I have used UC for salon services. And so far it is really good
We are being charged extra for safety service but I noticed Neha is reusing sheets caps etc. No sanitisation of tools before using. Little risky
good service nice experience
verygood
Seems they just rip money for service. I opted for geyser repair, it required coil change. They insist on buying it themselves and don't provide any bill/show us the MRP we need to blindly pay amount what they say. Totally unacceptable. Never going to use this app again
very good
Eww tHis is the worstest app my washing mashine was i a bit good condition before they re-pair and now it is got burned
U guys r highly unprofessional, kitchen was not being cleaned at all. Har jagha kuch na kuch chod diya, now u r not answering calls also, it's disgusting , unprofessional, n intolerable.....
service is good but prices are high according to a small work... even material is our's ...
I booked for TV repair, which was promised to be fixed in 24 hrs, but after 4 days , with 100 follow ups and listening to lame excuses from professional, the tv was returned as it is. I don't think UC respects customer time and service seriously. All that glitters is not gold ,stands true for them.
The worst app to book anything. Shows a lot of options to make payments but hardly ever works. The app is so freaking slow you can start cleaning yourself and finish and still you won't be able to book a service from this slow as snail app. If only you could spend money improving your app and not paying Ayushman Khurana maybe you would have more customers.
Great boon in current times!
Worst
Service provided is always incomplete or not worthy. Have faced some instances where the service guy damaged my property but urban company is providing no refund or support.
My first experience with UC was excellent.
This is a cheat company they send completely unprofessional people Not only that they have created a system where it is extremely difficult for a customer to reach them. Guyz think twice before installing this app
Big scam!
Defective app. Can't add my profile. Can't place order. App times out fast. Keeps putting off the message "Something went wrong. Try again". Sorry, I'm uninstalling the app.
Bad experience with Carpenter, Don't take risks by giving big carpentry work through UC. It's good for small work, for big work they charge you more, incomplete work, won't clean the mess they create. UC has ridiculous warranty as these guys complete the work after the warranty expires.
I think they don't value customer time it's been many times they keep give excuses to reach on time
M unable to book. No customer service I want to book a full home cleaning.
Excellent app and services!!!!
Very very bad experience. Unprofessional to core.... no direct number to call and the professional they send are useless. I have written back to the mail id provided. If there is a suitable action I will change my ratings
Worst customer service and unable to use the refer code
good and dedicated work
Good
No customer care support and no cobtact info available to reach them for poor services
They charge 4x for services that you really need. The "basic" packages they offer do not cover anything. Don't be a fool and order services from around you, instead of looking for "professionals."
Superb, On time expert solution at reasonable price......
Executives cancel the service on last minute and there is not way to contact the company as well. Poor experience
They have a policy where if the cx cancels less than 2hrs the penalty is 50 Rs. I completely agree with that. However, if they reschulde an appointment without talking to the cx it means that they are taking the cx for granted. There is no penalty that the company pays towards the cx. You can't reschedule the appointment 2 mins before and schedule it an entire hour later without bothering to call the cx and ask for conseny. If slots on your app is just for the heck of it then do away with it.
THEY ARE THE WORST. PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM EVERY IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY. IHAD TO GIVE 1 STAR AS APP DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO SUBMIT REVIEW WITHOUT A STAR
Very good job,covered the entire area,clean and neat
Just joined & take benifited from there.
its excellent
Bad experiance with 2 service. Will not consider in future.
Very professional staff
Terribke service. Highly unprofessional. I don't recommend at all.
Good job
Very unprofessional company, I booked my deep house cleaning . No one come for cleaning , and there is no intimation from company and after requesting for call , there call centre executive told aapko kaam karwana ho too karwao hame koi farak nahi padta ,and worst thing we cannot contact them . Paisa bhi do aur nakhre bhi duniya bhar ke.
Super
‡§®‡•ã
urban clap service is not that much good.
Good
There is no way to contact these people, they schedule visits but no one shows up neither picks up the call
Great app. The professionals are punctual and really good at their specific jobs.
great service
Used Urban company platform for servicing and repairing of our 1.5 ton split AC. Their technician was good and did a thorough and professional job. They are a bit on the expensive side but prompt and good..
Really poor experience with urban company, all over paint strains are left on my furnitures. No proper customer support
good
Dnt fall for their ads. They make tall claims. Their service is just 50% of what they claim.
Good
Very nice
Good job
the service has been very good.
Nice Experience
The service was very good and professional cleaners. They did all the services meticulously and also helped in rearranging the household items back. I would highly recommend their services. Thank you Urban Clap.
Good experience Brajesh Dheeraj n Neeraj did their job perfectly
The UC Rewards cannot be used. It's trash and there is no support provided by Urban Company. So, I would not recommend this app.
Booked for services. But every time the professional cancelled the booking from their side by themselves, 1sy someone died and then some hospital issue. 2 issues on same day and then they charged cancellation charges Moreover they dnt even have courtesy to tell in advance. I come to know when I called to check about the arrival in spite of not reaching on time
Very good UC
Good
Best of luck in getting your work done. Professionals.do not turn up and the customer service keeps on rescheduling.
Worst customer care team. I booked painting service, bad experience. No one is bothered after taking advance
good service
Prompt and courteous service.
Non professional behavior. Waste of time.
Terrible. Professionals never arrived. Bad job
best
good
This is about the service they tell us we can choose the one we want to get the service for and in a row for a week they kept assigning someone else even after fixing the appointments on call they would change the person assigned last minute . Horrible service,u clearly lost a client and many more coz I am spreading the word
I had booked full apartment deep cleaning service with Urban. The service provided was awful. The cleaning staff did not have proper equipment to clean the house. Urban company is very unprofessional. There is no customer care number. They do not reply to email or online complaint. .... It's fraud... Do not get trapped, their services are horrible.
Unable to provide professionals and makes you wait for next 1 hr before resolve anything and hence the person is left with no options.
Very poor service
nice service
Very nice experience first time it removed all the dust from the sofa
super easy to book and satisfying services. hassle free and very comforting, way better than going to salon.
Fantastivc
Excellent job!!
after reading the reviwes of people i will never use this app
Service not good I hate this app
Very poor. They cancel the pre-paid booking without any intimation. Extremely poor. Most unfortunate part being they don't even have a courtesy to call or a dedicated call centre wherein you can approach with grievances. My membership fee gone for waste!!! Pathetic!!!
My experience was excellent. Would again take the service.
Very professional service for chimney cleaning by Mr. Ajay Rawal (Bengaluru)
I've had the worst experience ever. They kept on delaying my booking for 2 days, and on the 2nd day also they didn't send the professional.
This rating is not for the app but the Service which is below par and even the membership plan is a idea to make money by UC. Hope they improve on the way they do business and make one feel cheated.
Nice
It's worth the money. They took time to clean each and every corner and did a good job
Worst service...not recomended
Nyc
Worst experience Non helping staff Useless people No commitment to work at all Pathetic association Waste of money time and energy
My experience with this company is very bad.The appointmented professional didn't come and when I contact him he refused to come. I call the customer care center they were very rude.my money was not also refunded
Highly unprofessional and unreliable.Booked empty kitchen cleaning at 1:30 pm. But no professional was assigned to the task until 2:00 pm. I got a call at 2:30 saying I ll have to reschedule as they do not have free hands for next three days. Very bad experience.
work done nicely
perfect work
I had very bad experience with seema cleaning company sent to us by urban company. They were shabby, left many places unclean. They broke my geyser pipe for which I had pay my plumber. They refunded 600 rs, but the geyser still not working. They said they have cleant the top of cupboards and tubelights, but it was a lie. Next day we found it was as dirty as ever. They left bathroom with dirty floor and bucket with black stains, all which was clean before they came. Very unhappy service
Not bad
useful to every one
I have booked the slot and did advance payment. But since all the beauticians were busy they couldn't assign any beautician to the preferred time slot and when I cancelled the booking after that particular time slot is over, I have been charged the cancellation fees and amount has not been credited back. This was very disappointing.
Worst experience
Pathetic services....they didn't cleaned properly...they were making excuses instead of trying...you guys just fool people......tiles are still dirty and they didn't even clean the rest room and exhaust fan properly....i need my money back!!!!
Wonderful service by the technician
A message in the morning confirming who is coming for the service would really help
Just awesome and superb. Cost effective.
Menaka's service is par excellence
Urban clap please gave me your no immediately
My first experience with UC with horrible because they told me your whitewash work will be complete in 5 days but it is not completed in 15 days, and they damaged my bulb holder, they didn't cover my house ware, professional team not come regularly on site, not finishing on the wall after whitewash, I have many calls about this matter but my problem not solved. they didn't clean the my furniture and floor after whitewash, labour of Urban Company told me its not my work.
Excellent
I booked cleaning services from them and they cancelled last minute also they called me very late and said they will arrange someone but even after waiting for 1 and half hour they did not revert back..There is no way to reach out to them via phone or chat and even after promising they did not reach out to me
Really disappointed with the services. Scheduled a home cleaning service but they cancelled it on the last moment on the pretext that professionals were not available when I had already pre-booked 4 days prior. It was really unprofessional from their side and they failed to deliver their promise. If they were not able to confirm the booking they should have atleast informed it beforehand. Will definitely not recommend it to anyone.
Exceptional
Pathetic service. They have rude, unprofessional and untrained vendors.
Very painful experience. All I wanted to tell them that I want a lady professional for haircut instead of male for my mother. But there is no such option. No call center and poor ux
Pathetic experience. The professional did not arrive niether cancelled the booking. The customer service was worse, she told me she would book another professional but later said all slots were booked.When asked to speak to a supervisor she effortlessly disconnected the call. Horrible services
for any query pl advertise ur contact no. some queries could be different from inbuilt generic questions
Very Expensive
After your professional cleaned the sofa The sofa is stinking with bad smell Even after 8th day of raising tickets on this issue my problem is not solved
thank you
They don't assign professional on time and even after the scheduled time is passed, they never call back. No support. Advance payment is taken by them which was never refunded. Poor services and customer experience. No compensation. Totally a tinewaste.
Bad experience . I had booked for full house deep cleaning but 1 hr before they are unable to find a professional due to peak season,if that's the case why do you accept booking ,would have given 0 stars if possible
Gud coustomer support
She is so good
Pathetic services, huge decline in quality and commitment. No professional behavior
Over all good service. They should introduce cart option in their app.
Pathetic and very expensive staff also not good
excellent
Worst experience with salon service. The beautician was a fraud.she stated that her kid is alone at home and if she could come tomorrow and give rest service but she never came back nor responded my calls. I paid her entire cash on trust. But when I tried UC for customer support there is no proper channel
I booked a electrician, amount of Rs. 499 debited from my account , company says they have not received the payment, after persistent complaints they say , i will get the refund , but till date nothing. Their app , i cannot even see my complaint even booked. Very strange. If any other person has any similar issues , ike no service , amount nit refund ,pls contact me , we all will take up this matter together.
People are getting Services but what they pay ,around 50% earning is of Urban Company . The Service Technicians are all outsourced from open market , why don't people trust the people around you and pay them 100%.... What they deserve. Why we always go through intermediators.
Too good
Great app. Great service. Easy to use and hassle free.
Not satisfied with the service........... cleaning was not done properly.. .
Very bad service
Do not belive on the videos and words. Wrong promises
I scheduled cleaning for 9 bathrooms altogether at 8 A.M., the professional messages me at 9:34 A.M. that plz madam reschedule it. There were no slots for rescheduling. I have already made my slot for these 9 bathroom cleaning, when i asked for refund,they deducted significant amount too. That is really bad.you should not hire this type non- punctual irregular of professionals.
Had a very disappointing experience with urban company...booked empty ampartment cleaning but even after 4 days they could not assign anyone for the job...very poor service.
the worst experince dealing with this company back office ...really bad
This app having solutions of some undefined problems, system is organised in this app
I booked one carpenter.First of all he told that he could come late by two hours.I told him that I had my own appointment and have to go back.He agreed. But after waiting for three hours approx he didn't appear at the site. It costed me nearly Rs six hundred as rent and a whole day of frustration.I had to cancel other appointments too. Overall it was a horrible experience with UC.
The barber was coughing all the time...üëé
Poor behaviour of technicians and incorrect pricing charged. Not recommended at all
Very professional staff and they always be on time.
good service
It is amazing app and services are quitely good
Goodüëè
Worst experience.Highly unprofessional. Assigned person neither communicated or informed for being late ..nor has arrived yet.
Worst cleaner experience , toooo slowww left home uncleaned. Use fones during the service alot
Service is not like before, professionals are always changing. The good professionals which were assigned to me before they are not available. I don't want to leave selecting professionals to UC because might be not good professionals
Very polite agent's
Trained professionals for there respective work
I am "liking" UrbanCompany. UX is increasing for every booking. I could get the people to solve repairs and works very easily. Request you to add more services like interior design, laptop repair etc
Very bad experience the painting service is absolutely bad of urban company no proper planning and no proper scheduling . Worst service will never recommend any one to try Urban Company Painting service My issue is still not resolved I was told that I will receive the refund imidiately once the material is picked up but still I have not received it . None of the team members have contacted me to provide the information about the refund
Best performance & experience
Extremely good service.. very friendly, nd gave me enough time when I said that it's my 1st time waxing..##Thanks Nazain##Thanks UC
They take the booking but during the assigned time of the service selected, they call up and cancel the appointment. This has been happening past a month continuously. They expect you to cancel all your other work for them and don't provide the service. I don't understand why a time slot booking is taken if the worker is going to be unavailable at the given time. When we call them up, they just keep apolozing and don't provide the service. This has ended up wasting a lot of my time.
I have never seen such poor service.
Good
Hate the customer service by UrbanClap. They'd never connect to you for complaints. After service is too bad. My experience for all the the 3 times have been so bad. And having no reply on it from the company makes me want to come out here and comment this.
pathetic Service by urban company. Professional assigned denied Service at the last Moment and cancelled the Scheduled Service. To add to the agony Urban company claims the opposite. As UC grows it seems UC has forgotten to Act for customer satisfaction. Height is that UC sends message that the professional has indicated that I dont require service. Lies lies and lies. if this continues, will have to find an alternate. extremely disappointed.
Nice app
If any thing goes wrong by their technitian, they don't come up with any help. You are left with loss of your equipment.
Had a very bad experience with painting wherein the things were not planned properly. The execution was also not good as was committed basics of covering items was not fulfilled. Material ordered in appropriately I have excess items lying with me worth Rs 6000. I had to spend Rs 6000 additional for deep cleaning. Should take competitive quotes from market.
unnecessary questions are being questioned by the app,it's taking lot of time to close the service. services are damaged gd ,but while rating the professional so many questions, whyyyyyyg?????????????????????‚ÄΩ??????????
We asked for deep intense cleaning of the bathrooms , n let me say ur bloody idiot of a professional did such an abysmal job of it that we were better off widout getting it done . We paid for the job widout getting ANY value for it . We asked for a revisit but the result was the same . This guy's reluctance to do his job was to be seen to be believed . PATHETIC COMPANY WID PATHETIC EMPLOYEES .
affordable service. highly professional
ok
Very good app
Extremely unprofessional and advertisment is all lies and misleading, thier worker when talked to me said they don't have any equipments. First they themselves reschedule the appointment and then thier worker cancel the appointment .. waste my time and disturb me .. atleast they should refund my full payment as they cancelled it twice .. so reduction shouldnot be thier and no customer care number for head centre provided, even before wasn't giving any customer care number .
very good service
Excellent
overall service of kitchen cleaning was good and satisfied
good
Very good
Good and convenient services.
Tried it for first time. The professional simply denied to come. Asked me to cancel half an hour prior to scheduled booking. Then another professional was assigned for evening. He too didn't come and didn't even informed. Kept calling but no answer. Was asked to reschedule for next morning. Did that too. Still no response from professional / customer care. Didn't come for work. Wouldn't suggest anyone to go for their services. Horrific experience. Uninstalling after getting my payment back.
No way to directly buy the subscription. Only on order booking. That too is not showing for me anymore.
Ok good
perfect
The app doesn't allow you to buy a subscription/membership. Only when you book a service it asks if you want to add a subscription, so I tried that. However when the payment got through, the membership wasnt applied and the app charged 100% of the service. Call centre was busy, and no way to contact the help centre regarding this issue. Also could not find something as basic as haircuts for women on their services. Really disappointing experience.
Giving one star so that customer care contact me in order to understand our pain.. Home cleaning has not been started yet at scheduled time and no response from customer care
ok good
Have been a long time member of UC. Have utilised their services plenty of times. A little pricey but totally worth the experience. Thank you.
good
Good service
Worst no customer direct customer support no what so ever update
service was excellent..üëç
Easy and convenient to book and to complete payment .The UC app is my go to app for all handy jobs around the house .I just recently started using the salon services as well and have been super impressed with the quality and standards.
Professionals are forcing customers to spend money on the product or tools doesn't required... And made running thing worse....
For nails they bring bad quality nail polish and not nice colors however the ladies are very professional and nice.
Very bad experience. . Not gonna refer anyone to book from urban company. Poor and pathetic service.
good service
Pathetic service, person came for sofa cleaning, couldn't remove stains with water+soap solution he bought, after showing how stain "disappear" with 3M foam, he ran off (as it involved effort to clean using the foam) -- he was only interesting in superficial cleaning using his own pathetic product.
Good
Worst experience ever.They don't have professional and still they shows the services....and ask for rescheduling at the last moment.
Booking the appointment is a nightmare. App keeps forcing me to confirm the adress. As a result I have the same address created 4 times. And the cleaning fellow comes for kitchen deep cleaning. I have house painting getting over. Wanted the kitchen cleaned. He runs away saying he can't do it. So my appointment has been cancelled twice over ???? Very very bad experience . When we book for cleaning, it's obvious the place is dirty. If it wasn't dirty I wouldn't need someone to do the needful ????
all in one, extremely helpful
Pathetic service
Super pathetic service. First time booked the slot for cleaning and goofed up in that too. Dear Urban Company, before booking any slot for your customers, have a courtesy to ask whether it is convenient to them or not. Do not book any slot your own it doesn't work. You need to learn few basic attiquets before running this service. Even I have paid for the chrges as well but they are neither cooperating in refund nor for the due service. First experience is very poor.you deserve zero rating.
Horrible service
This was my first order with Urban Company. Punctual, very professional. Thoroughly recommended.
Very very bad Just a visit done nothing took otp and charged 450 rupees Please be careful with them. And they always lie and the persons in the help center are worse than the technicians.
All the professional are not up to mark, some of them are very rude, It's not just first time have faced the problem several time, never on time
Despite of multiple reminders from my side and repeated assurance from the urban company, they are still unable to assign and send a person for service. They simply can't understand how one can live in a home with empty kitchen for few days...no value for time..no value for money...really a nightmare. Please refund my money back as i don't want to give even a single penny for such a worst service platform.
Pathetic....is the best description. The professional was 2 hours late and that too he came forcefully as he would have to pay the penalty to the company if he didn't. He was asking me to reschedule the cleaning as he was stuck somewhere but the customer care called me n said that he will do it today. Cleaning was not upto the mark, we clean the bathrooms more cleaner...he didn't use any machine. I had requested deep cleaning but there was nothing as such.It was normal cleaning.Very disappointin
Very disappointed.....i booked a serive for diwali cleaning and they didnt assign the professional till the last moment and forced me to cancel the services.....never recommend such fool people
I am very unhappy with the service, we have booked the urban clap service they are professionals,but after booking they send local unprofessional people for work. What they show in the videos are fake
Efficient and prompt service. AC installation got done on 2nd July 21. Didn't use it for a couple of months but now I find that water leaking. Issue with installation. Warranty expired even though it is not my fault. UC should send the same technician to rectify it. No way to raise the issue.
Work with patience and listens to the requirement very calmly. Satisfied with the work. Nice experience
Local guys with branded company makes thus company No never going ti use their services
Not working properly
Its a fradulent company. Any service you book and the Technician will give an estimate that is always higher than that is mentioned on the app. If you decide not to take the service, you need to give 100/- to the technician. 60/- for fuel and 40/- for Covid sanitization. And UC also deducts 30/- as cancellation charge. They send local thugs and totally unprofessional people to your home whose first line is - "Sir, UC ka booking cancel karo, main direct cash me kaam karke deta hoon"
Their chef service is a fraud. There are no "chefs" - they just gathered a bunch of folks who can watch YouTube videos and cook. Horrible service and very disappointing customer support leaving you very frustrated. Do yourself a favor and avoid the heartburn and risk some really bad food.
good
I am trying to book my services for home last 2 months but in my location not available any services
I have booked the service on 13th Oct 2021. Horrible waxing experience due to poor quality product. I had to consult the dermatologist the very next day and till today Peeling of skins and rashes are there. The company executives called me and promised to refund for the facial which I did not avail post such experience but the refund has also not come.
Prices are very high and after sales services are not good
Their services are good, even the team is good. My only grouse is not a single customer care number is listed on their website. It was a big challenge for me to search their contact. Finally I mailed them. I got a response and my issue was resolved though. But i would like to bring it to their notice that their out of india cus care contact numbers are very well listed then why not indian customer care number??? They are present in so many cities in India but not a single number to contact.
Called for my parents house cleaning. Simple cleaning done with damage to gas pipeline making a life threatening situation. I won't recommend this company for anything
It's worth
Please keep the review pending
good service
Pathetic they don't even bother about ur appointments just cancel or reschedule as they wish
Excellent
Job was good. But he did not complete and went off. All dust i had ti remove. Not appropriate
We had booked for diwali cleaning our house, 5 people came from the company and their worknwas very bad.. We paid 10k for such disgusting cleaning... even after the cleaning there are places they did not clean properly . Very disappointed.
Very bed service
Customer help service is pathetic. No way to contact them directly if there is an urgent issue and customer care won't call back within dedicated time.
The person who was assigned for my home disinfection services did really well. He took his time and did all the work very properly. Thank you. Mr. Peirpasha shaikh
The worst ever ... I booked cleaners at 5.30 ..they called me to come earlier and rescheduled my appointments but at the end the cleaners didn't show up at all instead they lied to me how low! They told me they are at the reception and when I came down there was nobody !! What a Shame!
Poor service
The company services are pathetic no reply either from customer care nor from assigned proffesional. Tv mechanic arrived and took our 42 inches samsung tv for repair and it's been 1 month niether he responds to the calls nor the company.worst services.i suggest not to avail any of their services
No reponse from company
Manoj is extremely professional and very involved in the job. He takes all the necessary steps to ensure work goes smoothly and customer is happy.
price of service are few high but service is good
cleaning with bare foot,as no rubber boots was provided. I could see the damage on their foot. pls do care for your partner's health.
Very good.
I have booked painting work and due to price cost cancelled. Cancellation amount was not refunded and followed up on multiple times. Transactions should be Clear with customers to trust
Urban co. Services was our first experience and the worst ever. Is this the way your company is earning good rating? Begging for rating, if not given 5 rating then they are refunding the amount of the customers, High charges than local vendors and there is no transparency... Please share this strong feedback to everyone so that they dont repeat the same mistake. I have deleted the Urban clap app from my mobile. Seriously dont want to comment further.
I was very disappointed by UC. We ordered the part time helpers and received a confirmation. We had a big family gathering on the following day. We had to stay up till 4 AM to do all the stuff by ourselves. We didnt even receive a notice that the helpers are not coming we tried contacting the number but with no luck later a lady answered and told me that her shift ended and she dont know what I'm talking about we tried the message service on the app, no response. Very bad experience, never again
various services are useful and good, handy for people who doesn't want to venture out... the services are also reasonably priced..
Booked for plumber yesterday (24th oct), no one called me and no response from allocated plumber. This is too worst. Loosing good will on the urban company.
10/10
Excellent
Overall good experience and good service
Freeze cooling issue resurfaced immediately after expiry of service warranty. Again booked service and the technician confirms that earlier service was completed with wrong parts hence the problem and same parts needs to replaced again. Urban company rejected my complain by saying that we cannot accept the technicians assessment.
No coupon works
I had booked for personal Chef for a month paying premium charges. Chef didn't turnout till now and my money is not getting refunded apart from rescheduling the chef time twice. There is no customer care number to get in touch for support. Worst app and a fraud company. If not able to provide service return my money. Word of caution, Don't be a prey to the Chef services.
Good good very good
should start with male services of mani n pedi n prices should be in a limit its bit on a higher side
Charged extra money
Very hard to connect with urban company customer care. Very bad services
I have raised several tickets related to texture finish at my house but no response, every time different person will call and then no action
booked facial service at 1200+. product userd were not O3 brands. misleading adverts at best.
UC are doing finanacial frauds please do check before booking yesterday I booked a fully prepaid Beautician service for my wife..after the service the professional asked Rs150 more stating techincal glitch....When I called customer care they told me to clear the amount to professional and I will get the amount back....but Today they denied.....I hope this experience is useful to somebody don't pay any excess amount......They show one and they charge another ask for cash.....
Very Bad experience. Don't go for Urban company.
Very bad experience as I have booked for premium house cleaning and taken slot for 1.30 pm and upto 6 o'clock evening, no one has came to give service. No value of time commitment.
My parents (senior citizens) have been trying to get some house work done for Diwali but have had the worst experience through this app. After repeated appointments & calls, their people still didn't show up. Then they stopped answering our calls. Horrible horrible experience. Never using this again.
Excellent Service @ Excellent Prices
Extremely Unprofessional!!
Gud
Lovely Experience. Thank U UC...
The company should insist the service personnel to follow all Covid norms and be neat and clean.
Not bad
Fine
Very bad service in my life
Dont trust this app...the professional they talk about r not all professional...plus stolen the things from house...please beware...before booking...bad experience... Specially ARP cleaning service...if they give you that cleaners then dont trust...hope my message is read by all...
good
Great experience. Professional care was taken
Urban Company is a one stop solution but unfortunately it doesn't service my area (Howrah) why can't there be an active customer care number . Please help
Excellant , prompt service
Good
Best service...Great jobüëç
Booking cancelled on the day of service, while I booked it 2 days before. The company does not offer any compensation for the inconvenience caused to the customer on the contrary urban clap charge customer for rescheduling and cancellation. Highly disappointed with the service.
gud service
Rates and Charges are very high, better service and cheaper rates are available in competitor apps and in local market. Looting customer with expensive spare parts and extremely high labour charges.
excellent service
Service was okay.. But charges are not proportional to work.. Market vendors are quite cheap then your service providers. My first experience and not pleasant one.
Please most unprofessional app, they will confirmed the booking, and then they will call to cancel last minute when professional is not available, and this has happened thrice, don't trust their CONFIRMED BOOKINGS
extremely good with all the services.
Urban company has the best quality service I have ever experienced.They have qualified professionals...
AC uninstall and install 2000. Remaining charges 5000 and they will say it's mandatory otherwise AC compressor issues will not work.Fruad completely. Total AC shifting 7500. Idiots, we don't the background so we need to listen. Definately I will take this issue to next level by adding all bills, records. If we don't know these people will steal our money easily.90% people like this only. Someone should be there to monitor everything. Worst worst worst.
Excellent, perfect service
good job
Worse experience, I booked my first service but did not get the service due to unavailability of the cleaners "thats what they're saying". They took the money upfront and after rescheduling for 3 times, still no luck. Worse company ever.
Rates are too costly
More than 75% of them are better in various ways than a non UC mechanic. UC should provide more equipment like ladders if needed. Cost can be adjusted. Ladders may help in safety n work quality.
Too pricey. Not satisfied. No helpline number to call on to. Raised complaints waiting customer care response. Beautician was not good.
Vry bad service
good app
Very bad service i booked them for deep cleaning but at last moment they Cancelled.
some of their services r excellent. But now they started using the pandemic as a money making opportunity. I booked a carpenter and other than the charges for the service, they also charged visitation charge. If I am already paying for his service why a visitation charge? And how long they charge 50 rupees In d name of ppe kit which no on wears. Even after service is done, feedback from UC asks if mask was worn or not. If you are charging for ppe, why no question about it?!
excellent
Pathetic service and very low grade Executives, I spoke to Deepanshu and he is really very rude and not at all helpful. He needs to be send to trainings again. I will be escalating to the CEO of Urban Company.
Too costly for service
You can't expect professionalism from these people. They do not visit on time nor bother to inform you about the delay.
Beware before you book house painting and after the work done if any issue surfaces. The quality of paint isn't good . Scratches pop up so easily, color peel off if little moisture. I did with local contractors years ago and the paint lasted for years without any issue. But with UC paint will not last long even you use Asian paints. Not did in my case .I don't know why. Very expensive. Estimation was higher then what we got. No refund was done. They lie about holding money till paint is done.
Can be better. So many options are not available. So many models are nkt availble.
I am very much disappointed with AC service they are giving warranty for 3 months for gas filling and same gas leakage issue has occurred within 6 months
They don't work on time...worst service for cleaning...booked 4 days back still not scheduled and they reschedule it according to them. It's a very bad experience as I booked it and nothing has been done no response you guys run a very big company and still can not arrange people to do work.
I hv booked my bookings with this company twice. The first service was okay but I m disappointed with the second that is with the house painting consultancy. First of all the app should have a proper information along with the rate map for what you guys are charging. In the home painting consultancy only Rs.99 is written so u guys should be specific for what u r taking this amount. The consultant came and just charged 99 and this is not fair. Really disappointed with this.
I would say Urban Clap is revolutionary. During the time when people keep looking in for quality professionals who can do the repair/service job for their home, UC made life easy. Everything about them are positives, right from Quality of work, the amazing UI app and great customer service. I have been using it for over 2 years and I really love it. Way to go Urban clap! üíê
Always go with Urban clap and not with any small vendor, they take ownership and complete any work left incomplete identified later by sending over their rep. Therefore, don't go with small vendors for cleaning. Urban charges are nominal compared to the service they provide
Bad service. They give us warranty period but don't call back until that warranty period ends.
Bad pathetic and highly disappointing customer service.. bad management
Good
Service was too good
Highly disappointed. My chimney cleaning services was 3 times rescheduled as professional didn't turn up for various reasons. The customer care assures that they will personally make sure our service satisfaction. But all the promise were hollow I suppose. UC cannot be relied for any Diwali home cleaning at all.
From my experience, Incompetent, rude and unqualified professionals are appointed. It was 4 times I had to reschedule the booking owing to the poor services of the company. One time the professional himself cancelled the booking while we were anticipating his arrival. Over and above upon cancellation, Rs.100 was charged alleging it to be non refundable subscription charges. Utterly outrageous. Never ever going to avail the services again.
They are professional cheaters. They will try hard to replace spare parts even if the part is not damaged and charge you high amount. Customer care is worse.
UC offers very professional services. Value for money and much like international services
Good
Very bad service the professionals are never on time
You guys advertise deep cleaning best bathroom cleaning service and your professional refuses to deliver service saying bathroom size is bigger I will not do it Amazing service
Excellent service and was able to manage my flat cleaning remotely.very professional and responsive employees. Keep it up
Pathetic app, they will take the booking showing you the available slots and sit on it until you follow up on it. At the end, "apologies for the inconvenience, can we reschedule" and that too when you follow up.
Good
Urban clap has been utter unprofesstional. I booked the service for 23Oct and the professional never arrived. It got rescheduled for Sunday 24 Oct however story remained the same. Finally the 3 case manager assured me to get it done on 25th Oct (similar to last 2 case managers she also promised it will be done), however today it automatically got rescheduled for 28th Oct. This is done without talking to me. My 3 days leaves are wasted for their incompetence to provide
Good
Company mentioned too much fake information about their services My own experience is very bad. They hired untrained professional. Company doesn't value ur time and money, nor they provide tool kits or machines to their professional for services..
Excellent work
Would like to see more services like gas repairy, fabrication work etc .you are doig fab job otherwise !
good service
Trained professionals
Professional dint turn up for the service and no information was given to me from professional and urban company
wrost aap
Great service, used proper machines, tools and utilities to carry out the work...liked the Professionalism
All the things that glitter is not gold with the same way all the commitments and talks urban company does are not true ....I opted for painting services frm them last month...it started horrible only..there so called trained painters or professionals broke my bed while cleaning or maybe while shifting it ....after that everyday followup with them nd ends with compensation of just 2000 rs...that also after so many talks. After a month of painting my kitchens utility paint starts peeling off.
Very bad experience. My booking was scheduled but nobody came and did not even bother to call. Cannot recommend it to anyone
Good app for quick resolution. One stop solution
good
I had opted for waxing and threading. My money got deducted from my account but the appointment was showing unsuccessful. Scamster app this is.. their app doesn't work and I can't access anything after the address thing after my failed.. chutiya app this is..
Always being with excellent experience
It's nice
I try it for d first time and the experience was great
There is no proper customer care support before booking the service.
Gog
Very good work by K. Jagadeesan. Patiently cleaned all surfaces. Asking for comments immediately after each job. 8 hours of non stop work with smiling face till the completion. Highly Satisfied with his services.
Excellent
Enjoyed the service at home
Great services
Need painters. Urgently
Great service and on time. only missing part is number to connect with them
Very bad no response , services not in time
It was so so so much super
Classic salon quality not up to the mark..
excellent job done
Good work
Excellent service.. very satisfying experience..will definitely recommend..
Nice experience üëç
They don't care for customers, just cancel booking and waste our time, no body calls up,
Booked these guys for a home cleaning service. The package was essential home cleaning which did not mention that its for an empty home. Get a call from the assigned service person that I have to book the premium package that charges rs 2000 extra if I want the home we are living in, cleaned. I went to check if they have an essential cleaning package for empty homes. Lo and behold, no such package exists. Since I have cancelled the booking, I am unable to get in touch with the resource person.
Excellent service
Worst service provider, no time Management and useless App, can't give one star also, person visiting on wrong addresses, for one service 3 persons assigned for different dates. Poor very poor don't go for there advertisement it's totally opposite...
Rs 98 more charges paid for the 2nd servicing.You dont have the cares for the customes. After 3 months why customer have to rebook for the 2nd servicing, though i booked for twice and paid. Bad experienced.
Very pathetic service. Taking the fees in advance but not keeping the commitments. End of the day simply cancel the schedule. Very disgusting.
Unprofessional. Professional has denied the service 5 mnts prior to the scheduled time.
Very bad experience. I serviced my ac and paid total 2000 for it stating that there was an additional fault in its PCB. God knows what repair was done and here I am facing the same no cooling problem within 15 days. Your customer support is pathetic, cant call you, it just says you will get a call and now it says it has already been escalated. I have a feeling i have lost my money to a bad service provider. Day 2: still no call back or no action taken Another 1* experience from Urbanclap today
Good
Worst Service. Charge 120 for visit and high repair/installation cost. Treating customers rudely.
Blvd 7 to y ET
highly recommended
They charge money with fake offers. Officials don't turn up from their side on booking and they don't refund full amount . Pathetic. Please do not use their service
Great for salon services and home massage. Not tried other services.
I have booked for home cleaning atleast 4 Days in advance and on the due date, I got response that team is busy and no slot is available. Pathetic service. They don't have staff for service but still they show slot is available and you can book only by paying 499 in advance and then no one will respond. They do not provide call center number also. It's better to get service from nearby local area.
Looks like the service and reliability is going down. I have booked appointment for electrical work on Sunday, assigned technition was changed. Newly assigned technition also didn't came on time when I spoke to the technition he told me he cannot come and also not ready to cancel the booking. Customer care reached out to me and said I have to reschedule to Tuesday, when I told I picked Sunday based on my availability, customer service told me they will get back. Still waiting..
I have been using services of Urban Company for a long time and I am very happy with their work. Very efficient and polite staff. Value for money. I tried deep cleaning for kitchen and bathrooms, drainage and repairs. Effortless services provided by UC. I am sorted.
Good behaviour. Very satisfied for the service.
Good Service...
Good professionals available, good customer support üëçüèª
Excelent
This has to be one of the worst service providers. The professional called me and told me he will do regular bathroom cleaning even though I booked intense deep cleaning. I added complain to their app and then they call back and tell me there was a glitch and the price shown is wrong and we want you to pay more. Pathetic sevice always!
Unprofessional painting.very poor finishing work
Very bad i hired for salon service once urban clap company automatic cancel my booking, I do booking again then profesional sibli ahamad aid she is not able tp come on time.she was rude also I will never take any service from Urban clap. Tum 1 star k layak bhi ni ho.
It has been lately a pathetic experience,with Urban Co waiting for the warranty to end. The support provided is very poor. Most of the times they don't call back, and when they do, they do not provide the resolution. I do not understand why some of the support centre executives do not wish to resolve the issue. I have seen from an absolute gem of a response to the poorest response in the same team. Sadly, I have been chasing the Urban team but to no avail with 12 reminders sent to them.
very much satisfied
Excellent.
Pathetic service by Urban Company, no responsibility of work. Incomple work, poor sales and support team.
UC Is Good But I Guess You should start with Nail Extension As Well ‚ù§Ô∏è
Very good
Service Worth the money we pay.
I made a booking for karwa chauth 2 days back, it got automatically rescheduled for tomorrow, 3 hours from scheduled time today. Beautician did this herself. Urban company was not aware and was even able to arrange for some other beautician. This happened to me twice . They spoiled my plan for entire day. Useless services and company. Pls never go for this fraud company
So bad
Very good
Good quality service,clean and well groomed professionals. Best part is they clean up really well after service. Have never had an opportunity to complain! Prices are on the upper side of reasonable
Pathetic service, zero commitment.
No transparency in pricing.... No proper UX design to show the hidden cost.... Technician told many customers are also facing the issue, but not rectified by the technical team
Good experience
There is no contact detaila and customer care contact detail to raise complaint
Gud
This comment is about the app 1. Can't combine two services. Like a carpenter's and Electrician's work. There is no cart. 2. Check out is a nightmare. Don't know where to set the time and make payment. Everytime. I get stuck after confirming the address. Very poor user experience.
Poor customer service
Simply Superb. No need to elaborate on any of the aspects. Simply go for it.
Not even an hour left for the massage,the lady called and said that bed is faulty so she can't bring it.I can't even cancel and book another session at the same day same time. If she had told me long before, I could have rescheduled it at the the same time. Even contacting the support team was a waste of time. Not helpful at all. They said I have to book for another day which is bizzare as I have a job that I need to attend to throughout the week.Worthless team. I will never renew my membership.
Very poor service... no call center... there is way u can reach to urbanclap... no upgrade.... n company is not bothered as all are third party vendors... customer satisfaction is zero
For geyser installation/uninstallation are two different services
Excellent and professional service. Good job.
excellent girl,professional working. I recommend everyone .
Very bad experience with UC I have booked it for deep home cleaning, they confirmed my booking nd on booked date they randomly msg that proffesional r not availabled Uc not valued customers precious time üòîüòîüòîüòî
Pathetic experience! Zero professionalism describes urban company the best!! They dont value customer's time! First they accept the booking and then at the time of service they will cancel the booking and provide no communication regarding this! Urban company is worst!!
ver good service and organized approach
They are simply looting the customer. Charging additional 50 bucks in the name of COVID safety where the professional is barely wearing a mask.
Amazing service and trained professionals
Done
Very good
Pathetic experience, their executive denies reaching on scheduled date after taking an online payment, if you don't have service available then why do you ask us to pay before hand , disgusted with you guys
Very bad experience for home cleaning I booked on UC before 3days full empty house cleaning of today they came 2 person and when we asked for another one they said that we both will do the cleaning but we were not assure for whole house cleaning .....I paid 4000 for whole house cleaning and when we told them that we want full house cleaning as we already paid for that they left immediately .....this is the worst experience. Now we are facing trouble due to UC such a pathetic application.
Iam not good experience it's not worth what I took the facial cost is high serving nill
Worst! The person didn't turn up despite pre booking confirmation and repeated calls
Poor sevice. I had requested for pest control for my kitchen for which I booked the slot one day before. One hour before the scheduled time I removed all the items from kittchen and 30 minutes beofore the scheduled time they say professional is not available due to high demand. If customer wants to reschedule the slot UC expect customer to inform them 2 hours before but for UC there is no time limit. Very disappointed. They simply said SORRY.
I booked pest contol from urban company 5 days prior. The booking was confirmed. The professional was not assigned. Raised complaint i was false promised professional. No one arrived. The company cancelled booking from their end. 1. If you dont have confirmed professional available dont take booking 2. Dont make false promises 3. Dont offer misely compension as insult to your customers 4. Prorities customers who took your memberships. Very disappointed with service.
Not good idea waste of time and money
Very poor service. No customer care number which you can directly contact. Once you book appointments they will not assign professional for your given time. I had already facing issues for my homecleanning. There are 5 days I am rescheduled my appointment and finally I cancle the service. I will Never ever use this app Pathetic service.
They cancelled my program. So disappointed. No proper service
Pathetic....its the second time in a month that I have been denied services and service providers keep asking you to reschedule the booking and in the last denies the services at the last moment and then you are in big problem after waiting whole day. Pathetic services.
Given 1 star as it's mandatory to make a review. Just "Faltu". Hopeless, for nothing high charges, disgusting services.
There is no way someone can contact the UC associate for any booking challenge
Very bad experience with Urban company, I took annual membership and booked for an applliace repair. UC assigned a technician, who didn't came on scheduled time. I Called him, he assured me that he will come after attending a call. I waited for him. He didn't come. They are not reliable. Worst service by UC.
need to get more professional..overall I like the service..Nice experience
Horrible experience with urban company. I booked RO services through UC on 21st Oct'21 for an appointment on 22nd oct evening 5 pm but the technician not reached my home until the scheduled time. When I call him to check about his status then he carelessly telling that filter is currently not available with me which is the worst and poor customer service from UC. Then they rescheduled the appointment without my confirmation. Please do not book services through UC.
Overall ok
I had previously given 5 star but based on recent experience I have changed the rating
The worst experience of delay of service , I face problem of delay of service for continuously three times., one of them I booked for 9 o clock nd till 11 am no professional assigned so after that I booked complain, than they told they r not able to provide professional, if they don't have professional than why they accept the services., no star for urban clap.
App is good. But their services are unreliable. Be ready for incomplete jobs, rude staff.
Even with prior booking for men's hair cut failed to maintain the schedule time and date and reschedule option was also not available for the same date.
No service at b level city
its nice
nice üëç
Bad experience fake person seating on customer care very bad service giving such a loot scammer
Very bad experience!
I had booked home cleaning services from urban company. The app does not contain appropriate description. After booking they are saying this is not included, that is not included.
overall good experience.
extra pay to both we did coil repairs brought we paid to repairs and urban app double amount is didn't understand
Goodbye üëãüëãüëã
One stop solution for all your housing need. Highly recommended. They made life easy and enjoyable :)
They fake their promises. No clarity on the app ....you will book for one service and then will get to know that this service isn't valid only. You feel cheated instead of feeling delighted
Very bad service in India. I had booked but the appointment was cancelled . Then what's the use of this service .
Good Service but service Charges are way too high
Why your assigned persons have to call before coming... we scheduled it , we know you going to come why calling before coming... you guys canceled appointments just when someone fails to pick your call
Best app
Worst service, never install this app, fraud people
The worst experience I ever had , booked service for house cleaning the guy never showed up . This is ridiculous
I book bathroom cleanning but no profesional was assign in time worst company is this i suggest dont book any services from this company
Sending goons to extort money, is their business model.
excellent Work by V Srinu
Booked for painting. First week they aksed me to reschedule as at the last minute their painters were not available. Then next week after working for one day they are saying the someone in ONE of the painters family is ill so NONE of the painters will come today. Very bad experience. They are not using any special equipment, so i don't see any point in using them in future if i have to deal with labor problems myself like this anyway.
good
Complicated UI. Cannot find the membership benefits. The company promotes membership in every booking but hides the membership benefits somewhere in the app. If it is something then you must understand what's the need for it. Can someone from the team tell me where exactly in the app I can find the info I am looking for?
Pathetic service. They don't have any customer care number so that we can call them. As per their convinent they are rescheduled your bookings...! Will Give 0 rating to UC services.
Good service
Service not comapiet your parson Daly
Pathetic service booked water purifier service got leakage 3 time and professional is not willing to fix it permanently..plus there is no customer care to speak to which makes it even more pathetic
So much bad experience
ÿÆÿØŸÖŸá ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤Ÿá
Since a few months, I have noticed that the service partners have not been punctual. One has to call repeatedly and follow up. There is a delay of at least 30 minutes.
Poor customer service. I have opted for bathroom cleaning, the agent forced me change slot which I accept and asked him to clean balcony which he want to do offline and did very bad cleaning. Since I was not at home while he clean I could not check. Hence, I called customer service for rework but they could not arrange saying it is offline and I need to work with agent directly. What the hell and why you allow agent to force offline service? Very pitty customer service.
Pathetic level of service, no customer care no available
Zero star to UC. I booked full home cleaning service 2 days prior. They confirmed my booking. So i waited whole day on the day of service. But they don't even bother to call or assigned any person who can come and clean my home. Wasted my whole day. I have to pass from mental torcher also. Because they don't have any customer care number. We can send request to call and then only they contact us. So i have to wait whole day for that. Pathetic and very unproffezional behaviour.
False promises made by customer service . Surprised to see this with UC. Now no response to repeated mails. No option to escalate the issue
Very unprofessional service company Had rasied complaint regarding ac service with 11 pointers.so far no resolution no action taken by uc
Very bad experience....totally disaster..waste of time
Excellent üëå
Very bad service no time management
Totally unprofessional behaviour and services. My booking has been rescheduled without any information. Urban clap cheats and does not care about their customer's convenience. Not a single customer care no to reach. Horrible situation.
Very bad experience. It is very deceptive, the services mentioned are not offered as it is, playing word games. The services you book in home cleaning seeing what they write, is totally different to what the service providers tell. It is horrible.
Pathetic service. Don't ever book a washing machine repair from them
No value of customer's time.Shifting to local alternatives.My gate has better service
Don't see any proper response from customer Care for any questions or queries asked by different customers
Excellent
I didnt get uc credits when i joined rheough referal. There is no option to contact for such helps
How can you cancel the prepaid booking after confirmation without any communication. Unprofessional behaviour
very unprofessional... service providers never respond the calls
Customer support is very poor, They give missed call and close the ticket with the below explanation Dear Customer, We tried to contact you thrice for your complaint regarding our service, however we could not get through. We are closing the query for now, please reopen the complaint via our helpcenter if any further assistance is required:xxxxxx - Team Urban Company
Good company
One of the best services available.in India.
some detail info needed choir some packages
Worst customer experience I have ever seen in my life. Super unprofessional! I would not recommend it to anyone. Not worth the energy and time.
Good
sofa was cleaned thoroughly and as per planned timing. persons were very corteseous
Very bad experience
However I have given the best rating post service but when I heard experience from someone else about Urban they are quite satisfied and the pics they have shared post cleaning was quite surprising and the service we got was not upto the expectaion.And this clearly states that it was fault of cleaning guy. Moreover I remember after my service when I told him that this could be better cleaned then he tried to convince that it's your myth and all. Sorry to say but my Ist exp. is unsatisfactory ‚òπÔ∏è
The best app for booking affordable services
1lakh out of 5 as per behaviour and work . The Best!
goodjob
Overall urban company is not good, as i booked it for home cleaning a week back,for today's date, urban company cancelled it today itself.because of today's schedule i cancelled so many other events.very bad Urban company and your apologies will not help as i suffered alot.
Over Promise & Under Deliver !!
PROFESSIONAL NAME - ADAM (Carpenter) Visit Date - 22nd October.. WHY IS THE REQUEST STILL OPENED ?? THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'M RAISING THIS COMPLAINT ON THE SAME ISSUE... CALL ME.. DON'T CLOSE THE TICKET WITHOUT MY CONFIRMATION.. WHY IS THE REFUND AMOUNT NOT PROVIDED YET AS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS COMMUNICATION... WHY ARE YOU CHARGING Rs. 169 When I'm a UC MEMBER ??? In the portal it shows as Rs. 118 only. WHY IS THE JOB STILL OPENED??? Also , 2hours delay by professional...
Paid 30k for a painting some walls in my house Patches everywhere and a poor job done
Easy to use, contains all the needed details.
Electrician charges are very high. Just to change a fan condenser, the charges are Rs 169/-. Outrageous charges.
Good service with extra efficient staffs.
I am trying to book sofa and carpet cleaning from last 3 to 4 days and then they say we don't have professionals to help you right now and that we will get notified when professionals are available and they never notify. Very bad experience this time
Professional services
I should give 0 star worst service.. every professional is cancelling after accepting the booking.. couldn't reach them after a clear conversation also there is alot of misunderstanding..worst experience
Very unprofessional...
Highly pathetic..if you don't have professional why the hell you have started your venture..
No Toll free contact number. The technicians assigned are from the location of the phone and not based on the address of service. The technicians back out citing location challenges
One Of the Worst app Don't ever install it Once we do the payment They will not come your home waste of time and money and space of your money.
The experience with urban company app was really good. I booked for cleaning purposes and the job was done perfectly. The girl sheela was very professional and I liked her work very much
You have mentioned a product which you have not introduced yet. You don't give service for IFB washing machine but you didn't mentioned it in your application
üòä
Expensive applicance for any service
Never expected this poor quality service leading to damage of the product
Excellent..quick response...
Today I sheduled the booking of bathroom cleaning. But before sheduled time the professional call n show his inconvenience to come n tell me to reschedule. I am very much disappointed because I have also lined up my work due to diwali festival. If the professional is unavailable today , Urbanclab should arrange the other one on that time for sheduled booking. it's not acceptable.
nice service
Not service timily
Disappointed with the commitment and non delivery of services
House cleaning and dusting :- You have not assigned any one for this work and didn't even updated what is happening whether your so called professional will come or not . Worst service from your side . refund my entire money along with penalty amount . If you were not sure whether you will able to provide service or not then why you have taken amount and said booking accepted? Pathetic service. I kept sending request on your app for call but no response. You are just cheating public.
I had booked urbanclap salon service and had completed the payment formalities. At the last minute booking was cancelled by urban clap and rescheduled without intimating me or informing me about the change. Most unprofessional and disgusting attitude without any accountability or commitment.
Very poor service.. Please don't take any painter or home cleaning services from urban company. These guys not come at the scheduled date or time and than call to reschedule it for next week and than keep on rescheduling it even after doing complete prior payment.
The service is really bad. They never respond in time nor keep their commitment. The app is also quite terrible, and most of the time, they are having technical issues with the app as well.
Superb services..great jobs
Thes guys promises so many things.. but never fufill it...!! 3 times they have refunded me on a washing machine service in which they were not able to assign a professional to it... If you guys are not able to deliver services please don't promise...!!! But customer care guys are very efficient...!!! They call you 5 times in a day to APOLOGIZE...!! Fed up of these guys.....
Had heard a lot about Urban Company but my experience with them was horrible. Not at all responsive and helpful. Deal with them at your own risk.
This is 4 th time the assigned person has cancelled the appointments by giving fake reasons and cancellation charges got deducted though it was cancelled by their service provider.. do not respect the time as well had booked appointment for today at 3 later the person cancelled they assigned new at 4 and till 4.45 no one came... Client service should be the priority but it is not ..
Commitment level so much poor...non reliable. Schedule arrival was 1 PM on today as of now, no one has arrived for work.
very good service
job well done
Very bad experience they accept booking but not assign professional on time in festive season specially. Urban CEO should work to improve customer satisfaction.
Horrible experience of my life. Company professional has not arrived whole day and made excuse to not come. This is not urban company it is a cheater company. I request all to not use this cheater company ever.
Pathetic experience, the professional was assigned for 3pm. And it's more than an hour, she hasn't arrived. The professional is not reachable. Absolutely waste of time. Please think twice before you take a service. No value for time.
Very worst company very bad eaxprience
Hi UC team,  UC rescheduled painting services from 20th Oct to 22nd Oct and then I was told that due to painter unavailability, booking will be either rescheduled after Diwali or cancelled. I talked with person who took booking and he assured me that he will initiate cancelation and refund all paid money, someone will call me. I somehow accepted all inconvenience caused to me. Now at least refund my money. This is worst ever experience. Email sent to your help desk, complain raised. No action.
Veryyy poor
Sofa cleaners done incomplete work. Not recommend this type of work with your proffecionals. Very unprofessional work and not bother of our timings.
very Happy
Very Poor Support. After seeing their thousands of ads, I booked Entire house deep cleaning services. By Friday I got my home painted, for Saturday morning 8.30 AM, I booked for cleaning. Also arranged 3 more people for household shift on Saturday. We were waiting from 8.30 to 10.30, no one came, after 10.30 we got to know there is delay. I tried to ask call back, there is no one to answer. I than posted on twitter, 7 people called Sir we are checking. Later they said we don't have team.
Hopeless service. I did my painting and again seepage issue in 15 days of service. But UC refuse to help. It's local painting services
Worst service ever, professional was insisting on cancelling, so that company can make 100Rs as cancelling charges.
Very good.
Not satisfied
very good professional
Totally disappointed from the technicians they took money while my booking was cancelled and they don't even tell that no money will be charged after cancellation and took my money after that I confirm this thing from customer care now getting money in my wallet back this is kind of stoling they are doing it was my first time and experience was so bad they silently took my money and then I get to know that after cancellation no amout is charged
Excellent service. Technician is knowledgeable.
I had done the booking for kitchen cleaning service and it was booked for today 2.00 but the professional Mr. Abhishek Upadhyay had cancelled at 12.00 saying that he is not well and reschedule for 2.30 but we are not able to do and he said we will receive a call but still no call. Worst service and no reply from your side. Please do not trust these people.
good behaviour ..... nice work done üëç
I paid for the monthly subscription. A chef came from Sep 16 till Sep 29. Then no chef came. I lodged several complaints on the app. I requested a call back. No response. On Oct 15, I get a call to renew the monthly subscription. When I informed that no chef came, I was told that they are sending a chef from the next day. No chef came. A fraud company. They take your money and do not provide the services. I am still waiting for the chef. People be aware of this fraud company.
Very bad experience. In terms of Salon at home Prime and Classic services this company is not at all trustworthy and there beauticians. One beauticians has damaged equipment and another prime service beautician didn't reached on time even she had not informed or call us that she is coming or not. When we tried to call her her phone no.is switched off. While booking and time slot they show the slots till 7.30 but after 6 no one will come for home service.
Excellent & satisfactory service provider.
Very bad experience stilm I didnot received any callback of after giving bad review. No customer chat and call support avaialable. And also no one hear to hear our complaints. Sevice engineer not repaired the product and not refund money no calls recived from comapny about service made. he is working on his own company no interventions in it. Very poor business and customer oriented service I ever seen
my first experience with urban company is nice .I love the service .I will try this again .I will recommend my friends this app
Thankful for providing at home comfort and taking care of good quality
Great Service provider
Good Service
Service was very gd. Gd human being staff and friendly nature .
very expensive.
Booking cancel without any information. I was waiting but no information about cancellation of booking. Totaly time waste. Slot shows all timming scare available but actually no service available.
Nice services
Good and timely service. But charges are not proportional to work. Two ceiling lights in our parking area not working. Bulbs have to be replaced. I bought the bulbs. Electrician removed the failed ones, put new one and wires are joined, a tape was tied on top. For this replacement of two lights hardly in 5 mins, after membership discount of Rs.50, the charges paid are Rs.328. Please review the charges. It appears to a bit on higher side.
Please keep well experienced professionals
Tecnician was an efficient worker who understood tha issue correctly n went about his job as a professional!.
amazing service
nice massage ...
good job
Get all daily essential serivce in time
All experience is good apert from LOCATION ADRESS , WHICH IS HARD TO SET EXACT AND THE APP DONT HAVE OPTIIN TO SET ADRESS MANUALLY.... This app is more of technogy oriented which is a problem when NOT SIMPLE and UNPROFFESIONALLY MADE.
Wonderful job done by your guy Mr.chadrashekar
Today was the first time I used (or rather, sought to use) a service from Urbanclap - this was a salon at home service. The service was supposed to start at ,11am and no one has arrived at the venue till 11:50. I received no information from the salon lady (Nisha solanki )about her lateness (she has my number of course), neither does she pick up my call, nor does the Urbanclap app has a feature asking me if my service has started on time. Pathatic service
Excellent service
Good
good service
How come you guys are charging 549 just to replace a tap
Nice
Used the service for appliance repair and electrical work and extremely impressed with the quality service provided by the UC partners.
Service was good and on time
Must try
VERY POOR SERVICE, WORST EXPERIENCE. I have booked the beautician for 3 pm as I have to be somewhere. Komal Dutta, the beautician cancelled it last moment and said that she don't care if I complain or give a negative rating. I urgently need the beautician for today and this was not expected. Really pissed off with your service ruined my plans for today.
UC is awesome options for relaxation
Very bad service my brother book kitchen clinging service but not proper cleaning and incomplete work so Very poor and worst company Very bad experience
Their help centre is useless as there's no interface for clearing queries about services before booking them.
Pls be careful while making home cleaning booking I order essential full home cleaning for 3999 , on arrival the cleaners denied to clean saying you have selected the Empty home cleaning options which was totally incorrect because there was nothing mentioned about It while ordering , when asked the customer care to provide me where this is mentioned they said cannot as now the service is discontinued , So they smartly blame the customer for selecting wrong options and pay extra for new service
It is very good
No help option for membership renewal
Feels like Purchased new Sofa after cleaning... Nice work
Pathetic services they are sending unprofessional people for your bookings.
It was a wonderful experience. Urban clap made my Diwali cleaning really easy.
Not my hellp avry Mumbai ctegre manjer
Good services
Good professional people with excellent service
No response for call i m not happy urban company
Best company & solve client issue properly.
Good service. No comments section in booking sections.
Worst experience ever. Never trust. This is a cheating company
Worst Experience with Service and customer care.
good job
Very unprofessional Cancellation without replacement twice in a row. They're even not refunding the membership fee that i had taken along with the booking. Bad bad business tactics and customer service.
Waste of time, they don't value their customers time.they hold me for the home salon services from last 2 days, after so many reminders given to them on very third day of my booking they only say the word sorry,which they don't understand the meaning of it.
Excellence five star rating carpenter services by professional as wellas by Urbanclap company.Really appreciable. Recommended to all needy
Horrible service,just keep client waiting whole day through and when the time of booking schedule arrive,a ph come wid a voice full of honey that sorry ma'am we r unable to give service today,and after taking the time for next day same thing tepeate again.now tell me what review u expect from the client.
Worst services ever!! If you wanna go for some unassured services, then go for them because no matter when you book, either 1 day ago or 7 days ago, they will cancel it without even asking you. They've caused me so much of inconvenience at the very last moment of my booking time and didn't even provide any better solution but they just called me up to inform me that they have rescheduled my booking on their own at the last moment which I had booked 7 days ago. Just horrible!!
Good
This is the worst app i have ever used. They say the beautician is on the way since 7.30 am but she is not here till 10a.m and finally she did not come. The staff( members) is such unpunctual. The phone no. provided is switched off and there is no way now to contact the so called "beautician". UC is itself saying that we r not able to locate the person.
fully satisfied with her service. very calm perfect in her work, friendly and very smooth in her work... paisaaa wasool
My experience with uc was working fine and then I took their membership. Now no one comes on time. Their phones are switched off. And uc customer service never calls back. I shouldn't have taken their membership üòï
Post work not owing warranty. Unprofessional
Please provide correct information in app half information conflicts between us and the compay. I have booked full home cleaning platinum scheme in app they have not mention that wall cleaning will be wet or dry so paying so much of amount Totally not satisfied with the information in the app
Worst service I have faced it's my first time with urban. No proper communication no customer care number. Really can't refer to anyone. Worst service no customer care support. No value of customer. Really worthless please don't waste money and time with urban clap.
I am editing my comment just to notify you people. Do not take their services at any cost and situation. Their so called professional are been trained to interact so confidently and can make you fool easily. I mean just to fix a basic hose pipe to wash basin they are charging me 830 although I have my hose pipe with me. Also they think our money grows on plants. Hahaha the plumper who came to fix the tab today said "mam this will charge you 249 extra for this" Pathetic people these are.
Nowadays in mumbai most of the flats have toilet, bathroom and washbasin in only one bathroom but some flat have different toilet and bathroom and outside washbasin which is comparatively small. If I book 1 bathroom to clean then the person cleans only one bathroom either toilet or bathroom . They say you have to book two bathrooms .but then it becomes very costly to book separate two bathroom and separate washbasin. I don't think this is feasible for one time cleaning.
thankyou UC it's very helpful
Very Bad experience with UC. We were scheduled painting work on 22nd Oct 21 but at the last movement they denied to do and asked to reschedule date which is showing after 18 days. Now I am finding other painters to do the work but due to Diwali no one avilable. So please book services from UC accordingly.
Pathetic experience with urbanclap. They never arrived for service and no response from customer care also. Your money will be lost....do not go for this company. Go for better one
Frustrating service charges till now. We heard good feedback from our circle. But it is bad with our experience till now. The AC resource called 0.5 hour before and inform that it will be late by 2hrs and for lock replacement carpenter says only labour charge is paid(which was almost Rs.500/-), and we don't have option to cancel without fee, when the consultant calls late.
Don't trust this app.
Good
urban company is too good so I am happy üëçüòç
Very Awesome Experience
Can't be more worst, total cheating scam.
I booked a maid service for 4pm the app accepted and deducted the amount as well. When the booking time came I checked at 4pm and the app said *cleaner on the way* for which I gave a little more time thinking she would be at my place soon. But after 1 hour of waiting the aggravated me called the helpline to enquire where the cleaner was and to my surprise I was informed that *SHE CANNOT MAKE IT SHE WAS NOT WELL AND LEFT FOR THE DAY* I was furious that why was I not informed at 4pm
Worst during festive season. Cancelled my bookings despite booking it couple of days prior.
Worst service of urban clap. Professionals are not assigned for more than 8 hours of decided time. No customer care response. No callback. Ridiculous service. Even people working in UC are tired of their own company service.
Best service
Dont take house cleaning service , bery unprofessional with lot of conditions
Complete unproffesionals. Untrained labours and untrained supervisors. Hosrrible experience
My 1st experience was good with urban, may be further they provide the same good service with a reasonable price. By which a common man can afford
I still haven't availed the service I have booked.tbe appointment for Satuday 23rd Oct for deep cleaning at 11pm, previous nite at 10:30 pm I get a message that our service partner will not be able to complete the service on 23 rd Oct and with out even asking me they have confirmed the booking for 24th Oct,8am atleast before sending the message you can call the customer and ask them if they are ok with it ???I am struggling to find out where can I reach them..but in app there is no way to reach.
Waste service close my Problem else refund Fraud company urban clab
Excellent work and very responsible. Shivkumar was very patient and ensured that all expectations are met.
Guys, the service is brilliant but fare is double. A girl named Zara will take the bookings and the cleaning guys asks to give cash or gpay to a person called Faizal Khan
I want to know about the disposable items which are used for the customer are reusable or disposable
Wroste service
work done well.
very good
Technician is so good in skill and cleaning of our bathrooms are fully satisfied
booked paint service for my flat and at that time I have given slot on 13th Oct, but on 13th I get call that they have to reschedule my service on 23rd I don't know why is it so. And if that is the case then why give me 13th date. And today is 22nd I tried to connect with customer care they told that you will get painter details on 22nd morning and till now j don't have any details and I am not sure that whether my work will start on 23rd or not.
perfect service
Company is not keeping a check on professionals who are are a cheat, charged around 9000 for repair and parts change of my tv which is again giving same issue after 4 months and I now learn that the parts change price they changed for was not actually changed. This is really bad and feel cheated just for having faith on Urban Company. I regret taking service from the company instead should have gone to local repair shop.
All companies provides best services in the start, as days go on they show their true colors.They offer free consultation over video but put a telecaller to speak to u who pretends as an expert. We had a leaking fridge, the person in the video nor the the technician asked for model number. The technician saw the fridge and bought a tray slightly thicker than polythene cover worth not more than ‚Çπ50 installed it and charged around ‚Çπ550 for that entire repair. Don't trust a corporate for repair.
Bad UI. It lets user select services, go through all the pages and says 'service not available in your area' on payment page! This is such a waste of time.
The app doesn't allow to talk to any person who is going to give you the service. U cannot contact urban company by urself u have to wait for them to call and this happens only when u book the service. If I have to get certain things cleared and understood how do I go about.
Wonderful experience. Thank you Urban Company for making working women life easy and hassel free. I am using almost all the services. One suggestion give some rewards or any other benefit to your regular client.
Good
Nice Work
very much useful app
Good service
farida proffessional gave excellent service especially bikini wax she did it with patience nd cleanup was very relaxing I would recommend her
I opted for TV service for No display issue. I had paid the booking charges Rs.450. But the TV was not ready after 10 days, i got my Tv return. But they collected ‚Çπ 300 for transportation charge. (I dont know why I paid the booking charges then. Worst part is, the fee is not reflected in the app). I was insisting the service person to return the tv on 6th day onwards. But anyhow, I have wasted Rs 750 with this service. Really worst people.
Quality is not consistant
I gave it one star for the offensive/racist ad. üëé
Our payment back log is still pending with you and u told us that it would be done in few days but it is month over but not our amount paid
HORRIBLE experience trying to book a service, you can keep waiting no one cares. All they know to say is sorry, what should we do with 10 times sorry?? I booked a salon service 3 days back for Thursday, no one was assigned for Thursday 11 am. When I contacted them, they called back and said sorry and rescheduled for Friday 5 pm. Since Morning a person has been assigned but no one turned up, I tried contacting 3 to 4 times no one helped all they kept saying is sorry. Finally am left stranded.
They have a lot of nagative points. Let me highlight a few. 1) A big number of so called 'expert professionals' don't even know the basics of their work . Some of them are extremely uncouth. 2) Charge is exorbitant in some cases. 3) These 'technicians' are mostly strangers so that can be a huge security threat if you allow them in your houses without proper checking. So unless you are too lazy/sick to go out or the service providers in your vicinity have dumped you, try avoiding this app.
stop running to get your work done
good experience
No customer care. Wastage of time of the customer, no response from the professional
My experience is horrible Worst management and unprofessional staff . Today i booked manicure and pedicure service at 6:30 pm without my confirmation the professional has cancelled my slot and rescheduled it without my Permission Pathetic UC they waste customers valuable time. Do u think customers are fools/ idiots to wait longer time for your unprofessional workers as if we have no work at all and there is no replacement no backup of your professionals i dont recommend anyone to use this app.
sincere and dedicated service provider
As soon as Hindu festival Deepawali is here, jerks like this company has started promoting pollution theme ads in their marketing campaigns.
Excellent
There is no customer care number
Pathetic Service, I booked a bathroom cleaning service on 17th and was not at home when the executive left. Unhappy with his service I left a message to him on chat and shared pics of the cleaning. He called me and assured me that he will come on 18th, however he kept postponing eventhough I followed up daily. Today I raised a complaint with Urban Company and they told the warranty for my service expired yesterday 21st and there is nothing they can do. Another shocking observation is that the App shows a 5 star rating given by me for the executive even though I have not rated him at all.
Froad company
it's good
Service provided by ur beauticians is no doubt awesome But facing refund issues most of the times
They don't take responsibilities of their own work.
Very pathetic management. No ac technician available daily in a row of 3 days! When yo don't have any service why you have open this company to waste people time! @urban
Super
good professional Heena begum
The best disinfection services company in my knowledge.
Excellent
anurag is best tv repair
Excellent service!!!
good
I've booked saloon 2 times. 1st time 2 executives called multiple times to reschedule appointments due to them having prior hospital engagements. And when he came the experience was not even near to what you advertise. I myself had to sweep off all hair and clean the place. This time also when I booked after calling me thrice the executive again had some 'fake' hospital appointment and wanted to reschedule to some other day. This happed after my booking time and confirming at last minute.
Disappointment, multiple rescheduling for a recurring customer without prior notice.
I had a very unprofessional experience as the beautician first took the appointment and then later asked me to reschedule it. When I rescheduled it there was no response from the UC team regarding assigning of the beautician and I had to cancel the booking. Its unprofessional and highly not recommended.
Excellent work done

I like her service
Fraudulent salon service providers sent to our house with fake Covid certificates uploaded on the website Service providers I'll equipped with kits and do not do the complete process Still no resolution on the problem
rate also high
They are cheaters. They charged me around 400 rupees extra for the services and then they said that yes it's our mistake, we will refund the amount, but after that they got disappeared, even not replying for mails and calls also.
First time to use the app requested a pcr test at 11 , no body showed up no body replied to whatsapp or to the complaints . And they called back at to reschedule for later the same day.. disappointing service
I am frustrated with UC now. We opted for home painting, the surveyor or the painter guy messed up the texture wall painting and the customer care lady do not care to call back and update on the status. We got lower quote from the local painter but instead we opted for UC as we thought it would be faster and better, but the experience is horrible.. Pls have the courtesy to call back and resolve the issue
very nice
Excellent!
Get sofa cleaning done... Reasonable and very nicely cleaning work done. Very polite n professional person.
Excellent experience
Very good service at your door step.. amazing Experience
Most of the Professional they assigned are always in hurry, they will do the service they have booked for but didn't care about any other thing. Like if you book for a sofa cleaning service, guy will not care about near by walls, nd in hurry they will leave a lot of stains on it. If you call a painter they will paint, but didn't care about holes to fill by putty.all they want to give them 5* rating. Washing machine installation and uninstallation, it's poor experience, they can damage ur items.
SCAM SCAM SCAM, UC is now doing SCAM with customers. Fooling customers. They started their own range of beauty products and launched candle pedicure and manicure. I booked to try and see whats different. Qnd it was a total waste of money. They did cleansing Scrubbing And then used 5 rupees wali normal candle ka wax for massage and then pack. Thats it. For it they are charging 949 for pedicure and 849 for manicure. A local parlour can provide a better service.
I have been booking prime salon service from 3 days 1st day they said professional is busy, will do tomorrow . I said I want 3rd day now, They said Ok.. on 3rd day they said professional will be late . I said Ok. But after 1 hour they cancelled service on their own.. i told them on phone also if u dont have time just tell. Still they kept befooling me. Worst experience I ll never book from here again.
Very bad service
All services are of named by professional only Our local people do same things with less price and by better way
Waist of money waist of time
excellent job
Service is good but floor was not clean. Video shows the new one. but actually it was only attractive for the customer.
very niceüëçüëèüòä
Beautician didn't arrive in time
worst company ever!! Dont ever use them ..so unprofessional have no idea whats going on in company..send cleaners from other companies so unorganized and unprofessional. My cleaner was booked weeks in advance my only day off with kids and no show..they did Nothing to resolve ..have no respect unprofessional managers cany fix any issues..Dont use them ruined my whole day off!!
full satisfied.....
Such an unprofessional service: Failed to deliver the service after two rescheduling
very nice and professional
Waste app
üëçüèª
it is a good service and have very politely behaviour
UC service is simply sooperb, my complaint was microwave oven, that was rectified result is totally satisfied. thank you technician Mr Sharan. üëç
Horrible experience. The app showed available slots but after booking no beautician was assigned to me. Even after rescheduling the next day same thing repeated. Please do not waste customer's time if you cannot provide the service.
very good service
Very unprofessional behaviour of Urban company technicians. They intentionally charge for different issues for the Services. Very very Bad experience.
Horrible. The guy was on his phone throughout. Dint complete his job in 2 hours when 85 mins was alloted. Dint even touch the floors. Stains were left all over. Wish could give 0 stars. And yes, extremely unprofessional.
Beautician didn't come on time also they don't provide any comp of, worst experience ever had
They do not provide a customer service number . I cant connect to them for any quieries. So it is a ridiculous app service provider.
I booked beautician. Everything was fine but facial service is not up to the mark..nd please remove honey wax if your beautician is not doing that for any reason.
Good and promt service. I used many services and all are satisfactory. well managed and trained staff. Quality service and best in industry.
Highly un professional.....
Best
excellent
Do not trust urban company
Poor skill of technicians. They say No for everything
Nice experience.
Pls pls pls don't waste your time by booking services on UC. They reschedule the appointments as per their own volition, without considering the requirements of their customers, causing severe inconvenience to them. I WAS a fan of UC , unfortunately because of some experiences, I cannot even call it the worst. It's level is sooo much lower than worst. I wish I could rate it less than one. PLS DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON UC.
Experience of overpriced in name material. To charge they estimates material more than double than required to keep charge high. After painting you will be left with extra material to waste. There should be return policy or go only without material. They will be reluctant as they are earning by selling material one donot need. However painters were good but urban company is taking undue benefit indirectly. I have left with unused 3 boris of white putty, bottles of paint, tapes, 5 pkt gypsum puti
I had got pest control done. Moin khan had done a great job. I gave him a 4 star by mistake. I would like to give him a 5 star. I could not change it later. Take this into consideration while rating him in the future.
Horrible experience for the first time. Rude carpenter who refused to do the job and said to book another appointment. The attitude was unbelievable.
Excellent service
nice app
very bad experience, seriously I am just waiting for them to clean my house while dilwali but didn't get to hometo clean.I choose premium full house deep cleaning and waiting from 4 days they didn't come and not ready to refund the payment even....
I am trying to book for paint consultation, but when I am going on the payment page it is showing no professionals available. I am from Gandhinagar. Custom care no. is also not reachable. Can someone help.
Best to use always
very good work done.
Always top notch service given.
I have booked for home deep cleaning and professional was not booked on the day. And they shifted for 7 days more.
Excellent work
Service Zero No Customer care support
super satisfied, I recommend to try once UC services.
I was given some credit and voucher which got expired automatically. Services were not used because of covid and now when I want to use credit and voucher show expired
Disappointed
good app good service team
Very nice
Very poor time sense
Pathetic. Charged me 500 for just drilling 2 holes for gyser. Tightening gyser pipe + 500. Just nonsense. It's just horrible not recommended. " Please read rate card before thinking it's affordable"
Worst product ever .fake company ever .i booked O3+ facial normally o3+ facial charges around 2000-2500 if you get it done in a parlour .But the product they used in that it was mentioned 270 Rs .then I filed my complaint. executive were not able to justify that price they said out of 1800 which I paid 270 Rs is the product charge and remaining is the professional charges.then they again called me and said ma'am remaining is the professional charges but it is not mentioned on site anywhere
Charges are high already that to charging extra for safety is too much for not following any safety protocol. Unprofessional people involved and damaged my special items
Non existent customer service. Better call local service guys. Too many loopholes in App which helps their techinicians to cheat us.
Fully satisfied, Experienced Professional, Quality of service, Timely completion of work Hassle free service most important honest and well behaviour but little bit costly.If costing may be reduced then Everyone go with Urban company
Overall goodüëç, highly recommend
Got my chimny repaired but came to see that filters have not been changed , though you have charged for the same . The company has played fraud with me . Please revert.
Sneha was very excellent and fast at her work.she is a nice person too
Excellent service provided under home cleaning premium package by Mr Manoj Kamble and his team.
Very nice.very polite and done the services effectively
please reduce service rates, costly service than others
She is very polite and calm.Carried out hr task with full dedication
Urban Company is great!

awsm service and Urmila ji very humble. she is vry swt
There salon service are highly pathetic. They give u confirmed appointment and last moment they cancel it. Highly disappointed and un professional
Dont serve in my area . So disappointed .
Just add computers n laptop service urgently
Very bad experience as they have no control on their professionals.2 beauticians canceled the booking in 1 day and, all they could offer is, a plain sorry. Won't book now
No customer care number for redressal, even for subscription members. Customer care only for namesake
good work
Money deducted while online payment but app is showing not paid I have paid twice
nice
Horrible experience with urban company paint service, third class surveyer without knowledge about paint job survey karne wale ko ye nahin pata ki pehle se kaun sa paint ho rakha hai, jo colour choose kiya uski jagah kuch aur colour bheja, paint khatam hone ke baad 3 din wait karna pada 1lt paint ke liye, superviser customer se paise mangta hai paint mkt se purchase karne ke liye, customer care se aap contact nahinkar sakte, jab unki marzi hogi ye tab call karenge, payment pehle de ke aap phas
Good
Amazing experience . Very frndly and nice staff .. hats off to their patience and work . Amazing work. Keep up the good work
I can see you have not send better professional in the right time. Once the professional has appointed she asked me to reschedule it ,later she is not available,later another beautician who is less experienced has been assigned. Instead you would have cancelled the appointment. But you made me to cancel and charged for the cancellation.
Pathetic service kindly avoid them
Thorough professionals and they have a panel of quality service providers who give service to our entire satisfaction.
very bad
They say "booking without any complicated requirements", then after you install the app and make a profile and give your phone number and email address, and as you are about to book, at the last step they tell you "a complicated requirement" which is they need an adult female at the location of the service at all time! I'm a male and I live alone, and this is why I need this service.... you think a company this big would have male cleaners! But no! Useless, uninstalled.
Unprofessional helpers very Unprofessional
they were on time and did good cleaning
No professional service. Service not provided as promised. Waste of time and Money.
Not trust worthy, and pathetic customer support
Horrible experience!They do not serve you at all....not being able to provide a professional even after 1 week of prior booking, wasting our time and not even compensating is what they are good at.What a failure üëçWish I could give .5
Very poor service. Bookings are accepted while placing order. But they are continuously asking to reschedule (to take service like next day or even after 2 days). If they do not have sufficient professionals, better not to accept the bookings.
Worst app. Their worker does not come on booking time they always ask for reschedule so don't use this app for services
Not satisfied ,not pure cleaning , incomplete work lack of traind staff , lazy staffs,in complite their works, no punctuality We are very disappointed on their works..
very professional and very good service
Excellent services provided by the experts
Excellent cleaning
Can't see rebook service option please solve dis problem
I will make sure.. I won't book any service in urban clap. They couldn't provide service for continuously 5-6 times and did not care to call back and try to arrange service. I would make sure I will not choose urban clap for saloon services at all. Thank you for your service.
Excellent. Skilled person.
Worst service ever. They don't have professional. I have booked kitchen cleaning service and the professional has completely damaged whole kitchen.
Irresponsible. Do not intimate prior to delay in arrival or cancellation. If we cancel the services they charge cancellation charges. However reverse is not true. Pathetic services.
good work
Based on previous washing machine repair experience, the CSR used non branded part but billed us for branded part
service was great
So prompt, punctual and reasonable. And the service agents do a thorough job, are transparent about payments and so well-behaved and helpful with other suggestions. Literally taken the hassle out of house repairs. Super happy with the 3 srrvices: carpentar (thrice), plumber and microwave repairer.
All Services are available in pune and services are available for my place too,but the women salon services are not available,so pathetic.... totally disappointed,if you are available for other services ,why aren't you available for salon services at same location...look into it pls..
Everything about UC is deteriorating including the customer care
Worst ever experience...My appointment for full appartment cleaning was at 11 am n at 10 :50 am they call me n tell no person is available..I was fully prepared..pls don't do this to any other..it was worst situation
There is no option to contact the call centre or customer Service in the entire process. Its one way looting and killing people time and money
I guess now they have started taking customers lightly. Not following or even knowing if the service guy visited customer or not. Twice the professional guy just didn't turn without informing and UrbanClal has no idea about it. I called both the times but no reschedule update. I guess they are jut not bothered with customer satisfaction now.
Good service
First experience is horrible booked pest control services and not able to provide professional from morning 8am .and at 10am they are saying they cannot provide services today .
excellent work üëè üëç
first time I try bt it's really good
Maids don't show up and dont call you (multiple times) customer service is not helpful at all (they don't have access to a good system and have no authority) and the app is buggy. Just don't.
Worst customer service
When Book any services forcsly add his add-on service ü§îüò¢üò¢üò¢
Don't go for this ,Horrible service,I had seepage issue in my home I called urban company and the person has charged me 5k and he gave me 5-6 month warrenty for service , issue got started with in one month, when I called to the same person but no response and no proper response from Urban company also.
Very professional Services. I am very happy üòä
Great service
Terrible experience. Slowest customer service. They didn't call me back for my kitchen cleaning query which the professional had. I was standing with the professional for over an hour.
I booked their services for today and without informing they rescheduled my booking time and then called to accept their assigned timing. If people have some urgency to go out urban company can ditch last min . Bad experience this time
Very Good Reliable and Affordable Services.
Worst customer service. Every time they assign some so called professionals, they end up not coming at their scheduled appointment. I've mailed customer support and no response from them as well. (This is not at all professional).
Chor company
Very worst service by urban company. Their so called professionals who don't even know the basics of professionalism. Fake and false promises & appointments. Unnecessary wastage of your time and effort. I booked their salon service thrice and eveytime nobody came and my appointment was rescheduled and again nobody came. Their professionals give silly & false excuses for not being able to come.I feel like a fool trusting them thrice and investing my time. Want to write so much bt word limitation
Very bad. The carpenter assigned to me wants more money which was so unreasonable.
There is No Manicure and Pedicure Service for Mens/Boys
Nice app very nice sarvice ...
We have booked pest controler with this app... they hadn't informed us that it will affect pets... I have exotic birds in my home... when the pest controller arrived... my exotic birds was out if my home only... I took birds in only after 24hrs of applying bayers chemical... but the thing happend is I lost 50 birds worth rs 5 lac... very bad experience...
Very bad experience till date, 2 services we availed till now, both are totally unprofessional, very bad
very good.
Termite treatment booked. After termination, I called and booked complaint but no one visited even after 20days of job done. Very poor quality and service. Regards
Pathetic. Poor experience in booking. Don't recommend to anyone
Excellent and prompt service by Sri Guravaiah , Plumber on 20th Oct 2021
Extremely unprofessional work in full house cleaning I don't recommend anyone to use this app for house cleaning purpose. Didn't expect such a bad service. Uchi dukan fika pakwan suits well on this company's service
Never used
best quality urban company
Beautiful service..
Very poor experience , and very unprofessional
Bekar he
Very bad experience
During April 2021, my house was painted along with water proof treatment by UC partner with 6 months warranty. The promised services are not upto mark. It was delayed by one week to complete the job against commited days of 4. With in 3 months paint started peeling off. I raised compliant and UC sent same vendor for imspection. however he might have updated flase information to UC. After that i raised complaints several times through calls and whatsApp. Till no one turnedup to resolve the issue
Very professional and good work
Please don't use any service.. this company is fraud.. please don't use..plllleeeeeeaaaaassssseeeee. .... don't use urban clap service.. bilkul nahi please guys
I took the message therapy offered by Urban Company, that was extremely good, looking forward to avail other services offered by them. Given Four Star as the early repair service was okay.
Really happy with the service...careful handling of the professional...all the stains were removed well...thank you
good work.... she is very polite
Not good at all. Female beautician are pathetic. They just talk talk and talk. They are more interested in ratings then work. I don't have option otherwise I will never order for female beauticians.
Worst experience.. The carpenter was supposed to install a study table but he took four hours to assemble. So you can image how professional he was. And extra charges were added.I have booked for your service yesterday but still. No response from your team regarding the same.
Pathetic ,at every appointment , professional use to reschedule it and finally did not came .Stay away to avoid your time and effort.
good Work
Horrible experience. Do not ever trust their working patterns. We had opted for home painting and were totally cheated by the company. Our quotation included primer for full house but quantity sent was not sufficient even for a single room. And we were asked to pay extra. The quotation made was totally wrong. When we tried to raise a complain, they told us to talk to the painter and then we were redirected nowhere. It is a total fraud. Do not ever opt for urban company for any requirements.
User friendly and staff also well professional
Pathetic experience
Happy
Plus subscription discount on salon services only 10% which I can avail instant of 20 %
Sorry.. but...No comments
great üëç
Well done UC
Satisfactory service
Very bad experience. Have given them contract for painting. They have taken 35% amount and now it's 10 days no one has turned up not even a service call whether the work has started. After 10 days also they are not sure whether the sevice will start or not. Very Pathetic. Not expected service with such a good name
Hi Team, App is not working whenever you try to book a service it says something went wrong. The worst part of it no customer care support for the app. Thanks
üëç
best of all
good service and good product
Pathetic services. I have read comments but still thought ti go for it but it happened with me too. I booked beautician for 5.30am and at 4.45pm i came to know that some another beautician will come that to at 7.30 and when I called her she sounds dicey. Never book salon services from Urban clap.
I hired urban company to get my house painted. I trusted the company. They provided me with the best material. The sales person was polite. We were told that we wouldn't need to do anything but it was a false claim from the company's end. The thekedaar was bad. UC should not hand over their work to such people. UC brought bad name to it's company sadly because of local thekedaar who is impolite, argumentative and disrespectful. Avoid UC, choose a better company.
amazing service, helped me to get my bathroom cleaned
No customer care no.. I had booked servise but no professional come at bookjng time.. And reshudule my booking by own.. Without my consern.. Very bad ...
it was so easy to cancel and reschedule. the services were good and puntual.
Gud but hair cutting charges are very high
Nice
Home cleaning services are very poor unprofessional and untrained people not satisfied with home cleaning service but I used other services they are good
App is not working.
Good Service
Impropreat services, Poor Customer Service, Heavy Charges copare to services. Negative rating... Not Recommended at all
Thank you Ritu !! she is an amazing beautician...I liked the sevice, it was my 1st experience with urban company and I'm fully satisfied.
I need help with the app, i just downloaded it now and its not working. If i try to request for a plumber, it shows app not responding please try again.
Very good service uc üòä
nice service
Worst experience, booked them for full house cleaning, they came checked my house thoroughly and disappeared without saying anything, how weird and disgusting
Bad service with bad professionals , if u got nice helper then it's fine else u will keep on call the company
Excellent
Prices of urbanclap is very high compared to the service given
Excellent very happy
Sbse ghatiya app.. chor hai sab yaha
good service...but what is shown in ads & actual is difference about following covid safety measures..seems urban company earning profits from PPE's charges collected from customers..
Useless and pathetic service. Called for changing my RO's filters as it was 5-6 months old. Post their service, the purifier has stopped working twice and they ask for 500-1k rupees everytime. Now again the purifier has stopped working. Pathetic service and trying to fool people by putting fake parts. Pleas go for local or your product's company service. You will end up paying double/triple the actual amount here.
Very bad experience....
Even after my request to add call option in app last year in May, no option added. Even their is no option for providing feedback apart from service. No option to chat or suggest some points
excellent service
excellent
Don't send this inefficient guy further for my bathroom Cleaning ....very upset with the result....
good service ‚ò∫Ô∏è thank you ‚ù£Ô∏è
The worst experience..for a head massage the charge is 349 but at the final stage of confirmation charges are 627..how much you just add on??
Joanna cleaner was amazing thank you
amazing app just loved it so much the nature of the employees were so polite
Hi I can't book for makeup in my area Can you please check,it is booking 1 km away from my house it's saying government service not available in my area what the hell....
Now not dependent on anyone for day to day work...like chimney cleaning, sofa cleaning etc.Overall happy customer.
Where is the customer care number? Pathetic experience. I've already paid for the services and now the services aren't showing up on the app. Now how do I avail the services. Is this how you make profit by eating the money of people? Sheer nonsense.
Froad app cheat app higer amount chiterrr app
very good service.
very good service
ery unprofessional attitude Had booked an entire flat cleaning On 20th October. I was asked to pay the entire amount of 5500/- And I waited for them to get back but no one approached finally gave them a call on morning and to my surprise they had no professionals to send for that day too. And not even for coming four days. I am surprised how do these companies survive, with so much of unorganized behavior.
Worst customer care services. There is no value for the customers.. they simply think customers have so much of patience that they will tolerate whatever worst support provided. It is really waste on spending so much on advertisements if you are not providing required support for existing customers.
There is no way to reach the warranty. You ask them to call you back and they disappear
ok app... the options marked after the service are mentioned in short... should be displayed in a proper way.. for a better response...
I'm trying to book classic salon service package from last 4 days but after reaching to payment stage it shows "no professional available" all the times! And it happens most of the times with your classic salon services which are cheaper as compare to your salon prime packages. Surprisingly In Prime salon packages which are way too expensive the unavailability of professionals pop ups never happened due to money making! What is the use of services if we can't avail them on time!!
Be aware of their services. They use duplicate spare parts which needs regular replacement, they don't have a good customer support, they simply keep ignoring you complaints, I am also concerned about their employees, whether they do any proper background check.
nice
complete app for all your need
Good

Worst experience ever. Booked them twice for full house cleaning. No one came. I paid 17000 in advance. I wasted full two days waiting.. then they deducted 300 rs from refund ? Why? For not providing any services and causing so much trouble for me?? By the way . I have not received any refund yet
I booked the hair cut service when I got leg injury. this service is Excellent even if you are a bachelor and can't go for saloon for n number of reasons. they kept a cloth under the chair and did the service and cleaned everything before leaving the place and service is great.
Had booked for 2 bathrooms to be cleaned. When the UC professional arrived he said that one has a bathtub which is not included in bathroom cleaning services. I told him that a bathtub is a bathroom fitment. You must include the bathtub as an extra in your app if it is considered as a standard bathroom fitment (though it is). The person then cleaned the next bathroom and after he left I noticed long (2ft) drip stains of some oily substance below the exhaust fan. My house had just been repainted
Deserving less than I gave
Very good experience since last 4 yrs
Not good. Horrible salon experiences. They are hiring third class service professionals and spoiling name n fame.
My hair colour is not done properly
Satisfactory
Becoming costly...charge flat 100 or 200 for safety and what not fee.. we are also wearing mask n use sanitizer, we should also charge urban company.. mask is not only for customer but their own professionals.. the cost of actual work is over n above and no guarantee of sending a skilled professional
Bakwas service, bunch of cheaters with fake adds
Their 95 % technicians are theives. They will steal money from you for no reason.. And the worst part is urban co. Doesn't take any action against them even if you give them enough proofs. Not recommended urban company worst experience
Worst app. I am disappointed lot. I have booked a plumber. The app charged money immediately. But the plumber demanded huge money for resolving the issue. There is no value or service rendered for the money paid already. This is kind of cheat. I am uninstalling this app.
Luxury spa is an excellent service provided by urban company it's a must try
I used this for salon at home. The beauticians are not well trained. They charge way more than yes madam. Dont have any customer care support. The beautician wont bring their own sheet. Unlike yes madan, you dont have option to keep the leftover product. Although, i've liked their cleaning services.
very nice service feeling relaxed and comfortable Thanku you so much...
Getting something went wrong toast as soon as i select any category Update October 2021: this issue is yet not fixed
Varry good sarvis company
carpenter work small issues fixing was very good
Manisha is too good with her work....very polite n perfect with her skills...would like to hv her services more often
good platform for all service's
Poor service
Not good facial all fake
One of the worst services. Please don't use this app for repairing your household appliances. They only fix your equipment until their warranty period expires and wash their hands completely clean. Use this app at your own peril. They completely damaged my refrigerator and now am left with a hole of 30000rs
I took device to repair my led Android TCL Tv. Excellent ontime service. Technically strong service personnel. Most dependable company
Excellent Service
Unsatisfactory modular kitchen cleaning Today l booked it for modular kitchen cleaning my utensils trolleys were mishandled and the worker was so unprofessional that he was not able.to correct it . Now l am unable to keep my utensils in that cabinet .they are unfunctional .
mamta chaudhary who was assigned to my service was not interested in taking up this service in the first place as she mentioned she has a doctors appointment . yet she kept saying i will come at this time and that time. i have call records to prove the same. she is a pathetic horrible and not at all professional. also i am disappointed with Urban Company in general. kindly refund the entire amount asap. and i will never book again for sure.
very good
Guy sent for termite treatment did not know his job. I have demanded total refund, to get the work done from other source
All the services of urban is good and on time.
Worst app and service unprofessional staff who demaged my AC and telling that we are not responsible..
not nice
service exceeding excellence
Worst app with no customer care number and Worst service.
The Spa services are the worst & this is over the years that I have experienced, it's better to go to a Suko Thai or Thai massage salons as none of the Urban Company "spa professionals" are really trained!!!
polite and experienced techs
Madhavi excellent profession
What's the point of registering complaint when there is no action, no follow up call on issue. Why do the customer has to suffer all this after paying full amount
Booked full home cleaning 1. Job left in between as partner had to leave early 2. Untrained team and a person who is not even employed by UC came 3. Throughout the day I was threatened that they will not complete service if I point out anything 4. The job was left in between by them and now no one has come for completing and I have raised complaints multiple times on the App too, but this still remains unresolved 5. Have already paid for the service and my service is still incom
Need option for choosing professional oneself, rather than one being thrust upon. Also need option for choosing haircut & hair color application services in one booking itself, rather than separate ones.
good
Much has already been told about how UC isn't customer centric. I too had a bad experience when I noticed they are just the aggregators of local service providers and don't really care about the resource planning, keeping time commitment etc. Even their training is questionable with a so called "professional" at my place cleaned the sofa with a vacuum cleaner without a filter in it, blowing the dust all over my house. And no, he didn't forget to put it inside, he felt its easy that way!
Good
Dear Team, We trust your engineer and complete the service around 4000 above amount paid online and offline. But he was not checked the TDS as per today Engineer Visit present TDS level was 7 only, And old engineer Nitin has disconnected UV filter and PCB. I was suffering from typhoid so my Dr ask today to check your RO. Today I open my complaint & your New Engineer checked and update about TDS issue, PCV and UV was disconnected. Is this type of service not acceptable at all.
Sai divine team work was very satisfactory. They work was very peaceful and helpful
No contact point to resolve the immediate issue
very nice service santosh shetkar
You cons why do you delete my review? To hide your frauds?
Actually I want to give -5 star. I have booked for Home dusting and vacuuming four days before. And the message has come that they will assign team before 1 hour of service. But neither they assign anyone nor they send me any message before 1 hour. When I contacted them through app the message came that their team will call me but no call for them. And the funny part is after the service time passed the message is appearing in the app that they will assign team before 1 hour of service
Quality services at reasonable prices.
very well and professional staff.
It was good initiative of video call free of cost. One can discuss issues that need attention.
Rude customer care, extremely lazy and irrational service me ...you must understand happy customers is what make or break a business.. due to the experience, I would rather next time prefer to hire a regulat clear than so called white collar cleaning guys
Very bad sarvice
I booked Platinum deep cleaning for 16oct. at 9am. At7.30am in the morning, I recd. a call that we are trying our best arrange people for you. Than after some time again I receive a call that we are not able arr Now the matter is that, when you have not provided me any service, why should I retain the membership.I do not want to  use any service of yours. Therefore, I request you to refund my membership fee also. With such a bad experience I am not going use any service of your company
Very nice guy good at work and behavior
so far liked all the swrcies provided.
am happy
Good
Forget about the App; improve your service and become transparent in your dealings with customers. You won't survive very long the way you are going, hoodwinking customers into paying for what they didn't want in the first place. Shame on you.
Feel free to book a service only to get persuaded to take a more expensive service
Team of thieves exploiting workers and providing substandard products.
Complete material for the project was delivered in one go. Not everyone who were involved in the project execution were aware of the full requirement
I have booked 9999 monthly plan for a chef. After couple of days , chef informed me he had an accident and company will send an alternative chef for some days. But for two days no one has turned up . And company doesn't give a damm on the money the customer has paid . I heavily urge to compensate the days of the absence of the chef by extending the due date atleast. Booked a complaint on the app. No reply back so far. Still now I couldn't find any customer care number to talk on the issue.
Seriously very poor and pathetic service and urban company is fraud my booking was today but still no any executive was come and I was made the payment also but still no any updates all advertising is fake to there are no any customer care support and not getting any help I request you please don't book anything from urban company it's fraud
The worst thing of your app is you don't have any direct communication option to reach out to you guys in case of any issues of booking/ cancellation and you guys call yourself as PROFESSIONALS.
Perfect solution for small or big Services
Good user experience except for a couple of goof ups.
Terrible Service... if you do not want to waste your time and money please avoid Urban Company... they take money in advance and schedule an appointment but nobody will turn up as per schedule and then when you call up to complain they will reschedule the appointment and again nobody will turn up... post that if you raise a call back with their customer support team... they will tell you to go and complain wherever you feel like... complaining to their founder Abhiraj Bhal is useless... frauds
Very poor service, they don't have any customer care no. Or any other mechanism to resolve your complaints. They reschedule your appointment without even your confirmation.. And also if the person concerned arrives they always asks for more money by saying few services haven't been included in your pack or the area concerned is bigger and they have hundreds of other excuses to fetch more money from you.
Paint delivered 2 hours after Painter arrived. Work not starting as I am unable to make payment online as the payment portal of Urban Company is not working. It keeps buffering and then resets automatically to starting page.
Perfect service ,I vill recommend UC.
Urban company is truly a very unprofessional company and the people they recruit to do the job are pathetic. Professionals assigned the job cancel the assignment at their own whims and fancies or they give absurd excuses for not doing the assigned job. My experience with UC for cleaning three BHK apartment was horrible. The professional assigned the job assured me that he will reach on time and surprisingly cancelled the booking at his own end. Horrible company.
Very good, useful app
Very bad!! They Keep changing the date and taken the money and hasn't started working yet !!!!
Worst service ever hadüòûüò°üò°
TV service done by Mr. Anwar is excellent
Horrible experience....No one turned up post 2 hrs in spite of slot booked 3 days prior. Does UC think customer is fool/idiot to wait for your workers to come anytime in the whole day. Why do you accept bookings with advance payment( 3 days prior) when you are not capable of handling . Why there is no customer care number in your app. No commitment towards service, simply make fools of customer by making them plus member with zero service. Complaint registered but no response so far. Pathetic
The scheduling is shocking. 4 cancellations in a row. And rescheduled appointment is a week after. For home cleaning. Don't trust the available times shown by the app. The team also usually will let you know regarding cancellations a few minutes prior to the booking time.
I wanted to repair printer in my office but there is no option for that.
Not professionals , only in app pics lioking good , technicians are very bad they don't know how to work.
all is well but I think your service will go outside of the City
It's getting bad day by day
Awsom
Started out well, easy yes but professionals are at times untrained or lack basic courtesy. Worst is your policies towards customers & professionals, both. You don't pay them and they harass customers and you don't have a customer care service in place wherein we can reach you directly. Wastes our time following for things that can be purely addressed with basic professionalism. Uncool.
Excelent service done we are very much satisfied.
Very bad service . Sofa cleaning was pathetic . After serving there is bas samples coming from sofa . They are not taking any responsibility .
Good
Please refund my money back as you are not able to fix the problem. Same problem in my refrigerator is still exist.people should contact local technician instead of UC
Worst
Kudos for training and equipment. But let me ask you one thing, are you paying enough to your service provider. Lot of my friends told me that they gave their own number for further assistance and I experienced the same. And what is that emphasis on 5 start rating. The best way for feedback is customer calling trust me UC how do you know who is giving feedback. And my rating was 5stars before and the funny thing is I didn't even rate the app.
Yes app good useful
Very good
Good
Service providers are fully trained and give excellent services in all fields. Use latest technology and don't leave a mess behind, that's the best part.
Executives not as professional as expected.
Why does the app keep crashing while booking certain services?
excellent job carried out by the team
Excellent
Very bad system fraud customers
not done the job waste of money
good sevice and plenty of options.
Booked total house cleaning.....the job was done incomplete....kichen and many areas was not done properly . Two out of four boys were absolutely lazy and untrained...not at all professional. Informed UC ..but till now the incomplete work is not done. Highly dissatisfied this time .
service is very good
Chor he sale
Excellent service.Highly satisfied.
Excellent service!
Facial ka jada perfect nhi hai
Urbancompanygroup
Booked for the first time and lost interest in this service. I keep getting calls for reschedule and they never show up. Is the cancellation/reschedule charge only applicable to users? Or do you actually have some proper guidelines? Why show up all slots instead of the actually available slots? Hopeless and horrible.
Very good
Third class service. Vendors don't listen customers. Without service charge customers.
Worst app because dealer did not serve properly
Had pest control services from Urban company. Nice experience. üëçüèª
Bad experience with UC painting services .The surveyor didnt do his job well ,This ultimately went a long way in derailing the whole project .Completely lost faith in painting services .
Highly recommended!
CHEATERS! They show FAKE offers on their website to attract clients. Once the service is taken, they say "Oops! it was a technical issue. You are not eligible for any offers". I have unistalled the app and never booking from them again. Totally UNRELIABLE!! It was my first and last order from Urbanclap. WORST EXPERIENCE! Rude and unhelpful customer care!
Excellent service given
Never expected this from UC, i booked RO service Full comphrensive pack of 1900rs for my pureit which says they will replace all the filter ,after making payment professional assigned and he said additional amount to be paid.This is the level of treatment for UC paid member. Still no resolution
Useless app...the professionals are least professional...the customer support is also useless...worst experience...will never again go for it.. good for nothing app.
Does not provide proper expert for the category u pay ...neither bother of clients
Magic!!! Up to the mark always
Very good haircut and Service
Poor quality services Unprofessional personnel
Iam booked bathroom classic cleaning, but they are come and told me change the pack to move in deep clean, so iam change my package,and I pay G-pay,but still i open my app your classic cleaning payment is pending,I search your customer care number but I didn't get any number, finally I pay extra money how can I solve this ?
Ajay arjun hari by the great jobüëç
The professionals hired by them are very casual and don't take their work and client's time seriously.There is no point of booking an appointments as they'll give you services according to their convience. It's very tough to reach out for customer support and even if you do the staff is unable to resolve the issue. Very disappointed!
I was very satisfied with the work good job urban company keep going üíØ percent satisfied
Urban clap employees are regularly dumping waste/used items outside my home. During Pandemic times, they are dumping used cloth, gloves, plastic combs etc which is dangerous to our health. Extremely unprofessional conduct by urban clap.
Only one person was deputed to clean the kitchen. We had to help him in doing most of the work. Why should we pay Urban Company if we have to work with them. I had booked for complete kitchen cleaning but the person deputed for work didn't know how to clean the painted space. We were left with no option. We could not communicate with UC because we didn't find any contact number. Will someone suggest me how to rate the services of Urban Company.
super ..electrian is good polite and experienced
Good service.
good
I am booked for 32 inch lcd panel replacement after seeing the rate card of urbanclap. But when technician came he told that this rate card was too old. And the rate is much more as compare to uc ratecard. Why don't you update your rate card?
good
No proper support. They never come on time. It's better to check for local help rather than going with this company
Worst service in india .. degraded app ( over rated)
bhod achha clean kiya hai
Recently I received service from urban company for my top end water purifier, they have assigned request to the professional who blasted the same by replacing incompatible parts and collected around Rs. 4k from me. When I complained same to urban company they have given the assurance of correction on call. After that no response from customer care, I am not able to reach the number or no body is contacting me, so I request you to be careful, we can't trust these people
I was about to buy some services but after looking at the experience of others I changed the mind.
star super company
Not a Happy customer
Very very very very very cheating company and very dirty company
Good app
I always prefer Urban Company because I can get things done sitting in the comfort of my house at my own preferred time.
I have booked and paid for move in deep cleaning and they provided the service of classic cleaning, very very poor service.
each and every corner of.drawrs ..very well done ..thanx urban clap...
Excellent service by UC. No chance of foul play. Really appreciate.
Excellent
Very bad experience.... I have a program in the evening so l booked salon for men... But two professionals declined to come... One of them asked me for reschedule and another cancelled... I am really very much disappoinnted
My last luxury pedicure was a horrific disaster which left me with a scar on my left foot.
Highly unprofessional so far as Kolkata Spa for women is concerned
The worst for home cleaning. Very pricy for such pathetic service.
Very unprofessional...will never trust urban company...
I order geyser repair , and the charges for 300 and then service man come and tell geyser want to do service , and service charges will be 600 so total 900 per geyser , it is very unfair I know geyser is repair he came and tell same repair So u want to do repair and charges
they are 2nd Ola. who want to earn from customers & service providers both. without giving any great benefit to other 2 parties. no customer care. services highly charged with huge UC margin. they are also fooling around with customers. unfortunately we don't have any other option, hence forcefully have to use their services until we find better option
great job
Very bad experience no contact number available no professional assigned even after paying before such a waste of time and money I will not recommend anyone to use this app and service
Very bad experience they don't respond on time they don't assign professional on time they don't even give slots to reschedule service very poor service they should close their company waste of time and money given them prepaid amount still there is no response very poor service I would recommend everyone not to book any service from here
Very Bad experience with all the technicians are fraud by nature.... they always suggest the nonsense advice.
Very bad services
It's been agreat experience with UC
Worst experince ..!!
Excellent service provided by urban company. Saqeeb was very professional. Thank u.
Worst service..
I have opted for Painting Services for Urban Conpany. Painter has absconded from site since of 12.10.2021, citing Grand Mother has expired and on 13.10.2021 same painter has reviews posted of service done at other site. DONT UNDERSTAND IS IT A JOKE WITH US AS CUSTOMERS. URBAN CONPNAY, PLEASE HAVE HONOURS TO REPLY.
excellent service
The membership thing is a complete trap. Before taking the membership every service is cheap and the moment you pay for membership, the price of every service is increased and they are making a fool out of us by giving discount on that service.
FESTIVE 100 Is a FAKE. Too expensive. Stylists frequently cancel and ask for cash payment because they claim they are getting it late from Urban company. They refuse to colour moustache and french beard even though I had mentioned this when booking. Then I had to cancel as he also asked for cash payment. Where is your contact number? If I want to clarify on some things
No use , littrally no use , I have used service pest control , paid 1450 and still cocroqt are roaming in my house and WHERE CAN I CALL FOR COMPLAINT I don't know UC don't have customer care no. Very disappointed , is se to acha kisi local bande se kam karwa lo yar .......
Written we will take 648 but taken 1200
My washroom wasn't cleaned properly so I asked for a revisit. The professional cancelled the booking. The company promised another revisit today at 8am. No-one turned up. So guys it's like this if your work is done well , it's fine. If there's a problem ,the issue doesn't get resolved.
Honestly cannot waste more time writing a detailed review. They haven't turned up for two days despite repeated calling. The whole company seems to be a scam . The customer care calls back rarely but it's not like they care. I think even the managers and everyone is in on it. So don't think escalating any problems will help. They don't care
I book for 11 and uc self change my booking time when not when I am not available. There no customer support from you there no number for calling costumer care
Very nice services provided... excellent work done by their professionals.
good
Alternative number facilities to be inserted.. I was keeping inform from last 2 years.
üëçüëç
The masseuse are exceptionally good. Mostly the girls from northeast .
Urban company ke professional bina bataye booking cancel kar dete hai bhout hi kharab technician hai urban company me or time pe bhi nahi pahuchte hai system badlo urban clap or mujhe jawab do
UC gave the opportunity to be groomed anytime!! Salon at home is a boon for busy ladies. But yes professional of preference and slot time availablity is not good always.even the customer care should be easily accessible. Prices of same service is different in different categories. UC please resolve these issues.
Worst experience I faced ever.. my skin came out and it turned into red patches later.i want to show the condition of my hands if there is an option to upload a pic...I wish I could give below one star ..not going to call anyone from urban company....really terrible experience..
It's very safe and easy it save the time and our leg pain guys don't think twice just download and start your 1st booking
The good apps becauseThe always best clean and Science for urban club company
Very very unhappy with the bathroom cleaning service... The professionals and service they show to us is totally opposite to the person they send us and the service.. Didn't clean the closet and few tiles were uncleaned. If I Could have called the local cleaner he will do the best service for lesser price... Totally waste of money and time...
We tried to book a pesticide service through this app, the first spray was done on time but after that professional was denied the service stating health reason we told uc to assign some other professional , they didn't do it on the required date but they assigned someone else who even after accepting the booking denied the service , there is no customer help in uc even if we ask callback they never callback worst app lost our money and didn't help with a single cockroach also.
Very bad experience with urban clap kitchen/bathroom cleaning services, second time in a row. Professionals are in hurry to complete the job without even completing full work. Like today professionals said job is completed while floor cleaning was not done. And I am finding many fittings/surfaces like fridge top are not even dusted forget cleaning with wet cloth. Not satisfied with service, I don't recommend using urbanclap. I feel being looted with membership fee also.
Price is too high and also there is no customer care service number to whom we can complain
our experience is the other way.  We gave our 55‚Äù Sony television for repair through Urban clap on the 14th Aug 21. Their service provider Srinivasan Electronics, (No. 33, T H Road, M R Nagar, Kodungayur) promptly returned the same on the 17th.  However, immediately after they left, the unit was not functioning and we complained to Urban clap who made the Service provider viz. Srinivasan Electronics to take the unit back
super service...
Good before time visited and done, very professional
Chor hain ye log
Very good amd polite service persons. The option of choosing your prev service person is v good.
Do far it was a good experience.. punctual and professional service.
best service from nisha .. amazing experience.. amazing work
Great job by urban company
Wonderful
Pathetic in house cleaning services....don't book service at list for cleaning...u just wast your money and harsh your self along with time..
Unable to reach customer service for queries
Good work
superb service
I use this app often but this time the beautician arrived and later denied the service demanding me to make the payment directly to her.Pathetic Experience.Even after requesting for call back I didn't receive it .
Very good service by Mr.Venkatesh highly recommended
Whitewas started after full payment. Team is not coming to work regularly. Whole work estimate was 5 days. After three day not even a single room is complete. STUCK BECAUSE FULL MONEY IS PAID BEFORE WORK STARTED.
we have booked a service for cleaning our bathrooms and it was worth every penny. Thank you Urban Company
Professional always conflict once visit home. I booked for sofa cleaning but professional asked to count puffy as individual seats as well as cusion which is part of sofa as seperate item. This happened to me and my relatives in past as well. Please do not go with urban company and check other vendor. Urban company charged 50rs for safety but professional visited my home did even wear mask and they charged for PPE kit.
Happy with the service very professional
Don't use this app.
Horrible experience because of unprofessional people associated
not providing customized products rather a fixed products and price, forcing to spend a lot
Overall we are very happy with the service. It's professional and very clean
Good service provider but require more detail in service description
excellent therapist
excellent
No contact details if one wishes to talk/complain.
Both my requests were not met the carpenter was not assigned, the beautician asked me to reschedule
I never had this kind of horrible experience with urban company. It has been 3 days since my complain was registered. Still there is no response from your side. Are you people really care about your customers?
Good services
Worst experience with pest control, professionals denied services so many times and no help from the company . Waste of money and time
Got refund but very late
I liked Poonam Singh's work, she's is polite and good at her work, she gave me good foot massage üòä..
We commited a mistake by downloading this app. We never had such a bad experience dealing with anybody. The painters who came at our house were pathetic and the expert did not help us even after a lot of complaints. Once we paid him the money he stopped picking our calls. The painters were so rude and irresponsible that they almost broke our TV.They didn't even follow covid guidelines. We will never use this app ever again.
I liked the work
the extra 39 rupees I am paying for safety measures is not applicable on my services. Hence I want a refund on the safety and support fee.
good
Nice company.... I like it...
Excellent Service
No service just wasted my time even after booking waited for two hours
Worthless go to the local market and get more convenient options
I had one service which wax waxing full hand full legs and underarms which was not at all good and was incomplete coustomer care told me that you will get next service all free of cost but now m not able to do that they are still asking me to pay for it.
Experience was bad with last booking .had facial zero effectiveness on skin .
good
Very nice
Useful app
The service was beyond of expectation... Superb
job well done
M changing my ratings from 4star to one now just because of the my last experience of salon service. The lady didn't look like any kind of professional and literally she was continuously bussy with her phone calls and chats.
The professionals and services are top notch and have amazing experiences with UC.. They are my first choice and would be really okay to pay a bit premium price to them because of service experiences :)
Service is accurate and experience is good.
I took deep cleaning& washing machine services today.service staff is forced to give 5 rating. Rating that we are giving, they are not accepting. They are saying they won't get their next assignment if we don't give excellent as rating. Did not like that really.Forcing the customer to give 5 rating ,I really did not like. Feedback is something which should help you improve. They kept the waste outside my house & did not put it in the dustbin. Even extra money is given
Not at all true worth. urban company claims to give timely service but that's not true. I had Booked my services 1 days prior but the beautician didn't turn up and she informed about the same 5 minutes before to the set timing (3pm).Urban company is such unprofessional that they rescheduled my services without my consent for 6:30. Never trust urban company when there is urgency as they will never understand the delay or disappointment that you will go through. Refund my membership & service fee.
Bad experience !! First time order for 2BHK deep clean - Manager denied to remove and keep the goods from the location .. without that how one should can do the deep clean and goods we have to remove then what is meaning of deep clean ? That lady don't bothered about lossing one order also .. very high attitude .. not recommended .. better call someone whoom you know it .. they will do it and better way .. not even proper no to communicate as well.
Bad experience with sanitizing.
Awsm
Never take services from this company .When we were facing issues with the vendor,we did not receive any help from Urban company guys. The main reason for selecting this company is that it will work as an intermediary between the customer and vendor but our issue was resolved by ourselves.
V good app
Service persone behavior very bad
overalls very good service
There is no option in the app to write to customer care for any query
Very very poor service.....
Nice
Mr. Karthikeyan has done good job. I am satisfied fully.
The most pathetic and unprofessional service provider company ever seen. Either the professional is never assigned, when assigned ana amateur comes and makes a mess, when trying to raise any issues no response/ no resolution. Ready to charge cancellation fee, but what when customers all plans are shattered when professional isn't assigned/ doesn't come? Never recommending this to anybody. Would have given negative stars if possible.
Very bad service and the employee tried to cheat customer. Had two times cheating experience. I am totally shocked previously so nice the company is
Prices are heavy ,cant affordable compared to local services and Electronics anyways both does the same job.
ac servicing was done very nicely
Very much unprofessional.Send a carpenter who is froud.Took money as advanced but not came after that. And dissapeard.
Sometimes one get deceived by advertising campaign and positive reviews of companies and believe they would be trustworthy. I took the hair cut service for my child after believing they would do their work efficiently & professionally. During booking the slot I took the option of 10 AM. For next 3 hours their was no communication when they will send their barber. Finally the barber came after 4 hours. He did the hair cut of my child like sadak chap barber. Total waste of money.
good and vert usefull app
excellent service.....
Unprofessional attitude. We booked for apartment cleaning on a Sunday but no one available. Harassment
Even the deep intense cleaning of bathroom was below average and totally unworthy .Completely unsatisfactory .
I had the best experience.
nice service
Shows wrong slots of professionals, happened multiple times. Check the availability before showing it on the app
Mr Shyamlal very good and professional 50 service
Highly unprofessional behavior of UC partners in Patna. Twice has my booking been randomly rescheduled to the whims and fancies of the partners. Very disappointing and unreliable. Please associate yourself with reliable people else your credibility will go for a toss!
Cancellation fees 100rs No update if booking cancelled or not No prompt customer service Time consuming
Worst ever experience with UC. Got my new flat cleaned but it seems like it was never cleaned at all. No customer support. UC sucks. Request all to not install this app.
Customer care number not visible on app
Tejaswini was really good and very professional . She was on time and done as per my requirements thanks Pranita Shastry
Good Service by Yuvaraj by did a good job.Thanks to urbenclap
great service
No backup services available for equipment failure. Was forced to cancel. If customer cancels the service they are charged cancelation fees. Had cancelled an important event ans planned for this services. Very unpleasant experience. No call center support available to talk.
Very horrible, company is not responding properly. After taking a booking and payment they are not responding properly. They misbehave and harass their customers.
perfect service
Nice
Committed professionals. The services can be relied upon for efficiency and costing.
Excellent service
Stop calling back ppl for visiting a certain section of your app. It's bloody annoying. If we really want your services, we will book on the site or call
I had booked a package of 2 services for my 2 window ACs. First service is availed and now there is no option to book second service. Money lost. Worst this about the App, there is no option of putt any complaint. Payment is taken in advance and there is NO Grivance redressal sysytem. Contact US option is missing.
I have paid for two services as told by the company.one service done earlier..waiting for second service
Services too good‚ù§
In some areas
Tried twice... 1.Customers are getting cheated with higher charges by so called professionals - who are untrained and thugs who UC is partnering with. 2. On call englosh talking executives talk as if they are doing favour to customers. 3. My refrigerator was damaged an the insurance claim was declined. Unethical ppl who handled my case( 16th and 17th Oct). If there is any proces to Audit the calls and such ppl.should be sacked for misguiding customers & trying to protect the person who damaged.
Conflict of commitment with sales and painting professional. No proper communication channel with urbancompany. Raised a complaint but no call back , no refund , no cancellation. Could have given -ve rating if any , dissatisfied. Do ur due diligence before paying any amount to them.
Veri veri good company provide professional thanks you arban company
I am always overcharged in my last 3 complaints,ad mentioned in app.
expensive service of urban clap
Customer service support is very rude, don't pay online. After work. Because if paying in advance they talk like a king if any issues.
I booked my first appointment. It got cancelled automatically. Worst experience.
I had booked a painting consultation along with cleaning, but no one was sent for painting. I called twice for refund and yet don't see anything initiated. Absolutely pathetic if I have to keep calling customer care for this. I was informed money would be credited to UC wallet which ideally should be an immediate process, even that didn't happen.
Best app with professional employees Highly recommended
No ads
Horrible and terrible. They have no customer care option and their professionals cancel the service and we can't contact them
If you do not have professional available to serve in my area why you have charged UC Plus membership fee and there is no option under Help center to report the same.
In the last moment UC reshudled my booking from 8.30 am to 3 pm I had a flight to mumbai so I had to cancel my flight because of UC
painless service
Hidden rates are there which add additional cost
Booking done for plumber in the time slot of 9 to 9.30 AM, plumber came at 12.30 PM after repeated calls. Basin mixure was installed well within 15 minute . But UC has the same instalation rates for sink mixure and basin mixure wall hung or counter top, rates should be different for both because wall mounted sink mixure take more time for installation , the rate mentioned in the list is ok for wall mounted sink mixure and basin mixure installation rate should be less.
Plz add terrace cleaning service...it's important
Bad do not give clear information and then they want more money ask us to upgrade package v v bad
One of the most pathetic app I have ever seen. I booked service yesterday they assigned me one professional after that she called and given me some reason that she can't come then urban company team told me you will surely get this service for tomorrow now they are asking still there is prblm we can't assign I said it's you should cancel for that also they are not responding. I can't contact then anywhere .
Very high prices. Do not try for gyeser installation they are very very expensive. Be care full before do big mistake.
Great
Poor customer service and under certified and under trained staff
Excellent service
Why do you list out Make-up and Hairstyling services if it's not done anymore. I wanted to book for my daughter naming ceremony but was unable to do so. Later found out that they have removed those services. The worst part is I enquired about this package by via their email help support and they easily answered all my queries. The support could have informed earlier only that those services are no longer provided. Very disappointed
professional and great job done
Pease full...proffessional work
Very good professional
Worst app till now Hard to operate and back office persons not attending properly
It's a pretty good app for services in Delhi.
Suddenly urban clap has started assigning men for women's hair care services without giving the choice of opting for a lady. What kind of service is this ????
Very nice service üëå ok
Very excellent service üëå
Best service one can opt.
Very good, punctual, dedicated team.
Jenny wangsha...she is really good...iam feeling very relaxed..she has 7 years experience ....she asks your pain and heal us with her massage...she is good at knowing pressure points...her massage is highly recommended....she put pressures where needed and my pains actually gone.....she kept things sanitized as well...
this 5star rating is for the person not for compnay
Urban company service man forced me to change all my water purifier filters twice with in a duration of 3 months,paid around 7000, feeling cheated. Please avoid such wrong practices to retain customer trust.
best service
Good but professional doesn't make threading proper ...poor result in threading...nd only mask wear no any safety measures use like sanitizer, mask sheet etc
Never ever opt for any service.... Trust me u'll regret ur decision later... Rather go for local vendors... These people vanish after making the customer pay in advance... And even after advance payment they don't even match the expectations of customer. No response from customer support and supervisors. Useless staff...Useless company..... Thieves of modern world.
Good service good team Theri music that is Star for u.c partner is very good for sabuj miaj team chennai üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
I used urban clap for White wash, trust me it was a fantastic experience, everything well managed, they bring everything on their own including cleaning clothes thinners to clean etc. they won't ask for anything from you. fully satisfied. thanks urban clap.
2nd service not done because I pad 2 service
Awesome service...Loved it
Booked Ac repair and service. Professional executive and service was too good. He was polite and took much time to check all the stuff and fixed it neatly. Best service ever!
Good
Where is the customer care or contact number locayed in the app? We had booked full home cleaning service for today.  We faced lot of issues hence we canceled the booking. A lot of time and energy was wasted in canceling, rescheduling the booking. This is the first time we experienced such service from your company. We could not find a way to reach you through the app or phone call.  1. One of the cleaning staff was stinking with bad smell which remained in our house for 2-3 hours after they
excellent work great job üëå
The most useless sales and staff I have ever experienced I book twice a week. They promised same Person will arrive which has never happened last three weeks. A customer care person will call and promise and nothing happens third time in three weeks professional has not showed up.. I am even ashamed to use the word professional... I have to reschedule my appointments because the person will arrive and when I call they pick the call and disconnect... complete Waste of my time and patience.useless
Never ever take service from these third class company.. Who never give good service, stupid Uneducated unprofessional s, they cancel service and don't care to inform
Keep up the good work
Kaleem did a very good job at painting
One the worst customer service ever. Continuous harrasment by their team without even them going through the complaints. They will all of a sudden change the pattern of which bank they are accepting NetBanking services and give contionous calls to harass you .
Useless and poor customer service. Yes Madam is a better service provider for Salon services. Good that I don't make advance payments, because the technician/ beautician are never assigned and no one calls from customer support even if requested. Ultimately, had to cancel the service twice! Just don't make payment in advance, atleast the money is saved!
very nice
Urban Company made domestic jobs pretty easy. Excellent scheduling and fantastic job. Thank you very much Urban Company Team!
Very bad experience. It's the first time I used urban company and booked a slot for cleaning. The technician has not arrived.
helpful app, timely support provided at an affordable cost for all kinds of domestic urgency.
Had to clean sink blockage.. was really urgent.. wait for so long and no professional were not provided and had to cancel
The app does not function cannot get otp waste of time.This happens frequently today partner is waiting for the past 1 hour for otp.No answer from help line.
Good service
very disappointing...do not honour bookings....last minute inform us that beautician is not available...
Excellent service
Why am I charged seperately after service when there was clearly no receipt given for the same. The service man asked to wire him directly than the company. This is not right. People please be aware of this nonsense
lot to work on ui
Great initiative by urban clap specialy the parlour service
Changing my rating from 5 to 1. Over promise, under deliver 3/5 times. Washroom cleaning service is useless. The guy did nothing rather created more work to be done after he leaves. Did nothing.
Overcharged ( charged 350+ for minor screw tightening work
never suggest Dulux paint for your customers
Aim of the company is to robb the customers. They collect charges just to send technician at your door. Main game started thereafter. In the name of repair or change of parts they charge you hefty amount. No bifercation of charges they have disclosed on their app.
it's was really a good experience..
Not even worth for 1 star. On 19/09/21 the contractor named Virendra visited the place, gave qoutation for repair & painting job, with his professional suggestions we agreed for that & booked 16/10/21to start the work.. But on 16/10/21 their behaviour changed, the approach was like they can work on their own wish, they r list bother of consumer complaints.Support team compelled us to cancel the order or postpone for new week, which is not possible. A pathetic, unprofessional organisation.
I did a big mistake by giving job of house painting to Urban Company. Highly unprofessional and inefficient bunch of people at UC & they take 100% money in advance before even starting the job and you will get stuck with them. Didn't deliver shades on time. Work didn't start on time. Wrong shades were delivered at my home. They sent a 16yr old child for the paint job. They don't follow covid protocols. Untrained labor. Lot of iconvenience to senior citizens.ZERO customer service. Disappointed.
It is not all good service no help center calls and service was very bad plumber service and expensive more than actual only before only it was fine after they done it became worst our 8k was wasted don't waste your time and money for this bullshite services app
My experience was horrible. I booked an appointment which was immediately accepted. They were to assign me a technician. The next morning I get a call almost 3 hours before my appointment that there was no technician assigned yet but they will try my best. After that I kept trying to get in touch with them dropping multiple messages requesting for a call back but neither a call back nor a technician was provided. It was finally past my appointment time when I had to cancel my appointment.
If there was zero in rating i will definitely give it... Not thirdclass... But there is no class service
assigning service person should be better. had to postpone be os no one was assigned yday
Great App, Great Service
good
No services available.
The worst ever experience in service industry. Took appointments confirm it. Alot the agent then at eleventh hour call to cancel the appointment. Remember I am there contract customer who have paid extra to get benefits as well. Disappointed and will never use them again.
How do I book for only window+balcony cleaning for all 5 windows+balcony of my house?
Horrible service....Absolute ripoff , the technicians suggest to install a new once instead of repairing the appliance and leave in just 5 mins and we are charged 300-500 for that... The billing should be done on basing on the work done after inspection, how can you charge beforehand.. there is no customer support helpline to rech out to .. And on the previous booking , the technician had taken money for a switch and that is still showing as an unpaid amount. Modern robbery , double charges
The service by professionals are fine so far i experience. However the cost has increased lot
U can never reach their customer care of u want to but they can reach u all the time. It's one way communication.
The worst company. They are incapable of fulfilling their commitment to the customer. You book and pay extra charge, then on time of delivery of service they call to reschedule. Not recommended at all.
The app gets slow in-between. There is np coordination btw professionals coming to serve and management. Not dependable at all
Good
More prices for less work
The service is nice. But the items which need to be replaced are not as sealed pieces. I don't understand why they not as sealed pack
Recently they have started their services in Meerut and I have booked. But I can say that they are doing a kind of scam. First, they offered you a service and asked you to book the slot then they offered ( not forced) membership kind of lollipop with discount. After some time you get to know the person will not come as per selected or desired slot. Then they keep you calling and asked for different slots as per their professional availability and surprisingly the person will not be available.
In the recent past what I have experienced is that the company is resorting to all sorts illegal, arbitrary and malpractices in case of billing. Even for specific issues they are charging visit fee over and above service fee apart from welfare charges etc and thereby nullifying the discount to members for which they are charging additional fees which is totally illegal and unjustified and deficiency. A complaint should be lodged before the Central Consumer Protection Authority in this regard.
good and timely service.
Yes I tell others
Customer service is disgusting no complaints are taken seriously only assurances
A real 3rd class experience from a world class company like Tata. Book them if you want to spoil your schedules & events. I booked 3 days in advance with advance payment but no service provider assigned even on the date of service. Neither you can call them nor msg not even call back on the helpline they called from. Bloody ruined my entire function at the last moment. Idiots kept on saying till the last minute but did absolutely nothing. disgusting
Worst services ever, I have booked the salon services, yesterday, but there is no expert assigned yet, n I'm getting calls on calls for inconvenience things discussion. Pathetic #worst service urban company...
I had hired for full home cleaning. They call next day to upgrade the services.. And utensl removal will cost extra 500 . They rnot professional cleaners but some jhoparpatti boys who don't clean as wanted. They just do the regular dusting nd sweeping which we do everyday. Total waste of 4500rspls don't waste ur money instead pay ur maid nd get ur home cleaned
great
Very poor provide services
They dont have any custom care to talk to if you are stuck with a bad service person. At the time of booking, you cannot even put a request on preferrence of service person. We wanted vaccinated person, but they assigned unvaccinated in two successive bookings (they claim that 95% of people are vaccinated). Their membership is a trap. There is no customer care, So I cannot take these issues with anyone. Even if they have a customer care, It is very well hidden. You cannnot reach out to them.
Professional told to cancel the booking as I have selected empty home cleaning for my villa whereas he claims it's applicable only for apartment. Such information was not provided anywhere in the description. He tells me to select villa deep cleaning, why should i do it when there is no carpet or sofa or any other materials. Pathetic service from UC over all by fooling the customers and now i ll be charged cancellation fee too because of you guys.
Great
excellent work
No professional assigned for 2 consecutive bookings!
Very smooth service by expert mechanics. Thanks.
No thanks
Very bad experinces with us
professional services
Very irresponsible and non responsive to customer complaints.
App does not work properly, it is very difficult to select preferred service provider
They are not giving correct time slot.they are give their convenient time,not ours.
Amazing experience
Waste service. Regret to be a UC customer
Urban company doesn't deliver what they promise, i had to attend a meeting and i scheduled a grooming session the executive never turned up for 1 hour 30 minutes from scheduled time. This was so disappointing and on top of that membership was imposed and no refund was received
service was perfect..but urban clas doesnt provide a contact number.and so i wasnt able to use my gift card
Good service given
good service
Excellent
we like the service very much
awesome
service was excellent...
go for it
Very worst service I received.. the technician has taken our AC for repairing , it's being more than 2 month . I didnt get my AC back . Everytime m getting call from customer support team and they are giving 2 days assurity for getting my AC back . Hut still m not getting .. please dont handover ur valuable belonging to them .. dont trust this people..
Booked for pest control and the guy didn't show up!! Highly unprofessional!! It took me 2 hours to clear the kitchen and all my utensils and stuff is in the balcony now. Even the refund would come after 5-7 working days!! This is highly disappointing and unacceptable!!
Acha hai
great work un women ke liye jinke husband ko apni job Ke karn time ni h ghr chhote chhote kamo ke liye unke liye urban company best h thanks to urban company
good salon service
Good Experience
Very good
They provide excellent service.pricy but worth it.
Great
Worst service app ever used. They ask after your schedule time to reschedule it.
Booked for aircon servicing. Got rescheduled once bcoz technician was not available. Got rescheduled another day again bcoz the other technician's machine broke down. All in all, I didn't manage to engage their service at all and I lost time bcoz of their inability to render services. Very frustrating bcoz all the bookings were cancelled last minute when i made special arrangements twice to stay home for the servicing.
Pathetic app.. never use its services. Highly unprofessional people.
Good service, good quality work, nice prices
Got deep cleansing of the bathroom. Mr Kiran did excellent job. With patience he did his job. thanks Kiran.

App Design is worst and no contact numbers of customer care to take help on services provided. Design the App properly and come to the market

Urban Company is the worst service provider in the world.....they don't even attend the service. Your call center executives are calling and speaking hopeless words. They are confirming that they can't guarantee the services but we need to wait till they come. This is how this unprofessionals work. Hopeless Business......
Your service is not at all professional. I asked for cleaners for FRIDAY MORNING on THURSDAY EVENING at 7pm, and your team had accepted the work. Unfortunately, I had to request a call back from the company to know that the cleaners have not yet been assigned and that the schedule has been canceled without even notifying me. What kind of service is this? Worst service ever. This is the third time I'm having such an experience. This is heights of unprofessionalism.
support for the app is abysmal. if the service is not as per standards then they do anything to fix it. they are supposed to be a professional company but just work like a random service engineer
When i got my very first service bad the customer service guys also didn't do their job well . Ordered a full gellish manicure and full pedicure. The lady came and just changed my polish and said this is how we do it . Even the polish was the worst i have ever seen in my life .Gellish polish peeled off next day. I paid for the premium membership and got the worst treatment üò™
worst service........... less massage in facial.I got 28 minutes massage for 500 rupees when it should be 45 minutes... don't book urban company
Good.. Keep it up..
lovely service
Very bad experince in app aa well as call centre. Very unhappy.
Worst app technician assigned changed by booking all by himself without informing me and ran away
excellent service
Painters done it well If we have any work pending they said they will complete
Good
Poor escalation team. Poorest of services rendered. Their system has gone to dogs. No difference of u call out engr from outside. They are simply sitting to harrass customers. cheaters. Technicians cheat with material used cheating could range from quality to quantity. In my case it was quantity. charged for 10 mtrs wiring which is actually not more than 5 mtrs. Upon bringing this in knowledge of so called escalation team they are simply not bothered and taking this too lightly.
High convenience offered. Thank You. The process of asking for pin etc. should be at the end of service delivery not at the begining of it.
Very good service.
UC is getting worst by the day it seems. Such pathetic experience. No number to call and no proper options on the app as well to resolve my issue. How come you keep assigning the same specialist whom I had blacklisted. I was promised she would never get assigned to me but now I seem to have no option but only go with her!!!!! Because of this pathetic and hopeless customer service I think I'll have stop using your service.
Was feeling relaxed after having a session from urbanclap
No customer care.......
Experience with professional was OK. but UC did not provide certian things for service of customer. The quality of safety kit has been of very poor quality. There is no communication chalane to talk to UC. It sems over all UC has detiorated in service as compared to earlier. I paid 288.00 instead of 258.00 . How do I recover ???
Urban company is dishonest, unreliable, trains staff to manipulate and defraud customers, do not give anything in writing, do not honor commitments, supplies inferior paint than what is selected, their sales person, contractors and suppliers are not on same page and all of them together becomes detrimental to customers interest. Complaints are not resolved amicably. They demand 100% advance and don't give anything in writing. App is maniplisted from back-end. Don't deserve any rating-0
easy to access any service needed for house repair and cleaning. professional services just a click away.
Not reliable at all, even if you book a week before no one will show up on time and the booking will get cancelled!! There are much better other reliable companies out there to serve you with professional services, if you rally want to spoil your day and have bad experience use Urban company....
good
The perfect app every must have ....Good Service
Urban company gives highly unprofessionl & below standerd painting service. Paint Stared peeling of post 20 days. The custumer supporrt is also very very slow. Concern was raised 2 weeks back still don't have resulation.
worst experience they charged for full house cleaning but they did not clean under furniture or move beds and after payment they charge extra money in cash
Really disappointed with painting services,were cancelled without prior notice.not expected from UC
Kindly remove the false claim of insurance protection from ur site as it is misleading and useless.On booking ur home cleaning service ur so called professional damaged one of my home appliance and because i was late(according to them)in registering a complaint on their site as ur customer care no.was unreachable they would not take appropriate action or provide  compensation .In the future i will be thinking twice before booking any service from this app to avoid unecessary hassles.
Excellent job üëè
partner should take 2nd shot of covishield
The services are not clearly defined(inclusions and exclusions). For cleaning services, professionals take advantage of it. Example kitchen can be covered from 3 sides, but professionals will say that only 1 side to max 2 sides will be cleaned. very unprofessional services
Good service
Bath room cleaning. Peter informed sufficient chemicals are not provided by the urban company. 14/10/21
Excellent work by the team
Good service
Horrible customer service !! I have opted for plus membership but most of the services are not available. Now they are not refunding the money , when I requested as there is no point of having membership if no service is available . Customer care response is pathetic.
awesome
Awful service
too arrogant and not interested in resolving customer issues and make their partner suffer
Cheater company, different rates are shown to different people. Don't ever buy their membership as you will end up paying more than what they discount.
Worst app, Scammer, I reffered my friend he didn't get 100rs , I also didn't get after he taken his first service, and they say that it is guaranteed üòèüòèüòè
Horrable first experience with urban clap. Waiting for service provider since 1 hour but didn't receive any call and update. Also tried to call the service agent he didn't answer call and message. Wastage of time.
Gb service
Extremely unprofessional. No timely service. Pathetic customer support system. Would not recommend to anyone.
Used to have good services earlier. Unprofessional service off late. Too costly and urban clap professionals force try to persuade you repeatedly for good ratings/reviews. No accountability for service partners for any delay/loss in service delivery. Ultimately customer would be the one who would suffer in the end.
excellant and professional work punctual great work
Services are good but very expensive.
good service, perfectüíØ
Excellent service
Bad bad bad bad bad bad experience. Booked twice but no msgs no calls .first day automatically my appointment has been cancelled..next day again ihv booked then assigned executive telling my her tub is not working..waiting for her for one and hour then called her then shes telling me I can't find your location..now a days maps are so bloody easy..she's confused..no calls from urban clap itself to coordinate.no direct contact numbers so clients can directly contact..u have to submit complaint.
you cannot contact customer care u have to wait for them to call back for any issue #we r stuck after prepaud paying UC
nice service and good response and very polite ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2nd edit:I also subscribed to your membership program. Still got scammed. 2 Simple cheap tap leak repairs costed 900 rupees total. You guys are charging way more than you should I'll stick with bro4u. Download bro4u they don't charge service fees ahead of the service and charge service fees a second time again after the service is over. Yes I may have booked just one service on the app. But I was charged twice by you guys. Gimme my 500 back.
Had a very bad experience. Hence would rate 0 star
The service is terrible
Excellent Service
The person came for cleaning was courteous and very well behaved person. He worked very efficiently. I would like to tell his to everyone. He is Mr. Amzad. He is a very nice person.
Totally amazing experience! Both me and my hubby! Ravi was polite and had a good experience of which body points to massage! The best part: so HYGENIC! AM SO TOTALLY USING UC AGAIN! PLEASE KEEP THIS QUALITY OF SERVICE THROUGHOUTüí´
their service is excellent i personally loved it hats off guys keep doing the good worküôåüèªüëçüèª
This company is very big thief
This is the first time I have been in a situation where the services were not delivered.. I had a 2 bookings on the same day.. one at 1000am...no1 turned up and after I followed up, by 1035am the call center agent informs me due to emergency leave the staff won't be coming and was rescheduled for 1300pm..again I followed up and by 1330pm I was informed the staff won't be coming this time either..this is by far the worst experience I have encountered...
Very help ful
I am fully satisfied, Praveen was extremely hardworking, and did his job to our full satisfaction
well done with cleaning
The complaint and review panel should be open even after 90 days.. I don't care of money.. but atleast give this much freedom.

awesome service

Really great app üëå easy to use.well experienced staff.all payment options available
Kitchen cleaning needs more elaborate options
Very very nice
Not at all useful, waste of money and time also
good
UC should come out with packages and chemicals to tackle kitchens doing Indian style cooking which leaves extremely greasy areas. it was too much for him. He was an extremely courteous chap.
Very unprofessional service. Its the same unprofessional locals, dressed in nice uniforms. None existant customer support.
Nice services on time
Hi,Myself urban company partner,why I am not getting jobs after 1st lockdown and my credits also deducted from my partner app, please give me clarification.
Now urban company is not maintained that standards, nd work mind workers , simply creating headaches nd problems with their workers,
Good on video call but i will observe after maintenance my filter will work properly or not.
Bakwas aap ghatiya company
very nice services
I was service my Split AC, they done good work and behavior also good.
Mr. Jitendra is excellent professionally and as human being. This is third time he has come and every time he has provided best services. Client delight...... best wishes
Unprofessional company at all they can't control and manage there booking as there cleaners . if the cleaners didn't show up they will charge you for there mistakes.

Con game of urban Co. Take money don't give service or steal things and refuse re service. Or don't come . crooked pest control chap did not do service in bedroom. did not even put gel in most places. To: UrbanClap Escalation desk i told tele caller to send somebody else and u again asked the same guy and he refuses to come now.  i will have to file a police complaint against urban company. this is the 10th time i have been cheated like this. They take money up front technician does not do ser
Maid was late so had to cancel. There was a cancellation charge for the refund. There is no option to get full refund without talking to the agent. Such a waste of time that we have to call agent who intern will keep us on hold to check with the cleaner. People get your service to save time. It seems you guys waste time. Not my mistake maid was late.
Workers need some training, made scratches all over taps and glasses
Good Job
Worst experience. They just show slot times take money but don't provide services on time. They think people are fools whom they can convince and reschedule again and again, and finally the customer will get irritated and cancel. This is just harassment and nothing else. The entire team is just making excuses and Apologies and they don't have anything to say, fake trust and fake people. They assured me three times they will provide service but neither they callback nor they have have any update.
Excellant service by UC. Service was done by knowlegeble professional with perfection.
There is no tracking our issue and no customer care number to contact , while calling techicien for repair status they r taking long time but initial they said 2-3 days it's almost a week still no response my suggestion not good service
Had booked beautician service and then beautician arrived too late and she didn't had all the products. Hence I cancelled it. And raised complaint. But no one has called yet to resolve the issue neither assigned any new beautician. Its been 3 days now.
good work
Waste
Pathetic experience with urban company, ur professionals deny for services for thier personal issues.. company should know about thier professionals before assiging services to them. U wasted my 3 days in a row and i just done with u.. will not recommend anyone for Urban company
Please start services near residential area of Surat International airport, Dumas. There are 2 gated communities with 100+ families staying. If you start services here there's a possibility of considerable increase in revenue.
Bravo
Excellent Service. Five Star class.
Professional Service...
Worst service provider. Never arranged service in time always delayed.
no service in my area,
Please introduce Body Waxing for men.
I had done intensive cleaning in my home last week. But no cleaning professional came at the time of booking and no one has any information. Then I cancelled my booking. Then I booked service for another day. You have mentioned special tools and chemicals will be used while cleaning in the add. But your professionals used basic chemicals normally available in the market for cleaning nad removal of hardwater scale stains and measuring marks onnpipe in tiles grinding works not done properly.
Amazing service massage therapist i really love it‚ò∫Ô∏è
Gud
prakash is a proffesional. had a great experience
Very bed experience
Most professional guys I've ever come across in this line of business, in the North East,
Worst services. Non professional staff, always delayed
They outsourced to other company and the cleaners were Rude and unprofessional and came without supplies even when they charged for supplies.
Very good sevicing
Customer service is pathetic or even difficult to reach
The best servicing company... Excellent service... Thank you
awesome
Worst services i have ever seen. My appointment reschedule 2 times and then cancel it. Aur add krenge ki our services is best.
Very poor service. The company decide to cancel confirm booking for no reason. Such a waste of time!!!
How to contact help center? I don't want answered questions. I want to speak and clear my doubt and there is not any option to contact help center.
Booked services but no one showed up worst app ever and no one coordinated for the same
done
Nice
Bahut ghatiya....experience Hai.. Mera.....tumlog hair katne k liye ghar p pahuch jate ho....and....kabhi bhi ek banda nahi ata....aur har banda apne tarike se...katkar jata hi.....I dislike...urban company....
Awesome
Over all good experience
very nice

Worst customer experience.. they show wrong information on app and then don't respect their orders. Wastage of time both for customers and attendants
They have lower the standards ... I had given 5 star in the past but I wish they had something lower than 1 star !!!
great
analyse perfection and behaviour before recuting
Not satisfied with their service
Very patient saved understanding staff
Best
Worst paiting service. I have registered complaint for the painting services but no one is bothered to call back
Why am I charged more for consultation after taking a subscription? I was charged Rs99 before subscription but Rs 138 after subscription. And you have a non existent grievance redressal. The customer care helpline is not accessible at all!
Worst experience. At the last moment i m receiving the message the beautician cancelled the booking . When i tried calling she is not receiving her call. Very very disappointing.
service man was asking 800 INR for same part available in 200 INR in market, and refused to fix if we will buy part from market even if we are paying for visiting charge and services charges, skip at any cost
The agents assume that the clients are fools and will not be able to undrstnd their game. I made a booking cncllation 12 days bk and on not receiving my refund I called to check with them. The agnt lied that the refnd was processed on Oct 1 itself and I shuld share my bank statmnt with them so they can cross check the refnd rvrsal. Also the first agnt promised a diff refund amnt than the 2nd agent. I am simply waiting on my res call bk which I'm sure dey will not do till the ref amnt reflects.
Nice
Good
Worst service provided by Urban Clap and no resoultion provided.. unnessarily I loose money for unprofessional cleaning.. Only advertising and attraction but reality customer is unsatisfied...
I have opted for pest control, but having 3 time pest control(spray , gel, spray) , still cockroches freely move everwhere, i wont recommend anybody to book pest control service from urbanclap.
Excellent very happy with the service
Bad service.... Appointed new beautian who are not trained properly.
The team was very quick and helpful. Overall satisfied with the services and overall experience.
In the bill Rs. 699 is for the toilet repair + taxes= 798, but the final bill was 888 because he applied MSeal, and charged 90 for MSeal. According to bill : 90 for mseal Visitation charge: 60 Please justify: Rs.888 bill Stop fooling people,, worst company ever. Please stop using this app and hire local vendor, they r far more better than these Urban Thugs.
Worst app ever Customer service is bad. Professionals don't have equipment. In name of rescheduling they cancel you booking. rates go up in the name of festivals
worst service worst and includes lots of hidden charges
Really disappointed I got painting job done by UC .They took all money as advance as compulsory and the painter left the job uncompleted and despite contacting UC . They never send the painter again.I will never buy UC membership again.
charges are very high
Worst experience faced.none of the services were good
great app and affordable services
Professional and disciplined
This is good for any service at your home parlour service I get you can get service at your home and also ate low price
Scaleability of the app is excellet.
this app makes life easy. work done easily.
excellent service,would prefer her for the next time
Edit 2: An inspection is scheduled for checking the issue for 13/10. But I am not sure whether I would have to pay the professional for this visit. Where could I confirm this? I do not want to pay anymore money for the issue. Worried especially after reading few reviews- Ruma Devi Oct 5/2021. Edit 1: One of your employees called me a few minutes back. She apologized and started talking about how I should have complained within 3 days of warranty. When I told her that I was not aware of it, she said that it was there in-app and started blaming me. How could you blame the victim so ruthlessly? On a Sunday evening when you folks are not willing to take responsibility, what is the point of further aggravating the customer? 1. Why is the service so abysmal that I have to ensure to raise a complaint within those 3 days? 2. Why is the warranty not mentioned in any of the emails after the booking is confirmed? 3. Why is warranty only mentioned once the job is finished by professionals? How would users who do not open the app after the job is complete know about this? 4. Instead of taking corrective measures and compensating me (that is the least Urban Company should do as I have to spend thousands of bucks now on both of my washrooms), you are further causing me distress via your customer executives who are directly blaming me for not reporting ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Please do not avail move in clean up done from urban company. It destroyed my property and the company did not take any steps as it was out of warranty period. I was not aware about the warranty period and raised a complain within 5 days of service. I understand that it was an oversight from me that warranty time period feature was missed. But no one can undo the damage that has been done. I have to spend thousands for the same job
charges are higher...
Very good
Very poor service...asign personal isn't attend the call. Also urban company deducted 100 rs as a cancelation policy. Hopeless service
was very much satisfied
Poor
Not serving my area
I booked my services and paid in advance before one day...but there is no response from the UC and no one turned up for services after waiting long 2 hours and cancelled my scheduled services... And paid rs 100 for nothing...bad experience
I have very bad experience with my last appointment..after waxing I have pimples and itching on all over my hands and legs.
Service was good but some service folks are asking for a great feedback. Let this not be the case. Urban company should ensure that your deployed service personnel should not ask for a great feedback rather let the customer decide and give a feedback based on the satisfaction levels after getting your services.
This is an untrustable app. If we plan and trust this services it wil gonna be flop. I have booked beautician services but they doesn't assign professional, automatically it gets cancelled without any notification and they will ask us to forcebly reschedule even if we reschedule it will show next day date and again professional will not be assigned and they will cancel. Please don't trust these app.
Third class service
Nice service
Wonderful people. Nice experience
Whom they send she was so talkative n ask me about "u eat non veg or not " I think that is not her work at all, how can she ask me like that..? And literally She was in so hurry.. The nailpaint she was used is so local remove aftr in 2nd day.... Next time don't send that kind of people for servicing.....
Cannot find my purchase history. Had paid for AMC, but after two services no one responded. No way to reach call center at all. Customer looted again after money collected
Urbanclap is Just making fool of us and making money.
Really good experience
Fantastic
Such a waste of time. Horrible experience, pathetic service and customer care doesn't even respond. This is how you run a company with fake professionals. Keep it up urban clap
good
Charged me twice firstly i paid from urban app then after giving service carpenter take away the cash amount for a simple lock change service he charged me 500
Excellent
Worst experience. They confirm your booking and won't turn up. When you call the customer service they will ask to reschedule and the slot will be after 2 days. Uninstalling.
Very bad experience. We did work with u in banglore Mahveer seasons HSR sector 2 on last sunday, the work was not up to the mark, window net they have not done because no supervision from our side as they are bachelors and I was unavailable to supervise them after 4pm (mother of one bachelors) . main one staff has taken oneplus charger wire with him which I realised when I came back 7 pm
Reg. Amount charged and shown as outstading. I was told by your customer care staff on 11 Oct that I need not pay. It was witin your three months warranty period. But it still shown as payment dues. Why?
we get all services under one roof
Professional are not trained on details like bathroom cleaning and they make excuse for not using machines for scrubing because of chances of them getting electric shock
App me kuch khamiya h jiska fayda company ke technician uthte h
I am very Happy üòä was nice urban compney
Very bad exprience
If you are fully booked at least call the customer!!!!! Worst service ever!!!!! I was waiting on my only 1 day evening off. rescheduled again, worst service,very slow, she didn't complete the task. Waste of money. Will never book again.
Chandan and team good job
Worst experience ever. They charge you twice for one service. @Urban Company - Please stop such practices. Atleast initiate refunds for the work which are not actually done. I would request never do advance payment for services. They tell you to get in touch with bank for resolving refund related issues when payment is already done to them. UC Membership is of no use. Just another way to take money from your pockets.
Worst app ....they r not accept my booking
Worst customer service. They don't have any customer service number registered and no way to address your redressals. Staff isn't vaccinated ,doesn't wear masks and there is no way to get your money back in case of poor service
UC make life very easy.
DO NOT use this company. They charged me for cleaning service and no one arrived. They tried to fix and promised me a refund to wallet but when I booked again the charged to my bank again. They basically stole money from me and keep me on the phone promising solution wasitng my time. The cleaners also say they turned up and completed job when really they never attend property and I'm still charged! Do yourself a favour and use any other company in Dubai. I gave them many opportunities to fix.
great service
Urban company is indeed very helpful for all your needs, where you are confused as to where to look for.
Very good experience
If there is tailoring Service attached with this UC service it will much more helpful
Very worst service not assigned any professional in time and rescheduled my service to next day
Worst experience.
My experience with uc is very bad, they hire untrained professionals for work they come and experiment with your appliances. As per there desire they charge for parts and replace your original working parts with cheap and sub standard parts horrible. Please keep these people away trust with brands and call the company guys for any work. These people are worth only cleaning jobs
Pathetic Service...App saying Intense cleaning includes cleaning with Machine but the cleaner comes without it. UC sheepishly says we no longer provide machine cleaning but are Charging the customer for the same by showing the video... Highly Unprofessional & Cheat Company.Guys dont make them advance payment. Pay only after the work. They are cheats & their help centre is Bogus.
Super cleaning
few of the professionals are very good where as few are extremely in a rush to finish it off .. initially I wasn't really happy but now with a few am satisfied and would definitely recommend urban and it's feasible for any person...
Satisfied. should try.üëç
They have added UC subscribtion rs.299 without any confirmation while booking the appointment. Also cancelled the same booking as they were not able to assign anyone. Post that when I asked for the refund, they didn't refund that subscription money which they themselves added while billing. I am very disappointed from their services.
Very unprofessional approach of home painting Team. Sales guys will follow till you make payment then these guys will reschedule service without coordinating internally and screw up your plan. I am feeling harassed for no fault of mine. Poor services urban company and negative ratingüôÑ.
Worst service post lockdown by the customer care and spare parts are very high priced. Shelled out a bomb from RO installation.. Best part is, when I said to the CC agent that I should not have opted for UC, the agent said "yes"!
why Rs. 49 charged for PPE kot and other things. Nobody is wearing PPE kit these days.
Worst experience ever, totally spoiled my mum's birthday
good
Worst app I used... they just force you to continue with their services even when the cook isn't coming properly.
Amazing experience... Ms. preeti gave the services and she was wonderful ... spa was very relaxing ... and overall experience was outstanding ... highly recommended
Giving my 1 star bcz there is no negative rating available. This is the four time in a week for a simple beauty service. Imagine that
very nice
awesome service...
Excellent Service üëçüëçüëç
excellent service
First booking and cleaner didn't answer for more than 40 minutes and initiated refund, application on Android is also glitching and doesn't load the chat page sometimes. After I called customer service first time somebody hanged up on me. What else to say here?
Awesome App
good service app
Best place to get all of the essential services under 1 roof. They have highly professional and experienced people and customer care is top notch. You will get service worth of every penny. App is user friendly and you don't have to worry about your safety or completion of work. Highly recommended.
Best service in salon provider
very good
Hello! I am unable to book my appointment of women home salon wars the problem I am facing I am trying to book from 3 4 days plz tell me how to book or have any problem so fix. And i want to do haircut but its coming u can choose advance haircut or firince but I don't want any of them. I am very much disappointed with ur service üò†üò† even u don't have customer care or number
Very good Professional.
Customer care number not there. Impossible to call back customer care
Do not use this app. Some technicians are demanding more charges even after paying money in the app. I had paid 300 rs extra + 420 rs paid in app.. Just to install AC switch box. This is soo bad
Awesome experience üôè
Worst service. Name going big but service deteriorating tremendously. No consumer helpline number where we can call for solution to any problem or to redress our grievance. They will give booking after 2-3 days, take payments and then at the last minute reschedule/ cancel according to their convenience. Even after repeated request no solution . Either take it or cancel the service. That's the solution they provide. At last minute when you completely rely on their service they leave u helpless.
I would like to share my experience with UC. I had booked Plumber and Carpenter services, where I had very bad experience. I had to chase up/attend 50-60 calls of UC Executives with out any crencrete solution and highly unprofessional services. Ultimately, they refunded my money in UC Wallet, which can be utilised only against next services. After such bad experiences, who is the fool to book UC services. I suggested to refund/credit the amount in my Credit card or bank A/c, but UC refused to do
Too costly
Low wages , High commission , High penalty , no safety .
This company don't have professional tie-ups.. i have faced problem 3 Times.. and this urban company does not even take any serious action on complains or their fraud service fellows... This is waste company... I have got fraud of 2500/- on 6/10/21 by this urban company ac service fellow name hyder in Hyderabad he has cheated me...
Easy to schedule the maintenance of all our household items and very cost effective
It selects wrong location address all the time and does not allow altering and fixing of correct address
I had good experience with the services till yesterday. Very unprofessional behaviour by the Car cleaning staff. Pathetic service. Below average cleaning standard. In total it was a waste of money and time.
This is after a harrowing experience with UC.I booked a painting service and they took all the money in advance promising to give you best service but please don't be fooled.We were troubled from day 1 of the service and till now we are facing issues everyday.people who they send for painting are not even trained professionals.if you raise a complaint you wait for them to call you back forever and even if they do call back they will not resolve your issue no matter what.Dont opt for UC painting!
Good
Excellent Service
Too expensive
Excellent
Bathroom cleaning service is really bad . Professional didn't clean stains and marks and tilles properly. He did just 20% of work required to be done. I don't recomend cleaning services from UC
Good
satisfactory
Mrs Rehana Begum is very professional in body massage and excellent service...I would love to repeat the service with her again
All professionals from UC are concerned about minting money from customers by hook or crook. Either its persistent request to pay directly, providing cheaper or faulty spares, charging higher value service or item than the actual used or asking for charges not there in UC rate card. Sadly UC doesnt even know not bother to check. They are just behaving like aggregators interested in new bookings. That's the sad story of a brilliant idea like UC going to dumps due to lack of customer empathy.
Very good experience !!
Where is the response of my previous comments? I think it removed or forgotten.
Why there is no simple way to contact your customer support? It's a very unprofessional service for painting job. I haired a professional for painting job, it didn't go well. Then under warranty I requested for retouching work but no proper response, I have been waiting for more then few months and still waiting.
Perfect work of experts .
very good
Very very horrible experience cleaning staff doesn't come on time and ever after giving them time they doesn't show and customer care is also hell usless
Very worst ..no proper technicians...insisit of changing heater coil they have changed compressor of my refrigerator ..no warranty for that compressor as well, my Money 10000 rs wasted,then after they are not responding ...don't go with urban ...dont waste your time
Very pathetic service I have been chasing them for last 5-6 days still no response took the washing machine part for replacement but no response till now.
I totally disagree with some comments......yes I liked their service very much
Nice experience
I cannot give zero rating. The reschedule and reschedule for ever. Worst service
Easy to use and book services.
Very nyc company
Highly DO NOT RECOMMEND! Very bad experience! Horrible service by both service provider Swiss Star AC Co. and Urban Company as well! I paid almost Dhs1000/- for my AC to be fixed and still not fulfilled. The service providers came 4 times and still not cooling! I think they even made it worse! I wanted a refund but UC have not gotten back to me even though they know we are suffering in this heat! I have called another Ac company to fix it and I am definitely making an official complaint!
Excellent
Beauticians are treated like slaves It's a company who Harrass employees cheat employees treat employees like slaves dictatorship . No proper management . Penalties of 1000 rupees for not accepting a lead more over not mentioned . They torture also They loot money from us unnecessary without valid reason Please do not join urban clap . They will treat you like slaves dont regret yourself joining urban clap. Please do not put yourself in a company who treats you like slaves. Its a fraud company
Pathetic painting services in Gurgaon sec 47 Looted me by asking advance of 30k on painting services. I scheduled painting service for my newly constructed home but this a team of cheaters, highly unprofessional. The painting supervisor (Pranav Kumar-GGN) committed something else and looted our money in the form of advance. The category manager (Darpan Dilawari) promised to deliver but not picking up calls now. It's been 1 month but no one from the team revert.
They don't have qualified vendors.
App is great
excellent
Misleading ads, the service providers are equivalent to the local unprofessional labours which can be hired much cheaper. The only good part is ,the platform so that we don't have to search at the locale and is very handy for the needy ones.For that 4 stars. It may be a bit over expectation to see people in uniform, well trained etc, but this is India and still a develping nation, so it's OK.
Good app
Technician tries to change some or the other part for raising bills and even after full payment they provide used parts.
I'm not able to login with my number, it is showing as cannot login. Try again later. I'm trying to do since yesterday.
Professionals are late... And cancel the booking at last minute .
full satisfaction
Saloon service offered to me was pathetic. And there is no contact for support.
Zero rating in actual, the company accepts booking and then fails to assign agent on time. Also after assigning an agent the agent fails to deliver service because she suddenly realizes after accepting that she doesn't have the required kit for the service and in addition to that she expects me to cancel the booking & when I deny the same she behaves very rudely and hangs up the phone on my face. This is what you get in service after you pay for the same!!
Beauticians don't come as promised, they give excuses and cancel the booking.
Need option to provide review for old jobs
nice
Very good service ‚ô•Ô∏è I am happy with the service ‚ô•Ô∏è
exce
Full of unprofessional people, very rude.damaged our property and not even paying a refund or accepting their fault
First experience was extremely disappointing. They couldn't arrange a specialist.
Very unprofessional and poor service
Poor service, fraud technician
perfect haircut, appropriate behavior...overall completely satisfied üëå
What you show in your videos is not what one gets. For example the deep cleaning shown in the videos even had the use of a machine. No such thing happens in reality. One also has to cajole the professionals a bit to do what they should do on their own. A bit disappointed.
Boss what you think deleting my comments will help you hide your company reality. You should be ashamed. You can delete my comments from google play store but you don't know that i have already taken screen shot of your response on my comments and will be posting them on various forum, i have chat from your vendor, your mails so be ready try to delete those from other forum. You cannot stop me and everyone in my family from being bad brand ambasdor for your company.
Good
Polite and satisfied service
Not even one star. Don't refund service charge on cancellation.
very good
excellent service
No customer care no available
It is fabulous.
Binta was very good at her work...massage was so relaxing...thankyou so much
Worst experience for 2nd time too , neither the professional work properly not the company respond for their mistakes . Such a worst experience that company doesn't even allow to call the customer care to complain . They call for multiple times n each n every time theirs a new person again asking for same question instead of solving our problems
Worst experience ever. They are not cleaning walls , outer surfaces of furnitures etc as mentioned in their app. Totally fake app, rude customer service. Stay away from it. I took service in Hyderabad, its absolute useless.
Worst service ever
Professional in their job
best and prompt service...thank you Urban clap
No call from company after raising complaint and there is no toll number to contact
please use perfect products, I got alot red spots on my face
good job üôã‚Äç‚ôÇüôã‚Äç‚ôÇüôã‚Äç‚ôÇüôã‚Äç‚ôÇ
Very very worst services by urban company for AC installation / uninstallation.. Due their services I need to spend extra 2500rs for gas filling which I brought 6 months ago the new one.. Better escape / avoid services from urban company especially for AC. Even I don't want to give 1 start.
You have a freeze gas service
I am not able to find the customer care number or email id.
excellent professional work. thanks
satisfaction Is up to the market. on time support. thanks
Worst experience, I booked a bathroom cleaning for this morning, first professional cancelled this morning, without any discussion with me, timing was changed to 11.30, new professional was assigned. He calls me to say that I should cancel since he has fever. You cannot contact, you can only ask for a call back. They have no control over the professionals. They want to be like UBER for professionals, they cannot be!! Please avoid, pay your local guy to do the work for you, to avoid disappointmen
Not really happy with the UC services, I beleive that they are loosing their quality service. Can I request someone from UC to contact me please
Very bad costume support ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
Awesome Experience üôÇ
this app didn't give option to contact customer care..if we have any doubts before booking service..it is very un professional..means..they are hiding details..and also.. they are naming different names for same service..it is not correct..it should be in single name. and finally... coming to my issue..I booked for three bathrooms cleaning..but for the boy who came to do service..for him it is showing as single bath room..it is very bad situation for the owner who booked service..
nice
overall My first experience with Company was Good ...
The app should be simpler to use. It took a lot of time for me to figure out that there is a minimum service value for each category. I choose service from each category and it would not let me create a booking. I had to ultimately create 2 bookings for myself.
Third class service water lickage in side All wall dirty Not clear wall and floor Worst your money and Time
worst service ever...
The plumber did unfair business and urban clap refunded the extra amount of 380/- that he had charged. They stood up for their word. Specially Thanks to Gunjan the customer care executive!
Very good service I will definitely take it on next time
very good service
Basically a company who do not provide any means to connect with their customer care unit, what kind of services we can expect from such dubious company??? They do not have any spoke person to resolve consumer's complaints and on the contrary charging heafty amount of money from the people. Completely unreliable and untrustworthy.Stay away!!
I found all in one in this app, I love this app
Service very good
I am glad that finally I got a call from urban company executive and they listened patiently to all my problems. Though my issue was not resolved completely and at last I had to clean my kitchen on my own but atleast company refunded my half amount back. I have booked many services through this company and this is the first time I got disappointed and it would not be fair if I judge this company on basis of one worst experience. so thanks for resolving my half problem.
One of my friend booked Ac service & installation from this app for me .This is the biggest sin of my life.The pathetic guys Mr Furkan & his colleague ruined our bedroom structure .They charged us 5000 and still water is leaking from the ac.I called him he told me you can do it yourself.Now they are not answering my call.Please guys don't book service guys from this app they are unprofessional & rude.If in my hand i will give 0 star.Worst service.....
Booked bathroom cleaning services twice. The first time the professional provided excellent service. The second time the booking had to be rescheduled thrice because the professional didn't arrive on time. The final one cancelled sighting the silliest of reasons. I don't find the justification as to why I signed up for the subscription program.
One of the worst service and very unprofessional team Consistently canceling the service and delayed non responding personnel are the Hall mark of urban poor service company I would like to cancel my annual subscription after a day of booking and there is no such facility to cancel in the portal. I would prefer to give less than 0 and there is no options
Avg ..most of technicians come and ask for money on one or another pretext.. most common being they aren't paid enough ... Service description is unclear .. you think of signing for a service but it turns out to be different.
Very very bad service. Bakwas 420
Poor customer care, no support post service.
Very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very nice to hair cut in this app very nice of it
Not a good service provider Apne partner ko loot rahi hai aur unka support bhi nahin karti
Urban Company does not have strict control policy over their partners coz it depends on business on them. No value for time of the customers if the partner cancels the booking. This is for regular customers. Discounts shown our misguiding. Once side communication. No customer care number provided.
Cheap service are provide and charge high amount , bad service
Plz, provide cleaning services for small area also. Like small office & studio etc.
Changing my review from five stars to one star now. Lot of issues. The app stops abruptly. Prices have been increased like anything. There are issues with their packages. Even if you order a roll on wax package, the person will arrive with a normal wax and it's so frustrating. There are much much better services by other companies and cheaper prices. No point sticking to this app anymore.
Worst company is urban company
Very professional
I am going to file a case against Urban Company for the amount of mental and also physical harrasment we have to go through because of the highly unprofessional behaviour of all the team members and professionals alloted to deliver the service.If something will happen to you by their professional there is no one to help front he Urban Company team
One of the worst online service booking company in India
excellent service
Excellent
Worst Payment Experiance...
I booked my appointment they fixed my interview but At interview time i opened app it's showing I can't joind now, they don't have proper manegment and office phone numbers also to contact and speak some responsible person.
Best services
This was the first time, I used UC and the experience was below par. Needed a bed, two wardrobes and a side table assembled from IKEA. I thought they will send atleast a couple of guys but only one guy came for all the work. Obviously took ages to complete the entire job. Secondly, much ambiguity on pricing. I was shown 2k while booking, eventually had to shell out over 6k. Was told my wardrobe was customised. Though the service person was competent, I am unlikely to recommend UC to anyone.
GREAT IN SERVICES N ON THE POCKET TOO.... HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!
Excellent Experience
I have purchased a membership and then moved to Kota from Jaipur. To my surprise they don't provide services in Kota. My membership fee got wasted
Excellent
good
They charge you money and don't give services.. they are fraud people.
Good
This app is fake not bater job
Extremely poor service. They charge much higher than the market with various add-ons. The management has taken undue advantage of Covid and look at all the mess that have caused with the beauticians. Uninstalled!
awsome
A very unhygienic and bad experience with UC.
Waste
Terrible service. They cancel my service last minute without a reason and when I request to speak to the manager, they can't even put one on the line. Highly unreliable. Book at your own risk.
Unprofessional, what a shame, so called professional handyman ditched twice. Customer care professional only kept apologising & even after 3 days they couldn't arrange a person.
‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á costumer cear ki help chaeye

Finally my damages got resolved by proper repair ...changing the rating. .thanks As.......s . keep caling daily with blank calls in the name of resolution than send msg saying unable to reach you will call next day. Spoiled my kent machine and still no resolution since last week. Review gets deleted in few days. Fraud company.

Brilliant Just Brilliant!
Worst company and technicians ..don't take any kind of service from urban company vendors....
Such an irresponsible company that I have ever seen.... booked the slot two days prior and the beauticians did not reach us to complete the service and are very much negligent that the calls were not answered and no updates from customer care when requested for a call back....
excellent service
Good
very professional and awesome service
No professional was assigned for the booking. Eventually the booking was cancelled in the last minute.
I'm bought UC Plus membership of 1year and then I availed House cleaning service but I did not get 20% discount as they are boasting about on application. On top of that I could not find any customer care number where I could call and resolve my issue/query; hmm very professional. NO TALKING, NO COMPLAINTS!
It was awesome experience, binta didi was very excellent in her work. my first experience with urban clap was awesome. thank you UC.
I booked my and my son hair cut and i was allotted 01 30pm time. You did not bother to assign person till 1 30pm. I got call back when requested thorugh your app to notice that somebody is being treated miserably. Then you told me assign at the earliest. You further asked me to cancel or postpone is to monday. Sir my whole family had to go and we wasted 3 imprtant hours on sunday because of your inefficient system. Your reliability has proved miserable and you left the costumer with no choice
Urban Company is definitely good for cleaning & disinfecting services. But horrible regarding repairing services. In both the cases involving my front loading washing machine & my Refrigerator I had to call the respective company authorised technicians to fix the problem as the technicians sent by Urban Company failed miserably.
Worst service.
awesome
the technicians discussed and worked professionally.
I was hesitant to use this app as the prices were somewhat higher... However, when I was in trouble with any problems I couldn't get solutions anywhere, I used this app. Trust me, the professionals are professionals, they GET YOUR JOB DONE. as simple as that.
Good service
very good
Waste and worst customer support.
Didn't receive code.
Worst Services as of today. Surprising no body cares to contact customer. Schedule time not provided service and later no response. Please I will never recommend any one.
I booked saloon service yesterday. 2 slots were available 5 pm and 5:30 pm. I book 5pm slot. It's 5 pm today no beautician is assigned till now. I faced this problem with sofa cleaning last year. Now facing the same issue with saloon service. I think it's time to stop using urban company. This is totally unprofessional. Now I can not even reschedule for tomorrow. Because no slots are available. Urban company thinks customers have plenty of time to waste.
Urban Company needs to buck up with the kind of service they provide. They sent a service person whose pressure jet wash just didn't work. Call centre was helpless as they didn't have an option to contact any other local person for the service. Extremely poor show ... UC you guys need a very big overhaul.. üëéüëéüëé. Not recommended to anyone...
it's very good, and safe...Good service...
Pathetic service......booked for relocating bathroom cleaning....... pathetic service guy hardly used the scrubbing machine,had to push him even for basic cleaning....and when I complained about this all to customer service guy.. ...... all he wanted us was to pay the charges and said service ho gae so pay not bothered to address the grievance et all
good service tq
Great service provider. Have skilled professional. Provide best service at door steps. Will recommend it to everyone.
Excellent and very professional service from you. I am happy and 100% satisfied. Thank you so very much :-)
Excellent chimney cleaning services.
excellent service
flexible, open and on time .
Super satisfied with services
Your effort is good but explain more about the package clearly and also give an option to help on telephone regarding choosing the different work and package option.
Ac stopped working within 2 months of Repair and urban company claims to give 90 days warranty., but they refused to give warranty to me. They charged me 3650‚Çπ for repair. Their ac techinian took my original cooling coil and replaced it with a duplicate coil and it stopped working within 2 months
Had a pathetic experience where my money got deducted from Bank but due to some gateway glitch it could not be processed by urban company! Urban company didn't even inform me (email/call /text/whatsapp) that this has happened and my service got cancelled! Now I'm waiting for my money to be refunded!!!!!!!! Be aware of such scenarios!
They accept appointments and take upfront payment. But they do not have enough professionals and 1 hour before your appointment you get to know that no service will be provided. Highly unprofessional, unpredictable and totally unreliable
excellent service...I Love urban company and their services üëåüëåüëåüëå
Excellent Service
one should must use there service for professional massage if one needs.
Awesome Service
It is my first time with urban company...I tried so many time to call my beautician for some query but she didn't pick up...vry disappointed..
I have not received cash back from Paytm...
good
Good
good services
Pathetic service , they damaged my stabilizer also, and now not even picking up the call, totally scammer they are, don't even install this garbage app
WORLD'S MOST HORRIBLE AND DISRESPECTFUL COMPANY WHO DOES NOT RESPECT THEIR CUSTOMERS AND NEVER DO THE CLEANING SERVICE ON TIME I HAVE BOOKED FOR A CLEANING SERVICE SINCE 2 WEEKS AND EVERYDAY SOMEONE CALLS ME AND SAYS RE-SCHEDULE FOR TOMORROW AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS EVERYDAY THIS COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE OPERATING I HAD TO GIVE THEM A STAR TO POST MY REVIEW WHICH THEY DO NOT EVEN DESERVE IT
Good app....n most important they maintain their quality...at all..enjoy best beauty services at home..
Great service, one suggestion to add call to chat option in the app so that if there is no service which customer in looking for example gas connection pipe change etc. customer could get option to talk to customer care
Shivani is very good.
good work and nice company
Nice
She was nicely done her job. Am satisfied
Please don't take bookings if you can't assign anyone.
very good styling and hair cut. liked it.
Very good service
Worst service offered by company legitimately saying they will make your bathroom look the same after whole 70 minutes so appropriate
Good and timely service.
Professional service üëå rendered . No personal attention required. They analyze the the issue explain us and on our consent fix it
Useless app. Payment works after 100 attempts.
awesome and hassle free service
Good
Worst company ever.. yesterday was my move in and i relyed on them to help me unpacking and cleaning the maid was supposed to arrive 11 in am and then they said she doesn't have ID so can't enter building they will send another one at 12 then no one showed up then they said at 3, around 2:40 i receive a call saying they are working to assign someone then after 3 they call and apologise they couldn't assign one they have to reschedule to tomorrow and then today was supposed to come same problem a
Just to remove TV from one wall to to fix on another wall I had to pay 1100/- which I am surprised and take such service last from UC
I got smps of RO water filter replaced , Urban company charged 699 for same..In amazon it is available for 350 only..UC products are twice expensive than same parts in market Or amazon..better order parts from amazon and get it fixed by local technician to save itself from highly inflated repair costs
I had booked a painter for texture who charged me 10k for a 3 hour work. I was okay to pay it as long as i got the finishing i expected. Unfortunately i didn't get. The whole texture wall looks messy. No one is ready to accept the mistake.
Good Service. Please have customer service number more reachable and simple from App.
high charges
very good service
Three issues: 1) Initially agent called to re-schedule the professional to clean the half cleaned washroom.Later called said, no professional available.Reason given was that the agents denied, as in fear of them penalized 2) When I requested for the reason not refund or re-schedule the professional, there was no reason provided on why not complete refund but agreed 50% refund. 3) I have paid 6months membership amount just yesterday and requested for refund as I am not confident with UC services.
Awsm

Fraud case happened with me. I used this app for the first time for ac servicing and they faked that ac need refelling. They refilled and after 10 days ac stopped colling even without running it a single day. Now the person is not attending the call. Such a fraud app and professional was also fraud.i paid 2000‚Çπ and still issue is still there . I advice Everyone to never use this application as they hire those fraud people. Mohommad Samsad is the name of the fraud person who works for Ac repair.
Very bad service.disappointment by service of carpenter.not ready to work as per our requirement.only option left with us is to cancel our order and also cancellation charges deducted without availing services.
booking ke time per company show karti hai ki agar aap membership lenge to aapko yah service free milegi aur uske bad aap koi bhi spere lenge to use per aapko 20% discount milega bad mein company ne yah matter change kar diya aur kar diya ki sirf service ke upar 20% discount. I feel company TRUSTLESS hai to soch samajh kar URBAN CLAP ke sath kam le
Horrible CHOR company..unprofessional technicians !!
Nargis is very professional and has a very good hand. Highly recommended.
The app got crashed when I did payment. The amount is deducted but then app got crashed and didn't show me details of my booked facilities. The company should improve the quality the same as it is showing in the TV ad to get the attention.
Your person came without carrying his vaccine certificate. Whereas you claim that you have taken measures for safety. Horrible experience
Not happy with the painting thing worst management no commitment no deadline they just take the Booking and give random people to work which they are not upto the mark so sorry I am.not satisfy with the people which they provide to me
Worst service and cheated big time Update / Response to UC's reply: I have sent an email and been fighting this since the time it happened. Insensitive Customer service, unfortunately.
Feeling cheated
Very bad experience with the app.
There was a time when UC delivered exceptional services. Now it seems they have taken everyone onboard even without checking their work. had a geyser installation @ my place wherein technician damaged my wall. I didn't give him rating, infact paid him the full amount and almost after 10 days he came to my house stating to change the rating that he has been banned to not provide services anymore. He continuously was arguing with me to give a 5 star rating to him. This is d way customers r treated
Very bad experience for urban Compni led nahi. Har roj 1 led aa rahi hay
Tq UC
Very good
vaccinated, humble staff.
First of all there is no customer care number...so sure that customers will have problems after your service so removed contact details from the app...wow great
Nice service
Very unprofessional behaviour from customer service. Technician doesn't arrive on time.
Horrible useless for last 3 times the professionals are rescheduling the bookings
Good work
I have booked my salon service,and on the last minute they have cancelled it...very unprofessional...
Not good Service person done incomplete work and promised to come another day, but after calling again and again he didnt come Have paid much but worked less
Disinfection work done professionally.
They don't value the time of the customer.
Absolutely pathetic and horrible service. They took 1 lakhs for paiting and 30% advance. Noone turned up. The material sent was only 50% Noone picks calls and responds for 3 days. Going legal now
Absolutely pathetic company. Never trust this company for anything. I gave them paiting project for RS 1 lakhs and despite 3 days of followup noone has come. The company is a big scam. They took 30% in advance and we paid in confidence. Taking them to consumer court. Never do any service through urban clap
good
blessing to have your services around , thank you.
Hahaha very funny. Even after 4 escalations in a row there is no progress in your service. You are making us fools and wasting our time.this is the 5th time in a row I have booked a service and there is no update nd no beautician assigned. What a pathetic custom service. And you need a membership for the services you can't provide.  Resolution means improving your customer service, not by compensating with 100 or 200 points. Who wants your points, is it really more than our time and trust.
Worst service i have booked painting consultant everytime they have rescheduled my booking and no one arrive till now..WORST SERVICE
Excellent üëåüëåüëå
There is information leakage in this urban clap. As per order, service person to come by 4 30pm. But in place some other un known person came to my home by 4pm and did waste job without satisfaction also in drunken condition and created terror with house mates and demanded 1000 instead of Rs.350. And took Rsm 400 &wentof. After wards, d actual service person called immediately after vacation of the un known person. The sequence is terrorised the ladies in home. Please be aware on such incidents.
excellent service
satisfying
Amount is taken in advance and when time comes for service, the people keep on rescheduling as per their convenience.
Very bad company and service Don't waste your time in booking services in this app. Payment get failed many time and refund will take lot of time. Once the booking is done. They won't deliver the service on time I booked 3 days back, they postponed it again and again, after 3 days also I am not getting the service done. Worst app Dont waste your time, check for local cleaner they are far better than urban company
The exploitation of the partners seems to be borderline criminal.
Very worst no customer care number plus very unprofessional person booked to give services no manner to talk after paying amt online before but doing service time asking more money n then if say no they not ready to do professional very unhygienic dirty clothes mask etc
Much needed service.Good job guysüëç
Very disappointed to learn that the YC partners are being cheated and exploited. Not sure if I want to be associated with UC anymore. Why should my UC Plus membership discount borne by Partners, and not the company?
I have booked a salon appointment atleast two days before. But at the last minute they cancle the appointment. Which is very disappointing. I'll neither book any appointment in future & nor suggest anyone to book from here. Worst experience ever üò°üò°üò°üò°
Professionals are good but Urban clap customer service is pathetic they don't bother to call back or reply on mails , after trying for so many days they would call but useless as have no knowledge about Urban clap services or ongoing promotions.
Unprofessional technician. Issue not resolved. Overpriced services and equipments. Non responsive customer care. No complaint management system. Pathetic booking management.
great service
Everything is great but I referred one of my friend and he didn't get any 100rs off.
Worst....my appointment was scheduled fr 1pm and she turned at 10pm, moreover d wax she applied was super hot üî•
Poor service, no control over professionals sent.
After lockdown the executives have become highly unprofessional...service left incomplete..and least bothered to keep up the promise to return back..slow service...moreover..did not bring equipments for pedicure..if possible I would have asked for refund back but what to do..even the company is giving just missed calls of half a second ring...instead of proper call back..
Ac service was very poor. Feeling hot than earlier
Bad experience with the urban clap... They can change time and professional any time and even without informing the customer.
india no 1 Nice service app
I took painting service from them, it was pathetic.
Overall service was very nice .shagufta is well trained and very cooperative highly recommend to others for her .amazing service
Best
Worst customer care service. Had booked room paiting for a particular date and after confirming twice a week prior, at the last moment they called saying that we don't have painters available currently and we have to reschedule it. On asking they dint even tell me when and just cut the call. Trying to call again but not responding at all. Never ever recommend them. Highly Unprofessional (un) urban company.
Worst Worst Worst
Unprofessional and worst coordination ever I have faced. My last two booking the professional didn't turn up and worst part the UC team does not know wher there professional whereabouts. Highly recommend to all to search other companies who can better service.
tum log safety charge kis baat le rahe ho , only mask k 39 rs . urban company loot macha rakhe hai
Booking, assignment and confirmation experiences are excellent. The service partner was on time, and did a very good job. However, in post service feedback some questions about partners service and behaviour are inappropriate and in fact indignifying.
I m very happy üòä
great service at our doorstep.. really happy with uc service
Great app
Worst experience they have taken my booking but not assigning any professional. No emergency help line number. Return my money
The service of Urban Company is great. But, the cleaning personel did not has his safety gloves available with him. An amount of 50 Rupees is deducted while booking for safety hygine, but the professional said he was not provided safety gloves. Please look into this for their safety.
Dont book so called professional from here, because they are highly unprofessional. Cancelled my appointment last minute and the reason was useless. No guarantee that they will come or not. I regret big time why i booked here.
These people will take booking and professional will call and tell that he had taken a private booking outside and request you to cancel the booking as he will be penalized... They will also provide booking with professional rated 2-3... This is seriously unprofessional.. call center will not be able to provide any solution and they will deduct 100 rs from your payment reimbursement for it.. pathetic service
I am changing my review based on my experience in last service delivered by urbanclap... The professional doesn't deliver the service on time.. And usually request for a different time.... And on that different time slot denied visiting.... Urbanclap doesn't care of customer and unreliable...
Great üëç
Booked for hair cutting. Excellent person and did the job very cleanly.
WORST SERVICE & Unprofessional Customer Care Team. No one arrived for my 12 PM booking today. The driver called my that they were on their way in 10 minutes but no one came so I had to cancel our booking. This is the second time in one month that we had to face the same problem. The customer care team is very unprofessional too and will not even try to help you. Also, they can't track the location of their cleaners properly. Overall, UC is a complete waste of our time and will not recommend.
They are very unprofessional.
Unprofessional technicians they even don't know to give right connections Waste of money The so called professional attended for repair of my AC is searching in youtube what the problem is?
Terrible company. They rescheduled 2 times on me and didn't come. I suggest you don't use them. Very disappointed with them. It's better to give business to some smaller companies then them.
I booked for 2AC services.. They massage me when service expired and before that I didn't get any reminder So they earn I lost at least they gv us reminder. I m very dissapointed with it
professional approach in reasonable rates
Good app. Bad customer service. Been facing a location issue for the last one year. Since I brought it to the notice of the back end team nothing has been done and I am receiving numerous calls explaining the same thing.
very good service
good
Good service, reasonable rates for 2 bathroom cleaning.
Interesting service at doorstep...
Nice experience at home
excellent service at home ,no need for going out to parlors when we can have it at our own home
Excellent service
Used to be good, its utter nonsense now. Home Painting service is a joke
very nice services,feeling relaxed
Expensive for small jobs. Need to rethink on rates....
Inspite of a professional not being assigned at the scheduled time, an amount of 299 rupees has been deducted on cancellation which is against the policy. Very poor service with no intimation.
Very Poor Service for home cleaning. Confirmed to send 4 guys but sent only 2 and full charges.
Very good service provided by Urban Company.
Good service
1 ac technician has defrauded us of 7500 Rs..by saying he has installed a new compressor which other technician from urban company itself said hasnt been installed..i have complained several times in urban company but received no help whatsover.
Hopeless services, need supervision closely otherwise your payment is waste. So poor performance. They Take OTP before they start work..there after you are "kathputli" water stain is cleaned, and many more..hope less waste of money
Booked for bathroom cleaning for 9th st 11am. The guy called me and said he cannot come because he had to pick up a friend from railway station and asked me to cancel. I canceled amd rebooked for 3 pm. That guy also called me and asked to cancel as he could not come due to rain. They have made me wait for one whole day wasting the day completely. Call centre number will not be answered. One more thing, when I booked for 11 am they charged Rs. 727 and when I booked for 3pm they charged 787
Please entry for only want do learn and make the good future in ours line so make sure your team and your company are improve and management the understood.
excellent services
Bekar hai very bed
Terrible experiences. This company does not have respect for customers time. Their solution is to offer petty cash that does not get you 1 hour or cleaning. They do not even call back to offer better solutions and this happened more than once. Disrespectful and unreliable.
No option to edit rating, after first visit the pest control guy directly asked me to give him good rating. After the few days, cockroaches increased, I called him and he said that he will come after 4 days which never happened also, he stopped responding to the calls. Now experience initial was ok however, after few days, it became negative and I do not see an option to edit it. Finally, I called your call center and I was informed that there is no option to change the rating
Excellent work keep it up
Good experience with UC no need to search the various persons, single place single search best option and preferrable.
Date - 9/10/21 Urban company should be closed. Pathetic and worst company I have come across in my life. The cleaner is not come on time and do not answer the call. Customer service person always say I am sorry or they credit 40 aed in wallet. But what the point if the cleaner is not come. I will post this feedback across the social media website.
Good job great
Professional didn't turn up for the appointment, even after rescheduling twice.
Totally disappointed with urban company this time. The customer care team has no idea of the prices or services mentioned in the application. They do not have clarity. The description in the application is not clear. You book the service basis the details you see on UC app and the professional will tell you another story and deny for the additional booked service. Then you speak to customer care team, they have least idea about the detailing and then they will tell you, this is not included mam.
I have used the service of Urban co. They seem to be deceiving clients with the brands mentioned v/s brands used. They mentioned Loreal and they are providing am unknown brand called Elysian. (You won't even find it on Google). I wonder why would they charge extra and do this for premium service. Might as well take basic package
Perfect üëåüëå
Perfect work. listened all concerns politely and done the work without any hurry.
very Happy with the services of UC as they are very professional, transparent & result oriented. Easy & flexible way of communications.
Not working as professional
It's good and easy to use. In busy life we get great support from urban company
I was booking for salon but not suitable timings available. This app gives u time according them. I thought k achha hoga agar sb kam iss app k through ho jayega. I m working women. Worst app ever i experienced. I will never install again this app
nice but customer care should be responsive .
If there is option for not giving any star,I wud hav choosen dat rather.Extremely unprofessional,I cant describe it in words.I booked my appointment on 6th oct at 3.30pm...no professional has been assigned to me till 3.21p.m.Then I thought to reschedule it and took tha time on 8th oct 3.30 pm.and Guess what again the same thing happened to me.no body was assigned.the customer service provider tried to console me by saying that they will assign sum1 within no time but they fail.
good service
excellent cleanup.. bohat hi sweet hai hetal thank u beta
Not able to book service for around 3 months that too after registering for membership.. It says no professional available for the selected dates.. and there was no option to select days.disappointed..
Sincere service.
JALAD KUMAR SAMANTA and I

Network issues Job starred around 11AM
We opted for full house cleaning for a vacant house for which we paid 5100/- rs., But utterly disappointed with the services where they didn't even cleaned few areas, and when I rated 2 star on the survey after the completion, and also I opted for 3 day warranty service, which is expired now. Even now, no one is responded. And yesterday the cleaning guy called @t 10:30pm and saying that he will come at that time 5o work, and started all rubbish, when I told him no to bother us at that late time.
You should change your company name to Fraud company. I made the booking for RO annual maintenance on 14th July but technician denied service, despite speaking to you senior customer service I have not received full refund amount till date.
WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! Do you even have a customer care number???? I have booked for a bathroom cleaning two weeks ago and canceled it within 15 mins... I got a msg that the money will be refunded within 7 working days... it's two weeks now... how do I even contact you guys....
The company behind this app exploits workers. Horrible.
The reason I have cut stars is There has to be a help center with phone or atleast chat to clarify the service before we book. Like in cleaning service, no where it is written whether they will clean walls, move the furniture for floor cleaning Otherwise, have been very happy with the company and professional sent
Pathetic AC servicing. They charge more than double of MRP for any parts. It's much better to call your own technician n get it repaired. At least you will not be robbed.
Some of the professionals are very good and ethical and at the same time some others have a bad attitude, they want to over charge by quoting additional charges.
They are not on time they late more than 20 minutes
Highly thought of app to make life simple.
It was the most horrible experience. I booked their salon services and prepaid. The professional on the day of the delivery cancelled thr booking. I was promised another booking after three days like my time is not precious at all. Then a man helped me to reschedule it to thr next day only to not get any professional assigned again for the second day. I had been trying to contact them but to no avail. The poorest customised service i have ever experienced.
Very bad experience üëéüëéüëé
Straight case of cheating..Their engineer come damaged the refrigerator taken the money ..When we call Samsung people they have written that Urban clap mechanic has damaged the same.. When we complained to Urban Clap team one escalation manager Mrunal evetytime come ...I only want mine fridge to be in original condition..
Women hair cut service is unprofessional. Booked for 8th Oct 10.30 am, last minute got a call from urban clap for rescheduling to 9th Oct at 11.30am. The professional neither called or turned up for the cut and colour service. Very disappointed as my schedule was topsy turvy because of this. No other service is like this one. But this one am really done with. Never gonna book women cut m colour from UC
professional and perfect service ,seeing good results
Absolutely pathetic service. I've used the services of Urban Company a couple of times and have been disappointed every single time. Moreover, they damaged some equipment during kitchen cleaning services, but they didn't take any action after that despite repeated complaints. I gave 1 star rating to the professional, but somehow it became 5 star after a few hours (it remained 1 star for a couple of hours after I gave the rating). They are highly unprofessional and cheats.
Worst service ever seen. They cancel/reschedule the services 5 minutes prior to the booking slot and dont even inform about it. There beautician simply cancelled the booking without calling. Why do they take the bookings when they are unable to provide the service.
life easy
good parformance
Awful, cleaners don't turn up. Even after apologising and rescheduling for the next day cleaner still didn't show. Happened 4 times now so I'm done with them.
They broke our washing machine and ac worst app they never come for revisit
On Video Consultation I was told part of my washing maching is available but technician who visited said we don't have part to fix my washing machine and even charged visiting fees.
Just dont expect timely service of anything after booking through the urban company, each time the professional complains that they are overloaded with work , so this blaim goes to the conpany itself. After giving a clear time slot the professional each time requests for a before and after time as they can't make it at that time. No professionalism, they are just running behind profits.
Very useful. Life has become much easier.
I was refered this app by my friend but no credit of referal is received by me
great service
Provides incomplete information of the booking. No link of booking vis a vis the person who will service
Service, customer support and staff üëç excellent
Satisfying
very costly...
awesome experience
Little costly
Try to provide ur services in cities closer to delhi as we live in moradabad.
good and Authentic service
Highly Disappointed. This Ac repair guys are worst, you call them for water leakage they will open some screws near Gas area and leave it open so we call them again for Gas refilling which is high an amount Service. This guy imtiyaz didn't want to sort water leakage but was insisting on Gas refilling saying it's not sufficient enough for cooling. When had to tell him, we have no complaints with cooling he literally left the Gas thing open, and now within 15 days AC is not cooling. Disgusting
Site working very poorly
CHEATERS! Don't trust and pay amount fr yearly packs. I have booked a super saver pack of haircut (9services in a year )in urban company fr Rs.1048.I cannot attach scrensht. I have completed only one haircut service on 12th JUNE "GADDAM ARAVIND" is the person . I am unable to rebook service frm my yearly premium pack as it not even available in the app. Such a stupid app with zero communication to talk with customer care. Worst app which deletes the premium pack from the app after paying.
Good
I was trying to book for a fridge cleaning service but UC plus membership got selected., Now there are no options to contact urban company... I want the subscription to be cancelled.
Good Urban Company
you are not providing various services at my location even after buying plus membership I can't get the service, Wastage of spending money in the name of plus membership kindly refund my money.
Very good gob
Good working urban Patnar, but urban company, is too much commission for partner, madly 4200& anpadh job almost 20%, many cutting
Faltu company
Excellent
Can you please bring female salon services to jamshedpur.
Very bad service
Pathetic customer service. Call back option is just show off I have never received call back anytime before any of my booking and I'm using UC from last 2 year as a plus member. Soon I will move out of UC.
highly recommended if you are looking for genuine service
Good service...I like it.
It is a fraud app please don't call them they are scammer we called them for 2 days but still no reply they told that they will come at 6th Oct then they postponed it and then they never came
Nice
Fraud urban campany
we will inform our friends.
Harassment of calls and no one is taking responsibility of any services, they are giving us false commitment only, not to suggest people to trust on service all time
Please provide service for trinitycomple,kada agarahara
Even after 1 hour i am still waiting for maid. Helpline people keep calling so that i get irritated and cancel the booking.
Worst services... Spoiled my ac... No professionalism at all...please don't book from these guys... They damage your products and then pretend to fix it...
too good, highly professional
It is worth to call Urban clap.
very professional and immaculate cleaning . the professionals were very patient during the cleaning . would strongly recommend them again .
Thanks urban clap for solving my washing machine issue..I am very happy with your service. Took a little more time but it was finally doneüëçüëç highly recommend
Now they reply asking to send an email while I already sent one received the worst response and wrong refund. Thanks for your wonderful experience second time now they cancel after confirmation. Cheers to ur pathetic service. Clap hands for yourselves
Love the app... And love the services
Good service. Improved over time.
No option to contact customer care. Would love to see a option to contact with them.
Very poor service.Engineer do not care about schedule.Also customer support very unresponsive.So My suggestion to take service from local service provider than urb√†n company
Started painting job with delay, however job was finished excellently and satisfactorily.
good
Offlate it has turned into an irresponsible company with no customer satisfaction. Nothing is done to give a proper service to the customer. Be careful of the beautician Lipshi Biswas. A completely unprofessional woman who has no commitment or value for her words. Never expected such a service even when complete payment was made in advance. I will make sure to spread the word among all my known and unknown definitely mentioning the beautician's name as well as the ineffective customer care.
Untrustworthy in the commitments
Simply super..
Very bad experience. Unprofessional people
good
very good
Everything during sofa cleaning was excellent, very professional cleaner.
Excellent service
good work
Be aware with advance payment. Specially, don't take painting work. They do not have professional and proper customer support to help in your problems. They insist you to continue with unprofessional & less caliber people which may spoil your work by investing huge amount
It is a better experience so far. But at times I had some bad experiences. All depends on the urbanclap executives and their services.
I am very disappointed for haircut service Only male members are allocated the project Scheduled twice but still no changes At last I had canceled the project for hair cut Please hire female members for hair cut especially for women Rest other services are OK.. no issues with them
Very satisfied with Bathroom cleaning services of sanjib sethi.
Very professional
Bilkul bekar company h staff ko hi Kati h
used carpentry service. It was good. Difficult to get carpenter for small jobs. urban company to the rescue
Worst. Every time I try to book for services . I get standard reply. Professional services not available in your area. What to do . Should I change my location to a place where your services is available. I received your that I try again.. I did but as always standard reply . Professional services not available in your area. üòÇ.
Have had really pathetic experience struggling with bookings
Good one to hire, did excellent work
she was so amazing thankyou trisha
Nice
work is good
superb servicer, very professional and accurate service
On 12 sep, maine pure ghar (4bedroomset)ki deep cleaning, krvai,lekin cleaning krte toh ha, per kuch kuch chord dete ha, jo ye bolte ha apne bre me,puri tarah such ni ha,paise dene se pahle, ek ek item check kare,tabi paise de,ho sake toh kuch paise rok le,jb tk puri tarah se satisfied na ho jaye,inko jane ki jaldi hoti ha,isliye request ha,ap alreat rahe
I had used it for the first time and it was a mixed feeling. The lady was good in behaviour but the service was not satisfactory. I gave five star rating just being humble but professionally, it was a 3 or less star service.
Never show up , after 4 hours ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üí©üí©üí©
Very good app
I have take bath room cleaning 599rs services...it is not worthy.. I could of clean myself instead of paying them...
Good app.
They said one rate before visit.. after visiting they are take lots of money
Worst service...very disappointing. No control by the company. Taking complete payment in advance. But no refund in case of service deficiency. Left completely at the mercy of the vendor who caused the deficiency in the first place. One of the worst consumer facing companies I've ever dealt with. Also when i went to rate the service. It was already rated 5*. Again something fishy by the company.
It seems most of the masseus doesn't have massage bed..For saloon at home theh provide one of the worst services. I booked appointment at 6pm its 6:37 pm still none is assigned and i didnt get a call back even. Agsin the same problem today reschediled yesterdays booking to yodays 2 pm, none is assigned. And there is no response ftom urban company. Worst service ever
Pathetic unprofessional service!!
Horrible experience.Had booked a Salon service on 6th October.The girl said she is having fever.Rescheduled it to the next day.Again a beautician was assigned.After seeing many negative reviews on her being late every time,I asked her to come on time.Suddenly noticed that the booking has been rescheduled on its own to 11th October evening.Then Urban clap customer care promised to return the amount along with penalty.STILL NOT RECEIVED ANY OF IT. NEVER TRUST UC specially during any festival.
very good service undoubtedly
Good Service
Best and affordable
my fast expression is good
I love their Service.... they are very professional
Massage kabh se start kar rahe ho ap
Very disappointed...unprofessional staff..if you are aware then you can take risk but if you are unaware of services you are taking they cheat you...yet not resolve my problem...I will never avail their services again and never suggested anyone to avail services..
Good service
It would have been faster and easier if I just went to the salon. App is also very slow to load.
No backups. If the professional is unable to deliver service at a desired time. The only option is for the customer to cancel the request or postpone the whole service. There should be proper resource management. You should have some backups to avoid reschedules . I don't find customer centricity here. Although I have few good experiences with earlier appointments, I am really disappointed this time. Now I have to postpone the repair. üò©
Perfect üëå üëå
Your charges for a job includes some hidden charges ,like visitation charges and personal hygiene charges. I wanted an electrician for one fan replacement and one fan installation In place of the listed charge of Rs 307 for this you wanted another Rs 100 more ,ie 33% extra. Why? This is not fair I didn't place the order.
UC is a fraud ... Donno y they r taking 100 or 49 rs for PPE , sanitizers or mask. Openly looting
Wish there was an option for zero star rating. Got home painting work booked with Urban Company. The supervisor has left the work mid-way and no resolution has been provided. Its been 5 days since I am following up and all we hear is empty promises and copy-paste answers. Would never recommend Urban Company to anyone. You lost a customer forever. In addition, I will ensure no one in my family uses Urban Company. Pathethic service with zero commitment.
Worst service ever you cannot trust this app and service people's .
price is higher
Very poor experience. Now a days they are taking bookings and last moments they cancelled and if you called, they have lots of excuses and finally after lots of argument they will assign someone who don't have any experience about the work. Its totally unprofessional.
Any big to small needs related to home cleaning and repair or be it salon i look forwad to Uc
Hello friends dont book urban company split ac services. Because of my air conditioner running good condition. But internal unit dusty so i booked ah water jet cleaning. After then coming ch05 error coming most of time. Till also showing that problems some times only working pefectly. Most of time coming ch05 error. So please carefull to choose this urban company
I had complained few days ago about the bathroom cleaner doing his job badly and below expectation and felt wastage of our hard earned money. But, even more surprising not to have received any call from UC customer care!! It appears that UC is having a casual approach towards customer satisfaction and least bothered about wastage of money of their customers.
Bo facial bhi time se kam me ki and head message bhi 15 min hona cahiye 7 min ki
Unprofessional experience
These guys will take the booking for beautician services and then cancel the last minute. This has now happened almost every time. The worst is when I do a booking it shows available time slots and then an hour before someone calls assures they will assign a professional and exactly after the time slot call and inform they are sorry for the inconvenience. Worst ever. I would rather go to a local salon for my services. Most unprofessional services.
They are the worst service provider. They will take a booking promise some one will come over and no one shows up. Especially the beautician services. Its better get the same done else where. What is the point of booking a slot when it is convenient for you then they will either cancel or not pick the booking till the last moment.
perfect
I have applied for beautician role for urban company on sep 1 2021. After paying my training fees I have completed my training within 21 september 2021. Till today I didn't get any confirmation regarding selection. till today after multiple enquiry I have not recieved any update on my appointment. Also operation team is not ready to refund the amount and worst situation I have facing right now because of over trust on urban company. They fooled me by taking my kit fees 10200/- and nt gav appoin
Excellent service by Urban company!üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
Wrost service
Worst service
The cleaner never showed up and my card still got charged. And no word from the company at all. This is the service you can expect from this company in Dubai.
Worst service
Excellent
good job done for chimney cleaning
I booked for refrigerator repair. They charged 1200 for a part replacement which can be purchased online around 250-300
Can't open the App. Always throwing errors.
Expensive for small work like installation of exsust fan and Minnor falt
very good professional by uc
Amazing experience
superb service
Yatinder Sharma is a bad service provider. He got much money for normal work. He is not good for urban company
Don't pay online/in advance. Not a trustworthy company
-10 Rating for Urban Company. Useless and Lazy Services. Get lost.
Very bad
They will call you at inappropriate time and will forcefully close your complaint tickets Worst experience There was atike when they were good,but now the urban clap team and their partners quality has gone down the drain
Excellent
Sir, yesterday repaired today once again Leakage started Request you to send plumber again as easily as possible
Waste
Worst experience. They rescheduled services thrice and still did not show up plus when I cancelled booking still not received my money back and no word from them
While trying to make the payment it is not allowing me since morning same problem persists this is not expected from Urban clap this is my first order where I am facing how can I place next order with you if this is the case thank you bye
How to delete my account???
excellent very good
very good professional services provided.
Bahut bahut bahut bahut bahut bahut bahut jyada bekar company hai yah urban company yah use mat karo aap log bad mein pachtaoge bahut hi jyada üñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñï
Why do you guys shares customer contact details to your professional they call and irritate us to change ratings
Will definetly use urban company again! Very efficient and professional! Thank you for your hard work in providing us with such good work! As asked maid was well prepared with all cleaning supplies..
good will continue
Very clean and professional services. The cleaning staff is very good. However I used the salon service for mani padi, the lady was always distracted on the phone, she put some wrong top coat, it sticks to everything and within 3 hrs of service started chipping off. So much value for money. Now I have to get it done all over again!!!!!!@@@@ I should have spent all that money on tips n toes from the beginning, big mistake.
I'm deleteing my account, What can i say, the disappointment i feel from this company üëéüèæüëéüèæ... i guess the reviews alone are enough for everyone to never come across such service like this AGAIN ,starting by how uncoordinated the service delivery timing is and unexpectedly being reached by the vendor asking for time change due to traffic, even after agreeing on the time change no show up,, after me following up they said it needs to be rescheduled, and of course customer service not helpful.
They never send their so called experts on time. Later they refuse to refund your amount as well.
Design of the app is very good. All services are professional but grooming rate is little bit higher than market. It is expected as it is a home service. Professionals are neat and clean and also sanitise their tools in front of me.
Seems some fraud business. Buying membership you were supposed to get atleast 100 discount on every service but same is charged as visitation and safety fee plus additional. So no use of buying membership.
Good
Prompt service
the service was excellent
@UrberCompany 's service is pathetic .... They have just started their business in Guwahati. I have booked my schedule prior one day before and after got the confirmation I had been waiting like a fool for approx 1 hour but no one from Urban Company has bothered to inform me that they have rescheduled my booking to an another day and when I have called them only knew about it . So, my friends if you plan for schedule time slot for getting on timing service then never trust on Urban Company
Worst experience ..don't go with this company.
Good service.
Very bad experience
Absolutely Awesome!
1 star less for not keeping any chat window, email id or phone number of customer care.
The service person without even starting told it will give 0% result
Keep up the good work
Hopeless service,no bill submitted but charged 1,870/- Spare parts are too costly.
Good
Very professional. Satisfied. Keep up the good work.
Very poor service. I booked for 6th oct, 21 at 9am, but they can't assign professional till 9.30 am, after that a customer service executive called me a reschedule it for nxt day 4pm.I do it.but today on 7th oct. They also cannot assign professional and once again they said to reschedule or cancel. This is the first time I am facing this. I always prefer urbanclap for their salon service but this time very poor service they gave. Very much disappointed.
No callback in case of issue. No contact number provided
Its a shame to even rate this application! This is a hoax service provider! They simply take bookings without checking if professionals are available or not. We booked for a wiring problem and would run out of back up in probably 2 3 hours. They never assigned an electrician. Even to contact their customer care we need to wait for 30 mins minimum(ifffff we are lucky) and then they say they have a shortage and the electrician cant come today! The Customer Care - All they know is to say Sorry!
very good
Worst app ever
I have booked deep home cleaning services But when the concern person Mr Farhad reached the site they denied to do the work One of the concern person Mr rahul call and told Mr Farhad took 20000 to clean the work
Is in prayagraj women saloon services are not yet started or what?
Extremely slow app
super üòä
Total e disgusting
Im a partner of this company as employes before i joined in compny people were very Polite i was thought great platform for job less people but its not people being saled in this company after joining when they collected your product money your value 00 just pathetic They always force for new person reference meanwhile they reduced if u dont give any reference because companyearn highly person reference then our job commission only people killing squad in this companythreatening me to blocked
Good service. Very cordial and polite.
Worest service Don't preferred Urban Company if ratecard amount is 100 service charge 100 if any one connection as given they will charge 600 Urben company is froud company
Had a great experience with UC. professional services provided on time.
I want refund for the exterior painting material . As there is no update yet. Also they are not picking up call. I already asked them to cancel ,still no update. I want to cancel the project. Also please process refund and take your material from here. Worst costumer care service.
I had a very bad experience with urban company, I have got rashes, redness, bumps and itching all over my body after waxing, very bad quality of products used, Worst service. And when complained about it to help center, they shared a coupon code for doctor consultation which is invalid, worst costumer support. Never book an appointment through urban company bad service and worst customer help. My skin and health is suffering and also I had to spend huge amount on dermatologist and medicines
Very bad
Never use this company's services. Even if the service representative has refused to provide you with service, you will be charged a cancellation fee for no fault of your own.
Pathetic service guys, who don't know how to talk to customers. First they dont even call me for an appointment at 10. Reaches my place at 12, doesn't even apologize for being late and after that AC installation should cover all parts which user has not received. Don't show a rate card for repairs. This is not a repair, this first time installation. Else raise the rate and tell us what will be reimbursed when user has the part. After that technician has the audacity to tell me talk responsibly.
My experience with home cleaning started really well but once you get into their scheduled booking you are in for surprises! *After sometime the scheduled cleaner( who you have trainer investing time& effort) never turned up * Lame excuses like car breakdown/ accident/ running late and hence some other cleaning company got assigned each time *UC went to extent of lying scheduled cleaner is on annual leaves but she wasnt. Instead she was assigned to new customers owing to her rating
good service
I'm a more than a happy & satisfied customer of UC. Looking forward to more services from them.
excellent work
They don't have customer care number only
Please Urban Company
Great service
I got SERVICES 5 AC 4 SPLIT and one window Mr Gurffan came for service In one split AC on checking it was not cooling He cane again and said Gas have to be filled again he did same But AC is still not cooling We called him again he charged Rs 250 and said every thing is fine We checked again and found that AC still not cooling at all We informed him he sent some assistant as we do not allow a unknown person We requested him to come personally he promised but did not turn up till date
This is the third time in the past year where I have experienced lack of professional conduct from the service professional. It is my mistake, inspite of their negligence and hurried-ness in trying to complete a job past three times since last year, as a result leaving a job unfinished at the end of the day, that I have still opted for Urban company service whether it is house cleaning, ac service or most recently car cleaning. I have also complained before but a revisit isnt a rectification.
Good service oriented person come and do their works hence overall good
An excellent service,one stop solution. very professional people.
Worst service, if we faced any issue in app there is no customer care number for contacting. If didn't get the service either we have to reschedule or cancel.
They promised Amazon pay cashback but I never received it and it has been more than a week now . Their help center is also very poor. Really bad experience on the app
Worst service, they cannot resolve my issue and gave me false hope that they will give same service by going to app help option while going through that , I'm not able to do it Worst experience I want you refund back
best service
Booked a cleaner a week in advance, UC took payment. 15mins before cleaner was due to arrive UC cancelled booking. Only a partial refund given. Very disappointed.
best service and time efficient
Very poor service. The service partner asked for cancellation and I was also charged cancellation fees... Very unfair
Worst service, never on time. Overhyped ads, doesn't come close in reality.
Poor Knowledge AC Service Technicians. Booked ac service, ended up sensor failure due to miss handling of technician. Another person came and replaced partial sensor, with problem still existing, UC asking me raise new request, pay and get it fixed. Don't go with the fancy app and become prey..
good time saving service for reasonable prices
We had taken bathroom cleaning service couple of days ago and we were not pleased with the service we got from the professional assigned for it. He asked us not give 4 star rating, but we gave 4 star rating despite not being happy with his work. Since that incident, we had opted for multiple services from urban company and to our surprise we were not assigned professional for any of those services. PS : We been opting services of urban company since two years.
Okay but still too costly it seems.
Can't log into urban company ap.
Best app for all the services
excellent app ever for day to day need
Very bad experience today paid full amount including tip and the professional assigned did not turn up and there is no provision of any contact with him Asking for pin share which is not provided by UC and when I cancelled the booking they simply deducted Rs 300/- from my paid amount What kind of game plan is this
The company don't have any proper technician to assign, no proper solutions and poor customer care.
excellentüëçüëèüòÜ
Nice
Urban Company is doing unethical business.I had booked a Loreal Sunsiglow facial of Rs 1299/- on 5th October.They sent the facial kit of Cheryl's cosmeceuticals which costs only Rs. 300/- and when I raised complain they are saying both are same, whereas written at the backside in very small letters is that this is being marketed by Loreal. It's clear that it is not a Loreal product, it's being marketed by Loreal. They do not want to address the issue and are keeping mum. Please be cautious.
Your person asked to cancel service and give money to hand ,he wants to directly work and take money this is not acceptable
Nikhat shaikh is good professional ...thnx urban to give best professional nd thnx for using good quality materials ...I love UC work üëç
Overall it is good but I would like to know why there isn't a cart feature in this app ??
Do no use. Data chor app .
üëé
Awesome!!
Bht hi bekar app h....
She is superb n very polite. Knows her work very well...
Satisfied with the work done
I booked my appointment today at 8:30pm...I waited so long...then 9.50pm I called my beautician and she told me to go and complain I don't care and cut the ph....now u tell me what I do...I do complain or not....I am very disappointed to this behavior...and I never booked urban service at all...and I suggest you plz teach that girl how to talk or deal a customer....üö´üö´üö´
Worst service provided by urban company they have worst refund policy .they do not have any custome care no. in case if anyone have issue you will not be able to contact them
she is very humble lady and also perfect in her job.Keep it upüëç
Used this app for first time and their service for the first time. Their service person was highly rude and arrogant. He was hardly 300mts from house and was not willing to come. After persuading, the plumber came and shockingly very very rude. I declined taking service from him and he was not willing to leave the house and my wife was alone at home. He was adament that I speak with customer care then only he will leave. Worst ever experience, not going to use their app or service ever.
excellent service
every 2 months u are increasing price
price or high
Excellent service
Unprofessional
Professional don't carry the professional tools as demonstrated in video.
good
Need to lower the price and add more discounts
Well.... I USED to think UC as a professional company....but i will give 100% credit to them for changing my perception..... never expected such unprofessional behaviour. Nevertheless, since i have already paid the complete amount, don't think there is any other option available but to endure this unprofessional behaviour.
Overall good experience.
excellent service
thnx urban clap. keep it up
For TV Uninstallation showing cost more than 250, local vendor done with 150 rupees that also on priority basis, no need to wait for slot booking, they seriously need to work on rate card what they are charging.
I booked for three bathroom platinum cleaning, Result, 1-they were not in uniform. 2-they were not equipped 3-they were carried some chemical to clean the taps 4-came with only small brushing machine 5-Did not carried any grauting machine for tiles All the three bathroom s floor not cleaned as they promised, When I booked , they promised me the person will come in with all following protocals, I spoke to Madam sakshi and complain about they are coming without Id, she said it's ok.v.Disappoin..
My home owner call uc for repairing water purifier... the person is so rude and very unprofessional... also do poor work
I couldn't find home theatre repair section here.
Superb excellent service
Job sincerely done.
excellent service and efficient in his work
Nice app getting progressive updates.
Perfect
Unprofessional chain of services
Services need to be improved.
Giving Prompt service and very reasonable with a lot of offers.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
great once more time ... Again
Everytime I do a booking it is never on time not because of professionals but because they aren't able to assign a professional .. but take money in advance
Not satisfactory
Doing fraud..I was booked service at 1pm and they assure beautician will come 05pm.. o 05 pm they call sorry we shift for tomorrow
good service from reshma very polite n calm
after get AMC No one listen complant they dont gave any helpline no. or email id
This is my worst experience ever in my life .Sameer is the most unelgible lead .people who came to clean my house has rejected my request .is this the way to work .THEY LEFT US INTHE DUSTY HOUSE .OH MY GOD . THIS IS .WORST TEAM .I don't want to give even one star in rating
nice
You guys are theives!!
good service I happy üòÅ
All services under one roof.
Called for chimney service. Mechanic said motor faulty and replacement would cost Rs 4500. Sent him out. Called Elica and found that only capacitor had failed. Cost Rs 120.
very nice, good
Though service charges are reasonable, the spares are charged at twice market rates.For example diaphragm pump charged Rs.3500/ but market rate 1800/to 2000/ only.
My friend posted a negative review which was very genuine & these guys deleted.Those review n comments. How cheap.
Need to take alot of follow up for refund still delayed
Very good service and well mannered.l would like to call her again.
very much needed in urban areas to get professional and skilled workers and technicians.
What's customer care number urban clap
charged extra 50rs for PPE kits n etc which they didnt wear for bathroom cleaning
Urban company 3rd class company hai
very good service
A fruad and heater Co after taking money they never respond for their warranty
Very useful service.... used the house cleaning, sofa cleaning, carpentry services, etc. and found it to excellent
make cancellation request before 1 hr of service for any customer so the partner will not feel bad about cancellation
Very bad company
Good
Very potential and hard working professional person.I reccomend this a very awesome app which can make our home fully clean and well furnished.
Hard to give objective feedback when it's not optional and the assigned person insists on getting feedback right after the job. For services with multiple visits, previous feedback causes friction.
Its was great..‚ù§
No option to contact service center
Good
customer care executive prompt
Nice app
Good service and well mannered staff.
Fake warranty promise .Don't fall for it .The service provider will call and deny on the service date.
Help centre to the service is very poor. It is very difficult to contact any person for your help . There is no customer care no available
very excellent and super hygiene person
excellent
pathetic app. payment faults many time at end have paid cash. took membership but hvnt got any discount at time of billing. no option in app to address this.
thanks quick and satisfied service
Pathetic service and an absolute cheats
good
Worst experience in guwahati Assam the booked my bookings 2 days before and they denied duty on present day
All problems one solution. It's urban company.
Very very worst app
No hair desser is available right now at my location that is Ichapur Nawabganj, North 24 Parganas, PIN-743144... Even though it was available few months ago...
Pathetic customer support, typical example of the rise and fall of a promising company. Repeated rescheduling and scheduling not being met promptly, no customer service empathy. Even more pathetic is there is no refund option of subscription . Now i have paid a subscription for a service which I won't use. Feel sorry to see you fail wish the company does things right.
If you want to book a full home cleaning only full payment required for checkout!! Why should I pay full before taking service? They already got huge investment from foreign investors, so now they are too hungry to cheat customer as well as their professional. Please don't ask my registered number (so called common reply from customer service). Anybody can check "only full payment required for checkout". By this way You will definitely loose more genuine customer!!
Very unprofessional service. Their workers come and always say we will do your work personally. Don't book with urbanclap and their work is unprofessional. It's my advice to all do not book anything from here
Disappointed.. Not at all upto the mark. Dont know P of professional. After complaining Uc cs,workers started work properly.. Better u ppl look for local maids to do cleaning work coz UC is not doing wonders even after charging huge amt. After struggling with these ppl to get our work done they requested me to rate them nicely so that their job wont get affected. There is no difference in essential, premium n platinum.. Platinum cleaning is basic only
Fake company hai ye ese koi bhi service na le
Ur Add to cart option is very pathetic and confusion. Whenever I change the type (Home cleaning and car cleaning) of service it automatically get empty.
super servicess..great...üòç
costly
Essential services √†t our ü§û
No customer service being provided. Only calls being made by the customer care team and no follow-up with regards to confirming that problem is solved or not. One way communication
This makes my life easier.
Earlier I had posted a negative review it seems to have disappeared I again say the same the team they sent was the worst Mr Kamal Prasad did such shoddy work my brand New kitchen cabinets are scratched so when ever I look at them I really curse the company for employing such third rate characters Even over all the cleanliness was just not there from any angle
Good one team still now, every service are special by specialists
Cooling is still not at its best
We shifted to Adani Shantigram, but now they show no option for massage. My wife using it frequently
Patheatic service. Destroyed almost all my bathroom fittings. And when esclated. It was just noted as a feedback.
They made me reschedule my booking three times in time span of 3 days....which was worst as I also took half day from my job because for my weekend booking there was no professional assigned...n even after third reschedule they cancelled my bookings s no professional available. This was the worst experience with UC never gonna book again.
Very poor UC App
UC = UN SATISFIED CUSTOMERS OR UNSATISFACTORY COMPANY.... UC was a great concept when it first started but in these lock downs, they have taken a terrible down turn. Their services are unsatisfactory, AND everything is an ADD ON! Add ons, become the Mantra of UC these days, to RIP off customer as much as they can! Their staff are no longer courteous OR well trained. Most of the Carpenters, Electricians, and even house cleaning technicians, don't know what they are doing VERY DISSAPOINTING WORK!!
Bhot hi bekar company ladkiyan itna kaam krti h pr itna bura vehwar hota h ...or bs 1% ka hi profit hojata h ...apni puri body kharab kr ke....koi urban company join na kre
excellent, But need to track technician with new technology and apps. Please look after the matter.
Excellent app, I shall buy services from UC again, recommend this product to my friends.
Selfish
No call from urban clap for our experience
Very bad üëé
Froud compani
Chor hai ek no..ki company
Bakvas company
Poor service
very good customer service and skilled professionals, will definitely recommend UC
From the time when they have introduced categories for salon, we can't select our existing professional from whom we were usually took service from. And today I selected classic for some package and she just ruined my eyebrows. I didn't get option to select even my professional. I am taking service from last 3 years. But this time it was so pathtic I have to think twice before taking this salon service again
I'm very happy and satisfied with the work done by Manikyam and his team lead by Raju and others. Very professional cleaning. All the workers are very patience. Thank you Urban Clap. i stringly recommend Urban Clab especially this team.
Extremely Good
Worst attitude ever ,unprofessional image from the service provider
Excellent Service.
very good and efficient cleaning
I am very happy with the service.
Horrible...cancelled appointment at the time they were supposed to show up. The reason, didn't anticipate to be late :D Most stupid reason I've ever heard. Avoid at any cost, waste of time.
Notbody has assigned and no call from company's side after assigning call back also and you cannot call them worst experience
The service given by 'Nisha' was excellent. I loved the service of Urban company. I am very much satisfied by 'Nisha'.
Very happy with fan cleaning service. Hassle free and professional
Is uc available for small office cleaning
Ac servicing is excellent and they maintained professional in handling
Very helpful. One stop shop for all
They cancel at last moment by giving fake message of "unable to contact you despite several attempts", neither pick up the call and even show fake location.... Their beauticians works good(if they reach) but their service and management is pathetic
Worst App, no helpline for assistance.
service was excellent. I will recommend jyoti kumari. Her work is perfect
The luxe salon services are not available again. Last month I mailed the issue and they made the necessary bug fixes. This month again it is unavailable. Customer care is worse than useless. Did not reply to my mail. Called up and whatsapped a certain Vivek, who is supposedly in charge of Luxe. Again no response. This is the festive season. Are you even aware that you are losing regulars?
Not giving your perfectly service I am not impressed and cash on delivery is not available
there is no way customer may call upon anyone. customer is at the mercy of contractor to get his work done
I have been using since 3 years , I enjoy the services especially make your own packages. I like the detailing of every service they provide. Got good & experienced person everytime I Booked. So I took the service plan, thankyou.

After an initial unpleasant handling of the matter by the support executive. I found all other aspects to be excellent. The proffessional services rendered was the best. I was totally satisfied with the great and efficient service , polite behaviour and attitude of the proffessional .

good service
she was very good at service as well as nature
sevice is excellent
Bijayraj did an excellent job, very satisfied.
Very bad they are not giving back the money for cancellations
Worst experience with painting services, don't book this service with Urban Company. Their policies are pathetic. They misguide customer and painter. They don't allow you to make any alterations in case colour shade is not suitable. Instead to finish their work they apply unsuitable colour shade without bothering your choice. WASTE of TIME, MONEY, EFFORTS, and ENERGY. GO FOR KNOWN OR LOCAL VENDORS ONLY. I would have rated them negative if I could.
Booked for AC servicing. Said no technician available but there is no response so far. How long to wait for service and repair. If unable to do please respond so we can arrange others. Not at all satisfied with ac service booking.
Very bad company
wonderful
Yes Kaleem Khan gave good suggestions
He is very punctual, dedicated, good behaviour, worked with passion, he is a very nice young person
I have book for sofa cleaning services and the staff reach the home and than he is denied the service. He is stated to give resong . This not my duties. This will I not do and so on. Very wost experience. Not satisfied with service . üòï Suredra Kumar sahu he is very bad staff for so big company
Give us details about each facial, so that we choose accordingly for our skin texture, this will help us & we can get better complexion for the service chosen
Very bed urban company.0 marks
Very poor experience they take money and do not have professionals to service, they have been rescheduling for 2 days and no confirmation yet
I had booked for deep cleaning by seeing the video but in video they shown floor cleaning by an electric brush but the cleaning worker did not use any machines to clean the bathroom he did fully manual.
Ismein kaam karne wali Pro bahut acchi Hain per yah company bahut bekar hai Kyunki Jo Pro kam Karti Hain Unse hi Commission bahut lete hain aur Humse Paisa Jyada Lete Hain bahut hi jyada gandi ho gai hai company pahle bahut acchi Thi yah company customer ki bhi sunti Thi Aur Jo beautician kam karne Aati Thi hamare pass Unki bhi sunti Thi Magar ab ine Logon ki bus Ki Nahin Hai company chalana sath mein jo beautician hamare pass Aati Hai vah Tak pareshan hai is Baat Se Kyunki Pro Ki Nahin sunti Ha
happy service
The second booking is 30% off but when I book, it shows with no discount.
Urban company chor hai
Urban company sabse 3rd class company
Worst service ever.... Uninstalling it....
I m regular with uC but this time one of the assigned one didn't ask for otp and she didn't have change so she kept 44 rs with her told me that iwll return tomorrow and it has been 1 month .not returned
They don't describe service details properly.
Worst

First 2 services were good. From then onwards whenever I book a service and wait for the service person they don't respond. It's just this for the last 3 services. I uninstalled the app instantly.
Good experience of LG washing machine, repair
Worst service from Urban Company no one is ready to listen customer concern and moreover if customer wants to connect with someone in higher authority they won't allow you people are refusing to take calls more over they blocked my number too
Pathetic service
Knowing what the customor needs , the execution perfect
Services should have more decription in booking details
Worst experience by UC...professional arrogant .....servicing not done as said by professional and was misbehaving at house...
Punctual and excellent professional service rendered.
We booked for AC repair in office and paid amount but service was refused because it's an office. But office option is there in app. After technician has visited our office, he declined to give service and a lady at the controlling centre said the office option is not showing in their system. Altogether a very bad experience and UC remains a bad managed company. Careful while booking because what they show in UC App may not locally happen/represent. Careful.
Fit to be renamed as "Urban Loot" .. Too pricey..someone come forward to start a competing company
nice service on time
very quick service
No option to contact customer care and no option to write our queries under the app. There is help center which does not have options related to my query.
very good company
Worst service ever. They could not fix my issue. Even after they gave the service issue occured again and again and new issue occured. They charged me even after revisit of professional who was not capable enough to fix in first visit. I need my refund. Professional also took money from me offline in 2nd visit and asked me to cancel the visit. Company is not having any control on their stuff. Not a genuine app.
Pathetic service, been 10 days no response or update on my washing machine repair. Customer service never calls back and there is no way to connect with customer service directly. Utterly unprofessional service.
Thankyou Urban Company
10 years
Yesterday my kitchen, refrigerator & three fans was cleaned by a person from urban company. The person who came was ok.But the way Urban company advertise it's not the same!! He had taken almost eight & half hrs.& obviously he was very tired , hence quality of work was not as expected. For this much of work how the company could send one person? They are simply cheating the customers! But it's not the same in Mumbai/ Delhi. No proper equipments were sent for deep cleaning!! Really unhappy !!
Nonsense their professional will never arrive in time .....it's really frustrating
UC IS BEST
nice app it fulfill all your requirements at home services are too good on time...
App not working now, it always hangs when i try booking a maid
Almost double hike for salon service, can understand marginal hike but this is too much
No refund show on my account even complaint 2 3 times not yet received any call from this company. Worst experience
Good
Very poor service provide by the AC technician.
Your A.C. mechanic Mr chandan pandey attended on 1dt Oct. 21. He inspected my split a.c & told me that it would cost me Rs 4000. He filled gas & told me that the a.c. would b working. He asked for Rs.3500 for gas filling. He collected Rs.2000 from me and promised to come in the evening on that day. Since the a.c. was not working, I contacted him on 4/10/21. He told me that he would come in the evening. He did not turn up. I am out of pocket for nothing. Pl do needful urgently.
Terrible experience with urban professionals. Highly unprofessional approach towards work and zero customer satisfaction. I paid for cleaning of my 2bhk flat. 5 persons were engaged in work. During work they mishandled the wooden almirah kept in my flat and broken the glass of all 3 door's and moreover broken the wooden door. When asked about the damage they denied to admit their mistake. I raised the complaint on customer care service. No revert from their side regarding compensation.
There is no customer care number available. On 3 rd October we booked pest control service but that person has sprayed that chemical every where, even on my food dabbas also which is really dangerous.
Ac service is done by urban....which is not worth even a single rupees and i paid 3500 for.....3rd class service...and there is no option to connect..
They promised me a free service but not calling me for an appointment now, worst experience being a regular customer
Our good friend!
kaleem painter
Some services are more expensive.
thanks urban company for your great service üòÄ
Worst service ever! If your a finicky home maker dont even consider calling them for their services..Extremely dissatisfied and dissapointed!
Good
Everytime the service is availed, it gets postponed or cancelled. Painting services are just gimmick. No one attends service calls for the same. Booking should be as per customer convenience but here they want us to change our time according to their availability. ..
Gud service
A very useful and convenient service app with professionalism .
services are tremendous but rates should be some low
nice but company is charging extra for safety kits like ppe kit,etc but professional are not wearing this.
Good Job
Mene 3950 rs pay kar ke A.C gas leakage service karvai thi but after 10 days still same problem, urban clab aur technician both r not pick the call, pls Dont use urban clab services,local person are better
cost was bit hight
Excellent response
Excellent service.
very good app
Recently I raised a complaint about how bad the service was.As a solution to it, I was called and asked if I want to get the same service re assigned.I agreed to it only on one condition that I don't get that particular lady again . Guess what, you guys made arrangements with the same lady.Had to cancel the complimentary booking as it was waste of energy and time!
Degrading day by day
Good experience
All good, just an increase customer care facilities is lacking. A while back I had my air conditioner serviced and the guy took some parts for repairing them. But the person did not return with the parts. We tried contacting the company regarding that, but no response was shown. With a lot of hassle, ANOTHER person did come back and attached the parts but duplicate ones, not original which did not last for a long time. Still no action was taken against that worker, not fired or anything.
Poor service provided for windows cleaning.
Good choice
If u have cash on service it will be fine
The service is the poorest, the urban company customer service is no where approachable, I lost my money after Urban clap canceled my booking, the app doesn't work, the manager who spoke to me from customer service was really unprofessional, they literally lie and search away your money, don't ever use this service they are very horrible.
while contacting with the customer care service, nobody is receiving the call
Worst experience
Very expensive packages and professional has denied the service despite paying premium charges
Pathetic support, unfaithfull consulatnt. Booked for house painting, I was promised for some color, as soon as I done payment they start asking for extra money for random reasons
Excellent
There is no issue with the items mention above. But my problem is not yet solved with the free VIDEO consultation. Further communication is not yet made.
I am happy to select the service of urban co. & recommended it to every one .
excellent work
Very pathetic Customers care service. Despite my several requests on denial of service no one called and responded
Pathetic customer service. There's no customer care number to connect. All they have is a "help center" which is of no help. You will never know the status of your service request or even if they will assign executives or not. Better go for some local vendors than waste your time and money here.
Untrained professional they don't know about tubalar wrench Tommy wrench I booked for plumer service for washbasin tap change mechanic aaya aur keh diya yahan tool nhi chal payega basin nikalna padega jabaki tubalar wrench or Tommy wrench se bina basin nikale tap install ki ja sakti thi but usse tubalar or Tommy wrench ki jankari he nhi thi so they denied to serve pathetic service
great
it's my go to place for almost each service now
Not happy with the service received..
Worst service ever never recommend to any one
Very nice par me booking nahi kar pa rahi hu
Excellent servicr
Pathetic....they declined the services last order
We had an appointment for washing machine cleaning and the guy came and dropped two cubes and charged us 400 and left. And stated that what washing machine cleaning is. No dirt was cleaned and nothing. I have to clean everything by myself. You please remove the service from your site as it was worst. üôè
nice service
Excellent
Good
They collect the money first, so to start with i booked electrician service and the guy refused to come, the app on its own rescheduled the booking for few hours later, did not care to call ask, now it will take days to get the money back and leve alone I have to start looking for another electrician. Pathetic service, another app playing with people time and money. How could they get such high ratings, very interesting.
They shows no service available in my location and when my sister checked the service available on her phone and location we updated same address but still it shows the same no service available wrost app.....!
verry nice girl
Srinivas has done a perfect job, I would strongly recommend him to all
The beautician I called was inexperienced.. Not satisfied with the service I received ‚òπÔ∏è

Wonderful experience, the person did his job thoroughly.

No option for deleting duplicate account
Perfect for me,who has a small kid,

Simply amazing. The app needs to evolve - definitely but UC itself, is a game changer. Keep up the good work.
Brilliant service...All round appreciation
Very well done, Team urban company
Good services
service man forced to give them 5 star. I think this is not a right way. Don't pressurized customer to give them 5 star.
Great
One of the worst services i ever got. The professionals are ill trained. I swear i will never take the service again. The plumber has broken my tap , the second time visit was from a different plumber , he damaged the tap further. The pathetic part is there is no customer care no. Worst app!!
I want to suggest hair keratin and smoothening treatment service to be made available for at home please for various lengths of hair?
excellent at their work
Nice job
awesome
urban clap is outstanding
awesome
Hiring useless local vendors to do all the work
great service.
Worst services ever. They rescheduled my slot without informing us.
Mene jinko booking karni chahi hu unko nahi dikha rahi he
Your application should include window and window channel cleaning too under deep home cleaning.. I'm reducing 2 stars for that. As during festival times window cleaning is much required along with other cleaning requirements around the house.
First of all I can't book a service secondary there is no customer service center where to call for any changes , if you realy want to grow keep a customer care..
Very Good
No one gets assigned once they have accepted booking!No decency of calling and informing the customer the same.Please shut the shop and go!
I go for sofa cleaning with urban company but the service is not good softness of ma stuff is gone and second most imp thing was at the time of review they are asking did professional used company products this should be mentioned before so we can keep eyes on tha lt was like we are not here to stand by them all the time. We can just trust them that they used .it was not that clean so im confused that he really used or not.so please mention these things prior
Poor Service Worst Service Technicians
Why do you charge 50 RS to customer when you are not going to provide a PPE Kit to the cleaner or your Professional. Your partner himself told that they only charge to customer for this things but never provide it to them to use.
Wht a eve today seriously I'm big fan of u #PrabhatSinghThakur area manager of Dwarka Delhi area he is a very knowledgeable professional.He spent time explaining everything in proper details & given very satisfied answers to all the questions we had.I'm looking forward to getting the work started asap I'm belongs frm hospitality & I knw very well guest customer clients r always God always I served tht pleasure to others but first time I'm having this frm U Mr.Prabhatsibghthakurüëç‚úäüí™‚ù§üôèüòäüëè‚úå
Disaster horrible experience service was booked and urban itself cancelled my booking without informing me anything... They r so unprofessional
I feel like cleaning is important
Very bad experience. Didn't get appointment for 4 days. Once I got it then the technician didn't turn up at last moment. Moreover booking amount is yet to be refunded
4-5 hrs time promised was insufficient.
Good experience
Unprofessional untrained staff
Simply cheating people I paid INR 12725 in advance for booking house painter as per UC policy. My project was called cancelled/ to be rescheduled just a few hours before the booked slot, though I had booked my slot 1 week in advance. Pathetic service as they are still not able to refund my amount. Zero professionalism!!!!!!
Dami xa ho dami heram pxi ksto hunxa
Very well trained good behaved and professional staff
Worst service ever Had called up for pest control the first visit was smooth but for second visit there was an unprofessional person who was seemed to be drunk and whenever asked for identification was making up names just for the sake of providing one we had to ask for aadhar card of his to verify. Second of all, The product which he was using was already a used one which had only 20% of the tube left for 1 bhk house. Please be very cautious while booking any kind of service from urban clap.
I booked the UC for Bathroom cleasing service and their employee has done very good job.He transformed the old stinking bathroom to new fresh clean bathroom.Specially good work for toilet seat.
She has done a good job,her service is excellent & behaviour is very polite.I want her for my next service.
Very good service.
nice
Worst worst worst app. Booked a services but their professional accepted my request and then suddenly declined. Worst app guys. Totally bakwas. Rude behavior by professional
Bakwas service First time very bad service experience
I m happy with urban company service
Worst experience in there painting services
Good service given by your AC technician Mr Ajeet
Excellent App for house related services. Good features, well trained staff and excellent custom support. Best so far.
Faaab job.... Trustworthy service üëå
I am editing my previous review. Ignore the older replies to my comments. Here is the latest review: Value for money, and at the same time, giving jobs to semi skilled people. Kudos to UC !!!
was very friendly n took grt care at work
Useless app. They charge for membership which they dont mention its is only for a year and cant be refunded. They accept booking and deny servicing and dont refund full amount. Caution !!
Horrible experience. The cleaner was assigned and after waiting for half an hour after the assigned time schedule, the company calls to tell me that the cleaner would not be able to come due to personal reason. Very unprofessional and very poor customer service. Very quick to deduct your money but Horrible in their response to your issues.
Totally worth the experience and Money .. Thank you Urban Clap for giving us the best professionals for all Services
Would rank them minus 5. Absolutely unprofessional.
Very Bad . Not expecting that from UC . They are like if you're are getting service your product will be under warranty for 3months but For that u have to stick to the same place if you're shifted from one place to another within 5km range though even your warranty will not covered . They called me and explaning like "Jis area ke technician ne service di thi wo aapke area me service nahi deta isly aapki warranty cover nai hogi" . Wow UC. Very Bad service from UC & their technician both.
Worst service , costly and no professional eticates either to customer care or service providers. Can cancel anytime with out informing and if u cancle they charge u.
Very good
Had pathetic experience today flwith urban company. I had booked bathroom cleaning services for three bathrooms for today 8.30 AM. Since it was a Sunday, UC insisted for making 100% advance payment, which I did. Kept waiting in the morning but the assigned person did not arrive. Later I came to know that my booking has been rescheduled for 3 PM today by UC without even seeking my convenience. Even at 3 PM the new assigned person did not arrive. Customer support is absolutely useless.
service doesn't get delivered on time. 1and 1/2 hour late.
Services given by Urban Company in all areas are very satisfactory and we always prefer to call them
customer service on phone is not customer centric
Good
Booking has been rescheduled by the urban team on their own will. Second day 5th time. What's the point of slot based booking if they cannot keep it. And they have demand that if we cancel the booking within 4 hours we should pay them. And they can do whatever they like. Not professional and does not recommended.
Mr Bilal Service And Behaviour Good
wonderful service üòäüòä...I am totally satisfied üëçüëçüòäüòä
This is for urban company and not the app. Totally irresponsible and pathetic services. There is nothing special about their guys, they send normal repairmen wearing their t-shirts only. Find good technicians around your area and don't get befooled by bogus companies like Urban company.
excellent service..very professional..highly recommend Sangeeta
Pathetic...charges me for premium service in facial and products used of 100 Rs...total fraud .
I booked my salon at home service twice once for Saturday and once for Sunday but both the time no executive was assigned to me, Saturday I cancelled and rescheduled it for Sunday but again I had to cancel for the same reason, if u don't have any executive then please don't show the slots available
all the time it was great service given by UC now i am loving it to use UC. affordable rates with excellent service thank you UC
Theft through Wellness pack subscription. Subscribed for wellness pack by paying 3.6K last week for 4 massage services over next 4 months. Now when i want to book next service, only option is to pay again! No mention of wellness pack amywhere. No helpline, only chatbox on which no1 responds. Guys would suggest reach out through Linkedin and twitter if similar victim of urban co. fraud
Extremely disappointed with urban company service. I had booked your deep cleaning service for 3rd oct, 2021, 5 days back. I had booked this seeing all the reviews and ad on tv. My parents are aged and required this help on sunday itself since they had travelled a long distance. STARIX agent had been assigned who neither showed up at 3 o clock or even after 1 hour or update us. On realising that we r at the verge to cancel they smartly rescheduled it for monday with another agency. Respond pls
service at doorstep, easily available but expensive
Very very very bad experience , once they received and cancelled on their own without informing , pathetic , highly unprofessional, very very very bad experience üôÅüôÅ
Bad experience ....called for ac repair but issue did not resolved and lost a huge amount ...if u are rich and okay in wasting money you can try this app.
Professionals here don't arrive on time and cancel booking 45 mins after appointment time and app says that ur request to reschedule has been accepted.
Very worst do not any work but collect the full payment waste money
Waste of greeting UC, fed up with ur service and customer care teams calls and doesn't even give solution.  I got my Telivision serviced 10 days ago and after 3 days it got repaired, after 10-15 calls to the same technician he visited and taken my televison for repair on 27th and from that to till date his number is not working. Daily I get calls from UC stating that technician number is off sir will get back to me shortly.  Is this how your communication between customer and UC employees.
Fantastic experience
Misleading package, no customer care number.
Nice n good professional
Used the mani/pedi services several times and have been satisfied each time. I hope they will offer eyebrow grooming services soon.
good service
good in salon service ..recommended...
I have taken service of two ACs and this is under warranty. We are facing same issues and booked technician but he was asking for charges and when I told this is under warranty he cancelled the visit. Company must tell their people that if it's in warranty they should not ask for charges. I hope this issue will be addressed soon
The salon services are nice, but when I try to add the services, I am unable to add further services. Wastes our time.
good service üëç
Excellent service and material use best
nice service
Santosh was very nice and polite.
u people take advance payment and ur professionals asks for more and then they leave the work unfinished, patehtic experience

The service was good
very good service
Back offfice not working , urgent call servises not availble at current time
great app, for all home and personal solutions. Very easy to use interface and brilliant service.
Absolutely no controle over technicians and non existing customer care who does not have any idea about the service their technicians offer and parts they use....UC Invests more in advertisement than customer service......Irritates in every now and then with same old advertisement in every ott platform...How come UC got 4.5 star....unthinkable
Great professional services just a click away.very happy to know about urban company. Changed the way of living for better.
I don't know about other service, my first booking was bathroom cleaning, they don't even response for service, even after attempting call they simply say please cancel , so urban company please remove bathroom cleaning service from ur portal
great service
gud work
Horrible!! The concerned person doesnt arrive at all...and no1 responds from the customer care....horrible management
superb
Excellent service ....
awesome service
super service given by bharti.. Highly recommended.üòäüëçüëå
Scheduled appointments. The tecnician/serv executive did not get assined once and once she did not turn up. No information from UC or the serv exec on not coming and delivering the service. Horrible experience both times.
Had very unprofessional experience with Urban company service. Professional was not educated properly about the package and service. He left service incomplete and started Whatever cleaning he has done that also not done properly. When we contacted customer care even their behaviour was also like they don't care about customer. Simply hold, ask to wait and told we will call back later and disconnected the call.
Good service üëç
Super Duper bad user experience. Worst service as an App. Professionals assigned keep going to the worng location after talking to the customer care and professionals themselves. Super frustrated well before service provided. Is this a part of your strategy to frustrate the customer well before service so that they are more relaxed after the service. Well, this is a live update I am still waiting for 3rd professional to reach to my right address while I write this review.
Higky overcharged service
More than 95 % of salon has below standard barbers without any quality Urbanclap surviving on few Royale barbers by increasing prices beyond limits ..
There is no customer care number.
Scheduled for 11am and the service reached by 1pm. Awesome example of India punctual system. I have ordered for massage which supposed to complete in 40mins. But they completed in 16mins . But charged full.
I had given 0 star if there would have been option for that...Service of urban company has deteriorated from time...they don't care about their customers and don't value their time..
There are no cart found , if we add one item and go to another window to select other item then first one goes off..most worst app I have ever seen..total waste of time....not even worth for one star this app..
There is no customer care number,in case you need more info on a service. Surprisingly they have provided customer no for their services in foreign countries. The plumber didn't arrive on time, neither did he bother to inform. On calling him,he said he is going to take another hour or so. As soon as I cancelled the booking,I received a call from the customer care insisting on Rescheduling it .Needed info on Sofa upholstery cleaning,but the customer care refused to answer. 1star for AC service
Fake offers.... in the notifications once you click and enter the app you will find it was a time pass just to make customers enter the app
Whoever is reading this review, please don't use this app. I was charged twice for my service and I had to literally fight with them to get my money back. Bad customer service, over charge customers. Please please don't use this service . May it's time to give chance to some new set ups offering similar kind of service's.
Very good
Very good üëç

App has bugs. Not able to book a service. App throws error, something went wrong, please try later.
It's now 3 years and I am very happy with the overall service UC provided. Value to money, on time service, dedicated team to address issues and no payment problems.
Not a professional services.... Cleaning service was cancelled just 15min before the scheduled time
Fast and top-class service by professional experts. Sougata is exceptional. Needed just 5 minutes to complete the washing machine repair. Kudos
Very Bad experience with service and professional
I'm booking one service for 3 rd october at 12 pm but professional called me and told me that he could not came before 5 pm..and also assigned manager reschedule by after 1week..but the service was much needed for me for today in bitween 10 am to 12 pm..but they could not be resolved the customer satisfaction..they only looking by higher paid customer so called exclusive customer.i'm very much frustrating with their services.
Good app
I'm giving the app 5 stars because of 3 reasons: a) it has worked seamlessly in the 2 years I have been using it, b) they have consistently incorporated feedback they ask for; I've seen the change in process checkpoints in the haircut journey, c) cleaner UI - neat categorisation of services for example- compared to other products that provide similar on-demand value (think Zomato)
Good service and cheap price on home visit cleaning washing machine
Pest control giving error , not able to book pest control. Please suggest solution.
Mr. Gopi has done the job excellently. Perfect pest control done by him meticulously in each and every corner of the area. Well done!
Nice experience üòÄ
Not even 1 star urban company deserves ...Their technician damaged my AC and I made a complaint almost 15 times and a call request 30 times but no revert... Thay are just chilling on it... Such unprofessional behaviour was never expected.. They are liars of their promises.. I keep making written complaints but get no call back from them.. They have literally made a damage of 30k for me.. their technicians speak bad language and harrass ppl because they have no quality check at worst possible app
Pretty pathetic service, dont know the value of time, booked slot at 8am and professional didn't turn up till 9:30am ruining all my day's plan. Never answers the call and customer service is there just to say sorry, will they accept sorry from me too instead of money. If you can't provide service on time better don't provide at all for the sake of all. Don't have rating below 1star, please do add 0 or below 0 as well. Will never use urban clap again and won't recommend to anyone.
Awsme App..where you get everything related to household..very impressive..Just need more offers and discount coupons ..
Why there is no category for fitness and yoga anymore?
Useless customer service Deleted old reviews and posting again as I haven't got responses even after mailing My gift card is expiring and they are not providing Pin which got lost
Very..y unprofessional. They re scheduled my salon appointment twice and finally cancelled it. Even after a month I have not received my refund though I contacted them at least 15 times.
Exploits its business partners by taking upto 70% of what we pay. This is basically unjust partnership
One of my worst experiences after paying a bomb. Will have to look for an alternative... hope u guys refund my club membership also.
Makes life easier.very good services available
Well . ... Because no compitition available I would say It's ok. I USUALLY TAKE ONLY MASSAG SERVICE. BE AUSE DATS WAT WE DONT FET ANY ANY SITE. REST ALL OTGER SERVICE ARE DAM COSTLY WITH NO OFFER DISCOUNT . ALSO I DONT UNDERSTAND EHY UC THINK NEN DON'T DO WAXING CLEANING PEDICURE THEY DON'T AHVE ANY OPTION FOR MEN . I DOUBT IF ANY COMPITITION COMES TOMORROW IN MARJET THSI COMPANY WILL SURVIVE. I HAD TO PAY 600 RUPEES TO CUT A MY STUDY TABLE LEG ( THIN LEG) . JOB OF JUST 5 MIN &600
I like the service... But the ac technicians are very professional but always try to change gas...don't know why even after 45 days
Good
Urban clap weste hai ye koi bi mate book karo
I was unhappy
Worest app worest services jst they wasting our money n time
awesome service
I didn't get cashbacks as , I got cheated by urban clap
Nice
Good
Don't take any service from the urban company because their charges are very high, better to try local person who can understand your problem as well.
Very good, sincere and efficient person
Very good experience with the company.punctual,excellent follow up and professional
lot of extra charges
awesome services
One of the worst cleaning service. I have used them a year ago and the maid who came broke the pots in my house and left. After all this mess I stopped using their service. Thought of trying their service this year and even worse the maid never turned up for the cleaning service after waiting for ages and I had to cancel the service.
Not satisfy
shade recommedation was very informative .
It's just awesome. He cleaned my kitchen very neatly. I am very much happy.
My money got cheated, took 1025 for 2service and 1 service done ans 2nd service not able to book n shows plan expired
He is excellent
service was awesome , massage is much relaxing in clean up also..
They guy was good, however the way the ads are shown with equipments..etc..not upto mark.. They didn't have equipment to reach out at the centre of window pane.. Hand didn't reach so the patch remained. .. Neither to the top of the bathroom... It should be value for money... As this can be done with our regular maids too... Need to work on it...
Unable to redeem my service voucher for second service of my Ac plan. Why have u made your App so difficult to operate. There is no option to connect with customer care. Covid doesn't mean u will stop customer care service..
He is very punctual in time he came. He is expert in service and he is gentle and polite.
lifesaver app..just love it ‚ù§
excellent and prompt
Great service application
good app
Really easy to use and seamless experience. Made getting basic services so straghtforward and transparent
They are good at befooling and luring the customer to go to upgraded versions of their services. Booked my bathroom cleaning classic, but the person told to go take the deep cleaning and WC and wash basic charges extra. In the video for classic service they show the bathroom being cleaned which was in worse condition as compared to ours. Also at checking out, they add Rs 50/- for PPE kit and vaccination, which is another way of fleecing as no one was wearing PPE and vaccination is free.
Very good app for home services. But not all are included
Worst AC repair service
Excellent service üëçüôÇwith all safety measures thank you Urban company
Excellent experience
good services
Very unprofessional. I have opt painting services. Charges are high as compared to market price. The painters stop coming at my place. They have only completed 10% of actual work however they have asked me to made full payment on first day of job. Poor paint quality. I have gone through very bad experience. I have raised multiple complaints but noone even contacted. Now I am struggling for my money back, such mental toucher. I have hired local vendor to complete the work.
Very Good cleaning
Executives have been given authority to Lie freely over the phone. There is no complaint redressal mechanism or accountability. My appointment has been rescheduled twice despite confirmation. Due to poor service, they have managed to ruin my plans for the day twice. Please make sure you do not have any other plans when you book a service. Not dependable when it comes to respecting the customers time.
They did not show for a booking, then rebooked the appointment without any consultation for when it suited them. Also more expensive than their competitors. I won't be using them again.
very good
Best service facility provided
They keep shifting service time without taking any prior consent from the customer. Pathetic service, pathetic customer care service.
Very professional and just perfect üëç
a very useful service.
Good application
Nice service
Poor quality of Wall painting with stains of putty all over.
Perfect!!!
professional perfectionists
Very bad service there is no way to contact customer service in the app, their help centre option has no section for grievances, these guys are fraud. What kind of consumer service based app doesn't have customer care ?
service cost is little high
Robbers urban clap is robbing customers by charging 2000rs 3000rs in d name of fake repair of products such a washing machine fridge ac, worst company in d Indian history
Professional and good
Good work
I think UC will lose its customers because of this pathetic application and process. Today, again third time my payment got deducted from my account but didn't get confirmation.
Very worst experience.I booked my slot at 1pm and he came by 1.45pm.Professional person directly cancelled our booking without our consent.. then he came to my place and told order has been cancelled and told reschedule the order.
Good service
excellent
I enjoy the salon service of UC at home with out going to the lounges. They are professional and deserve kudos for their great job.
Poor experince after sales service of the RO product....Recommend not to buy this product
Too costly sometimes for other services
Very nice and soothing experience
Very professional experience
Had wonderful experience
Excellent service
Worst app ever! Booked salon service and they call me 20 mins prior to the original booking time to inform that the beautician assigned is not available. Even after the representative checked in the system & rescheduled it, again they call and tell u this person is not available. I had to finally cancel and ask for a refund. Horrible customer service and so unorganised. They don't seem to know what they are doing nor their staffs are trained professionals. Should really shut down their app!
Urband clap fool their clients, they take money and leave the work unfinished. Do not maintain time they promised. Their supervisor don't have a courtesy to update the time in case of delay. And was really very rude with their clients who questions about their services. And most importantly Don't take UC service as they don't ahve refund policy neither they provide any guarantee for the service the provide.
Services are costly even after paid membership. It's best you look for some other service.
Raised complaint for chef service 4 days back but no response..very bad customer support
Good company
Awesome service
Hassle free service free at your own place at your convenience. Thankyou UC
she is very perfect and very friendly nature
Very careless about their services..
Worst service no technician arrived at booking time and also not receiving call.
Fast efficient and effective service . Technicians are experts in their field of work. Most our courteous and polite and complete the job at hand without loss of time . My experience has been good on most ocations.
You don't have branch in Belgaum.why the hell you are sending messages daily?.stop sending msg.
I booked an electrician for fan repairing from Urban company. I made the online payment before for the service. But the electrician never arrive at the spot. Such a waste of time and money. üòî
due to mis communication between service person and urban clap service is done for kitchen only not for bathroom. but i ordered for both
Very bad customer service Unprofessional people
V. Good
Very bad experience
Good. Did not notify saloon technician arrival in msms and mail
Nice App for household services
Your therapist don't come on time. 1-1:30 hr late they arriving. This is very unprofessional of you and this wil hinder your company's growth.
Great experience
Very good service.
so far so good... üòä
I have not used this service but seeing and reading the reviews instead of positive I can just see negative reviews. Getting so many negative comments is not good. I wont be using their services for sure.
Worst ever experience Not at all professional Not on time Iresponsible It's better they shut the company and look for some other work Repeatedly cancelling the orders
Ekdam bakwaas! My money deducted but this guys did not booked service and there is no customer services available to assist with.
Dear UC, regarding painting service, project was about to start 1st October and it is not started yet. There is no way to connect with customer care. Pathetic service and rude staff behaviour. Let me know if there is any service center as I didn't get any callback and there is no customer care number where I can discuss the issue.
Unable to contact customer care, there should be option to call talk with customer care. Help centre in App takes user in circles and doesn't enable calling customer support. My booking for deep cleaning was not done as the person assigned didn't have required equipment, shouldn't these be automatically taken care
Good
Excellent
Hopeless engineers from urban clap I have repaired my washing machine charged almost 9k problem is not solved again I'm calling to the same engineer so many times he is not responding he is not coming back he is ignoring the calls I never seen such a poor services any where
It takes hours to book a service.
superb app and service
I had a very bad experience with urban company today. I had booked for bathroom cleaning for 8 am today. The person alloted Mr Ramu turned up at 10 am. There was no intimation from him about the delay and after 9 am he did not even pickup his phone. The help center could not allot some one for else for the service today so I had to cancel. A very bad experience.
Great App for providing home services.
Good
ok
thank you urban company
Worst service,...our bathroom has been damaged by service people,...they r forcing us to give 5star
The worst experience with UC, we decided to paint our house through UC.Sales Executive Krishna Alluri explained and gave quotes. But actual painting day, we realized, he made false promises. We were cheated. After paying full amount in advance we didn't even get the choice of stopping the painting job in between. UC people first of all sent less material and paint, then diluted the paint, which resulted in shabby work. Painters were asking more money as UC don't pay them enough. Poor painters.
They come to my house for geyser servvice but they made gyser leak and went and no one reolvey complaint.customwr support are of no use
Really bad experience in deep cleaning an no response from company yet , dint expect such horrible experience , please do think twice before using this cleaning services
Fake
Roli gupta from varanasi. Her service is very bad..I m disappointed from her, she does not know about hair highlighs..
They charged too much...i called for plumbing work...he charged too much for the spare parts...and removed all my old parts...for duplicate parts he charged too much...how many days it will work ..i don't know...they r looting the people
Paid upfront. Technician cancelled appointment. It has been 2 weeks and haven't got the payment back. No way to raise an issue on the app. Do you care for your customers? Is there a customer care at all?
Very good service. I am very happy.
Horrible experience,even after repeated reminders to send a carpenter with a cutter random carpenter s were sent.
Totally unreliable service . Did booking twice and nobody bothered to turn up. Now I have to wait for weeks for refund on my credit card
Very very bad experience... Professional refused to deliver service twice coz my location is far from their home.... Or I should call them very unprofessional
I had experience a very unprofessional staff. Not satisfied with saloon section for women.
Editing my rating to 1 because, I already rated in play store but the app asks me to rate again which I find as stupid and frustrating. Fix the app so that it doesn't ask people to rate again when they already have
Cheater company
I have a new split AC . I have taken services multiple time for same issue even gas refilling as well. Paying again and again for same issue . Last time technican say there will be three months warranty but customer care says one month. Horrible experience.
Good Service
After sale service is misleading . I'd booked ac servicing and UC had given me guarantee for free serviceing if any problem reccur within 3 months from the date of repair . After a month, problem had occurred and I'd claimed my warranty but professional did not came neither UC call back and after that i receive a message that problem has been resolved . I have tried again then they cancel my request. They don't even call back or try to resolve my problem. Urban company is big fraud.
EXCELLENT SERVICE
very good and satisfied job
The person entrusted with the job, completed religiously.
There is absolutely no customer service call center to call on any related issues. You cannot cancel the periodic subsribtion through the app even if the address is not valid any longer.
Very good service in urban company good professional in my ikea farniture assembly Mukesh bhardiya is very good assembler
Professional services
I have booked proffional at 12pm then they called me at 12 said that they don't have availability then they shift it to 3 the to 4 and still waiting.... the bad bad bad appointments experience
Just booked a car cleaning and it's prepaid but not a assistant not assigned it's very bad experience you should improve your services
woul all the tension in my bock has disappeared thoroughly relaxing .she was very polite and cooperative. thanks üòä priyanka ji
great
They change parts unnecessarily to increase bill. Short term profit, long term loss
finding professional made easy and hasel free.
The experience is great, please start the service in areas of Kerala (Pathanamthitta-Adoor)
Not getting my issue resolved after payment.
This is just a scam
i really appreciate Urban company for their professional service. i booked for my door fixing. excellent repair service. they also clean the wood debris after their work is done. i would recommend Urban company for carpenter related bookings.
good service
Always hangs, never loads properly
Extremely poor response of customer care team for Home painting job. No call back for last 3 days after few complaints. Looks like they are struggling to asses the material required for a basic painting job. Hope to get some reaction on this review from them .
Meghan was excellent in her work and has a professional attitude that really made me feel relax.
It's good.
Not good üëé
Why Home sanitization sevices are not available for Navi mumbai?? Also there is no customer care number for contact
charge high than normal
First experience is good.
what is your service no, how I contact you
thank you so much urban company really good
Great support and Expert Servicemen
nice useful app
This happ for the 2nd time in a row that all the slots were open but no professional was assigned after accepting the booking. Even the products weren't available with any of the professionals if you guys tried to manage the booking manually. I had thought of making my mother feel special on her birthday and you guys have just ruined it. Won't ever take your services now.
After everything being systematic ..... Der is no customer care number ..... I am in real need to contact the company and ders no provision.... Very disappointing
Value for money. Excellent way to have all the beauty services clean and tidy at your door step.
Not user friendly. I have been trying to find an electrician for putting diwali lights for the last two hours, but to no avail.
Nice services provided by UC.
I have always had no complaints WITH UC cause they always send good technicians
useful and professional app and people
Good
PATHETIC.....I have been trying to get a service from last 3 days and they are not able to assign technician. Every time they say to reschedule the service.
If any issue got after service urban company won't resolve. Very very bad support and service.
I booked for a service that never turned up. Nobody from the company helped, all they could say is sorry. They promise to call back but nobody did. On the app the job looks like it's been completed and even asking for a tip for a lady that never turned up for work. You ask for a manager or the owner but still nobody calls. They even have the face to cut the phone down on you. This is how Urban Company wants to make money. Shame on you.
The person assigned refused the services mentioned I the website
Very nice and good service and also panctual service. Thank you.
Not a good experience for plumbing. Going old school is better at least for plumbing.
good
Neet and tide work by the company. Full satisfaction to us.
Technicians are not at all professional, had worst experience with their AC service. Technician name : Surya - Chennai area. Don't allow him to repair the AC. No cooling After 10days of the AC service and gas filling. He told there is a leakage I can't do anything. Urban clab technician looted 5000rs for the pathetic service. Again booked thru LG they charged only 2500 for gas filling and servicing
The app is so slow. It doesn't show bookings. And have to wait for ages to load. Sad üò•.
I am very happy with the app and the services they provide. Extremely happy for the home cleaning services done. Boys were trained well and the supervisor was confident with his team and we were glad our house is in safe hands. Thanks to all.
Unable to reach customer support
Service good, but simply charging 50 Rs extra for ppe kit and vaccination, No one wearing ppe kit but they sanitize that is normal , Vaccination is given free by government, that too only for their safety.Still because of corona urban company also cheating by these terms and getting more money from customer.
Commitment fail... No one reach on schedule date today for paint. Advance paid 5 day before... This is direct service by u.... We are very much disturb due to this From 23 sept to 30th Sept ...still one or other issue continue...all money paid in advance...nothing in my hand...very unproffessional
Excellent

I booked service from urban company for changing gasket for my refrigerator. The guy came and said he dont have gasket so he cant do it. I paid Rs. To urban company for nothing. After that i booked service in godrage company and they did that work best. Highly disappointed from you guys. I am never gonna recommend this to anyone. I have to paid twice for the service. And the worst thing is that. There is no phone number and mail id for complains. üò°
good service
Cheat company, i did mail on mail id provided. No response. Received response will call back in 60 minutes (3 days back). Guess team forgot to mention which planet he is referencing 60 min for.
Bad experience
at last im delighted by the way u have handled the situation and forced me to revise my review.i m just overwhelmed by ur gesture. very bad experience i had called them for my microwave repair there person had visited and opened the circuit board and charged exobarantly when i refused that person simply reinstalled it in such a way that it has stopped functioning only.. please beware of such thugs they r a cheat.. and u won't find any UC helpline number to call and register ur grievances.
Very professional
Don't use this app for RO at all...their service is worst. There RO professionals don't know about RO itself. My RO has been damaged and no action has been taken by Urban clap. Lost 5500/- to urban clap scam.
URBAN COMPANY has been resolving the issues as and when required.
Good
best UC at ur doorstep for those who don't get time to visit salon
Good service excellent cool
Very good experience, must try.
very good application
No proper service technicians waiting from 2days and no person was allotted to service my refrigerator. But asks how much TIP will be given to our personnel #nonsense
Excellent service,üòç
excellent
Always charge extra money...
They haven't send my refund. They told that they will send it within 5 to 7 working days, its been more than 10 working days, they haven't refunded, worst.
very polite and good at what she was doing..
They really made efforts to our home spic -and- span. They covered every nook and corner of our house and perform the task to ensure our satisfaction. Thanks a lot for good work. Keep it up.
Horrible experience after booking a project with them . they dont have any customer care number and you can do is just keep raising tickets and nobody calls you back. HIGHLY UNSKILLED WORKFORCE is employed by them at the sites who do not have the technical know how of what they are doing . There is no system of security , as professional assigned to me had a icard issued to him 2 days later he satrted working at my place and that too happened when I complained about his inefficiency.
Not having 1 booking option bad experience not good app
Great savings
excellent
Horrible service, filled with hidden costs and vague scope of work that you only find out until much later. Sometimes professionals don't land up at all after the booking is confimed. Stay away from this app.
Poor pest control services After complaining twice, no call back, no one has bothered The ac service guy before that was Shabbily dressed and tried to solicit direct business with me. Can see that now the qulaity is being compromised
Why are charging us in the name of safety charges? Govt doing the vacination work is in free. No one is wearing pipe kit now. Only we are using the mask for covid 19 situation. We give the sanitizer to your representative at the time of entry of our house. Then why are charging us in the name of safety charges. Please stop the taking money from us in the neme of safety charges.
U/C i am unhappy
Wonderful App.
Worst experience they will never assign professional and takenyour money and hold it for 7 days
Hopeless never on time but want the money on time eventhough the professional never arrives on time
Excellent
Good job
Thorough unprofessionalism and no response till now. 2 hours late and no professional have been assigned
I booked a service and a professional was assigned to me. 20mins before the service i saw my app and wow, it was rescheduled for 24hrs later without me knowing. I called the helpline (spoke to 3-4 different agents) and they could do nothing apart from what i could already do from my app. (reschedule or refund) Never ever using this app again
speed work
Terrible app. Inadequate info. No option to call for help.
Worst customer service and professionals. A technician took away the PCB board of my washing machine for repairs and has been missing since then. Been 5 days now. Even after calling him repeatedly, he doesn't answer the calls. Raised a complaint with Urban Company multiple times but they have still not provided a resolution. Complaint ID - UC0CB59D939. Looks like they stole my PCB board and ran away and UC doesn't even have the courtesy to send another technician and fix it. Bunch of thieves
Pathetic
Pathetic part is u will not find the customer care number in the app..totally dissatisfied
Your customer support is pathetic....I was happy with your services in Mumbai but in Bhopal your service quality is poor
Does not work smooth, when job needs to be rescheduled, Urban company starts hanging, looking like they intentionally make customers wait so many people would just let go and not reschedule... bad attitude.
Every time I use UC for various services like saloon, massage, aircondition service, carpenter etc.. I am happy for their prompt and proper service. I feel the charges are reasonable.
Overall OK
Hi, tried to book a service 3-4 times and everything it says no professions available for today. Is it a bug? Unable to schedule or book
Good
Bakwas hai bahut jyada rate laytay hai. Market price say just double.
Hello everyone don't believe it worst people Kachada company frauds worst experience
Professional work, neat and clean cleaning supplies. Would like to take the service again. Also great promotion üëçHighly recommend.
awesome service
Once they take money they forget you. Worst service.

Very poor experience with UC. Order not completed as per schedule.
good
I am trying from 2 days to get appointment but every time it shows professional are not available. But I get notification that professional are available now but then immediately I try to get appointment it's shows no professional available. Waste of time! Worst experience!
very nc job, excellent worker
don't use this app very expencive and charge too much charges for simple work
After giving the payment, u will not cancel the service. Very bad experience for water purifier service
Good
Very good
Not mention any clarity on package
safety fare is irritating
Don't book urbanclap..work has stopped..painters not coming and saying issue with their payment and they will not allow other painter or complete the work until payment is received by them from urbanclap. ...very poor ..no response from urban clap.. they are switching off phone Entire day work lost..no work done
An necessary 39 is Stop in every job
Third class app your charges increases after every step. Started with INR 169 N ends up INR 449.Why not show the exact amount at first time.
Good and professional services.
Had a bad experience two times with the services. Not happy at all. Hence uninstalled it from my device. 1st time I contacted them to get my house painted. Was charged a bomb and the paint barely lasted for 6months. The paint is already peeling off. It was luster paint. Second time called them for repairing my microwave and the repair guy took the touchpad with him to be fixed when he brought it back he literally used cello tape to stick it back and has made my microwave look so ugly.
good service nice nature
Very bad, very bad, very bad... I can go on writing this for ten more times.... My first time experience itself was terrible. I was so irritated with the beauticians allotted .As a customer I was not updated with right info. There's a lot of inside unethical practices going on in the company. I would never want to use it again. I had high expectations. I was ready to pay no matter how much but only at the cost of good service But of no use I had to finally cancel my bookings.
Worst experience, I scheduled my appointment at 4.30, the beautician called me to confirm after that they reschedule my appointment at 6 without even asking me and then they did not even assign beautician and did not even cancel it. Will never use this app now.
Superb work experience so far
There is no contact point or customer support for details. Just simply pay and use services irrespective of details. It could be better if provide customer service email.
Very bad experience, they always deny appointments on time, the beauticians are not professional, waste of time.
Services is good and prompt
I have kept on complaining about the professional stealing money during the service. But no one has responded on this issue . Worst responsibility from UC team
I booked pest control service, professional didn't came, and now urban company is not even calling back to address the issue. What bad service is it!!!!
nice superb
Good
Worst experience
There's no customer complaints or service number . They took the cooks money 10k and no service provided. Really horrible experience.
well managed
too costly
Enjoyed the massage service. Thanks urban clap for hassle free services
Super
They send professional people
Highly recommend
Mahipal is very polite and did the work very neatly.
Cheated by Electrician who visited me..he took my old light without my permission and he owes me money as well...couldn't contact him or Urban as job was closed...no customer care so I am robbed....disgusting
Need to add few more services and make it cost effective
Experiencing worst service with no proper customer support
The money deducted from my account is still not refunded nor services provided and nor have I received a call to resolve the issue
Please add Henna art service also in women's.
very good service on go.. thanks
excellent service

Very very much satisfied
I am not interested
Easy and very good app
Excellent service from Mr. Roshan

Very poor service
Fine services and reasonable price
Bit Expensive

I had paid for service of refrigerator repair. Neither did the guy turned up,nor did the company refund the money. Very dissapointing
good
Always sey update your app when I try to apply cred offer, while app is already updated
Awesome
For somebody who likes to have perfect services and expects transparency. I have used them for AC and Washing Machine repair. They were fantastic.
I am fully satisfied idea of services to satisfied customer needs Thanks..
Most useless service. Unprofessional people employed. Took our electronic part 2 weeks ago. So far no word from company. Sheer harassment....and they expect payment also at the end of it. Can't give zero so one star
Not covering entire chennai... No services at kelambakkam... Atleast could've been exten upto omr padur, there are lot of gated communities there.
excellent service , 100/100
Don't feel like even giving one star. No option of selecting a professional coming at our house. Everything is auto assigned. I can't even cancel the professional assigned to me, who is partially vaccinated - if I do so, penalty charges of Rs 50 is deducted. It would be useful if they provide list of fully vaccinated professionals while booking for a service. Utter waste of time. We should not even fall for their marketing gimmick of UC plus membership. Highly disappointed
Keeps hanging up. Only assistance I hot was to uninstall and install app. Also cleaners continuously cancel
Professional approach by helper, service recommend for all
ONE STOP ONLINE SERVICE
Yes Urban Clap Good üëç
Just triking people to get more money. I selected move in deep clean, but they didn't used any machine to clean. Just did a hand clean and scars re-appeared after drying. I gave been cheated and My reason not listed in help section.
very good and on time service
Fools customer and take away customer hard earned money
Excellent work üëç
The one negative thing I felt is that the ratings that I give to professional is shared with them. I get calls from them asking me to give then 5 star rating. The ratings given should be kept confidential
Very poor service I book plumber but plumber will delay in my service 5 days left but not provide service
Extremely pathetic service. I booked for a plumber and he calls and then says please amam don't cancel the service I will come.tomorrow and he never comes and when I rescheduled the same reason is given another plumber. So when I raised tve complaint the customer service person said that he will personally see that this project of mine will be done and completed but still the story remains tbe same. Very pathetic and worst servie please don't use Urban Clap
My ac gas filled experience is pathetic... your professional is very unprofessional...no manner..very bad behaviour...irfan Haider has done my work...but he destroy my split AC...and there is no customer service..no complaint response...I want my money back
nice service. great work
Worst experience. They charged after the service at my home and then they also debited from my Card after two days. It's like now 10days we are following up for the payment yet not recieved. Such unprofessionalism attitude of Urban Clap ME. Hate it!!
Very bad service. No customer support!
Best
super worker ....I will prefer this guy..
Very quick, prompt, professional and satisfactory service.
Booked painting service through them very pathetic service...labourers were not professional ...post cleaning was not done
Urban company people are cheaters...I booked a bathroom cleaning service. They say shine will last for 2 months....but it's gone in less then two months.....and now when I checked in my app my so called 2 day warranty period is over....such a cheater you guys are !!!!
Very timely and professional services
Unable to make payment and contact customer service
Most importantly fast and reliable service with warranty period that is the added advantage, thank you UC team
Many partners in urban company are cheaters and fraud, UC supporters are tagged as "PROFESSIONAL" is not the appropriate for them
The delivery of painting material was incomplete, masking sheet was left and it has been one and a half day yet it is not delivered. Complaint raised nothing happens. Very pathetic.
Maine apki company ko paisee paye kiye par aapki company abhi thk koi call msg nhi aaya hai 1month se jadaho gya hai paise diye aapki company ke log paise khane khakaam kar rahe hai Poonam bharatwaj ne mera registration karya tha par ab unhe block kar diya hai what's aap or call msg se to aap he btau aap hum kis se bole
Even after sending an email to resolve@urbancompany, it's been weeks and issue has still not been resolved. You deserve this rating!
worst service..pls do not recommend to any one...for replacement collected huge amount..no work done.when complaint are raised..no one take owner ship and action taken...raised mutiple request...no customer care team called...taken rs 9500..no help provided
Great app and very helpful
worst
Unparalleled services rendered, thank you team UC
Not satisfied 1 bathroom was done well second bathroom was not at all dn.
Refrigerator repair experience was very good one, but fan repair experience was like a cheat. Rate card didn't mean anything for the later, straight double billing was attempted, I had to refuse the service
I would have give zero but one star is minimu so. Better opt for salon in end of the street they are far more professional than urbanclap
Changing reviews to 1 star. Had taken pest control services which had 90 days warranty. When I claimed it they confirmed visit of professional who did not arrived as per schedule. When I contacted the person through app he is saying he left job so will not come. Really unprofessional from this company who does not keep track of who is working or working not. And there is no helpline number also. Simply wait for their response after writing messages. Complete waste of time..
Good service
Upgrading to 5 star. They listen and follow up with customers to resolve the issue. Although it took one week but glad atlast it resolved.
Excellent
Pathetic experience
What a company!!! We are new to Chennai and had an AC problem. UC sent a wonderful technician and the work was very professional.
Very very bad services..we paid money for painting which was suppose to be start on 25th September..no one turn till now..no one is picking phone..the person who came to visit for inspection is Ayushman he is not picking my phone.. pathetic services..plzz help me..I paid 35%amount ,:(
Experience with the app is not great. When you receive the notification, once you click on the notification, it doesn't take you to that particular pop-up. The details about the ongoing offers are not visible. It is just the slider which shows you the offers, that too, not clearly which one is applicable to you. Plus, the customer care number is not available in the app. You can't reach out to the customer care directly to clarify any of the queries you might have.
The sad part is ... A good hair oiling plus head massage combination which is the most basic treatmemt named the Indian'champi' is missing from the product offerings of urban company. They only offer a 10 mins head massage. 10 mins seriously Very disappointing !
I booked for RO repair.. the water was leaking. He put some part in that and said that atleast it will not stop working for 3 months. After 1 week the issue started and we called the same person again also . But he denied to come and said that raise the issue on UC. Because of emergency we went to my hometown and by the time I came back , UC app was not accepting the complaint for the same so reviewing here
No one come with ppe kit and handglovez tin today date in ahmedabad sgill they are taking 99 safety charge for every visit.. Worst service provider
Please extend your Services in more areas in India...
After subscription and being member now they are not providing service from register number for my location but when I check from another number service is available for same location üòÄ.
My ac is dead now, as per technician, it will be worked properly after some days, wrost service n 100% loss
useful
Very nice , makes my life easier. Any service any time you can get . One issue only , if you have credit balance money with them it will be only for limited time then it will be removed. Overall, I'm enjoying it
Wasted my whole day
Ghatiya uc
The founder of company ID should be blocked.... Because of company review rating very very very low....
Awesome cleaning ning and excellent behaviour
I have availed the a.c service from urban clap when my a.c stopped cooling. In the same season this is the third time my a.c stopped cooling after urban clap repaired my a.c. what a service. I have seen previous ratings. Many have given 1 rating, still the rating of urban clap on play store is 4.6. I think urban clap pays Google for improving the ratings.
Very poor experience not suggested for beauty and grooming services
Very bad experience
Owsmm app
Not upto the mark. Don't stick to booked schedule. Even rescheduling is done as per UC choice.
Not worth
Very useful
No option for customer care
best Service
very nice service
Good experience with UC. Would definitely recommend.
good app to get the right technician
Nice
Absolutely professional.
Personal left the RO service job incompleted and Rajendra Singh misbehaved as local dada. No apology came. No other professionals come to complete job. Now I have to go Consumer forum for my loss as no professional came. Useless complaint committee.Now matter is under my police brother
Good service.. but not perfect mackup artist's.. too bad for UC.. improve more experts..
This company is fraud company
My friend join uc partener company but uska process 4th step tk complite hua h 5th step ko 1 month ho gya h abhi tk complete nhi hua
Refrigerator repair services are horrible
Two of service providers cancelled appointment without notice like we don't have any work to do rather than waiting of them.
Have great professionals who really add value to your home.
Very unprofessional service by your professional. Didn't solve my issue. Wasted my money and time as well. Very hectic first impression.
For last two times v poor services ..they don't have beauticians to appoint.
did a very good job. all the bathrooms r looking new.
There professionals are inexperienced. Multiple times they have disappointed me. Cuts during threading, peeling of skin during wax. They are arrogant .they fight . They backanswer . This is not at all acceptable. .please train your professionals.especially Radhika dalvi.
Extremely unprofessional behaviour. They have no proper professional who arrive on time. The support team is a big scam. They give all fake promises. Never opt for urban company services.
They loot money üí∞ they hide costs by confusing users and deeply embedding costs within the app so a common user will expect some bill but they will be charged 3-4 times more than that... Vendors also exploit your unawareness. Wish I could give -5
excellent
Excellent service
professional and timely service
Worst service booked and the person told me to reschedule the time reschedule the time and the 2nd person also told me again to reschedule again so I canceled the booking for which 100 rs loss to me worst service.
Service quality need improvement ...Techinal skill also to be improved ..not had a great experience of getting plumbing work done at home.
Everytime I try to book them... The booking is rescheduled to the next day... That is not how things work... You should respect and value time of others .. pathetic experience so far! No compensation given! It's better to go to a nearby parlour which is more reliable and deliver services in time!
For one service 2 professional came at different confimed time but both of guys said they won't be able to perform the service. after 2 guy returned my service was rescheduled and that time I was not able to take the service. I was contacted by rescheduled guy and I told him I won't be able to take the service.so he asked me to cancel the service and when I cancelled Rs.100 was deducted from my amount paid. I request urban company people to please refund my membership and service amount paid.
Professionals for cleaning never available
Very bad management
Scam! The user experience is terrible ... No way of cancelling scheduled appointments... Do not use this app!
üëç
nice service
Pathetic service.. so called professional denied service.. asked to cancel the booking.. when I attempted to cancel the booking..they are charging me cancellation fees. No means to contact customer service. Very disappointed.
Very bad experience, their issues also deducted charges high
Cant contact customer care
Good service
Last service I used for my washing machine. I was orally informed cost of the parts before replacement. After work was done, I asked for invoice, the technician denied and closed the request mentioning as "adjusted amount". Adjusted for what? The technician and his branch office decided to remove the new parts and went puting old parts all because I asked for bill. Once dispute is over I will uninstall the app. The rate card as per UC and technician are way different. UC is yet to update me.
Worst customer service. Though u raised complaint and explain one person next u wil get calls asking for issues from at least q5 people and they won't solve the issue
good to have you people
Unprofessional customer service, delayed project work, no solutions for customers query, I will never recommend anyone to take services from urban company even if they promise anything, waste of your time and money
I need a particular Pro but just cannot find him as app doesn't allow it
Very good service app very professional
The app doesn't work at all. Reinstalled it multiple times to get it to fundtion. Whenever I try to select an option, it either hangs or flashes a message saying 'Simething went wrong. Try again'. Defeats the entire system on how they are supposed to function.
Poor customer support. I booked deep kitchen cleaning service but they said it is showing an add on service in their system. Their system doesnt work properly. However the cleaning person assigned was kind enough to do what we booked.
Charges are very high... In comparison to local helpers
Their agents charged me 3 times more than the rate card... And since 2 weeks they have been telling that I would get a resolution by the end of the day
I had done so many services with ur professional but on 14 September I booked for my washing machine shehnaz Khan was appointed but he is unprofessional, he changed my pcb but it's not working properly he visited 2,3 times but not solved my problem today he is telling adjust with the problem accur ur washing machine is not good what a silly excuse he given n gone telling that kisi aur company k executive ko dikha do
Give Service For Pet's Like Grooming , Basic Bath, Tick and flea Bath,Nail Cliping Ear Cleaning
good
Excellent Services
cleaning work was done very nicely. our home became very neat. we are fully satisfied and vary happy
Terrible service and a bunch of arrogant professionals. Their customer service executives are good for nothing.
Packages are misleading.. Yesterday I booked Home Deep cleaning Services from Urban Ccompany. Not at all satisfied with the way the services are listed. The people who came for service were professionals and did their job well. But there were number of things not included. On my request they did finish that extra work with some extra cost but that should've been included in the package itself as the package was for deep cleaning and not general cleaning.
No customer care number, no provision for booking. Everyday I choose to opt the service...it says... "No service available for this day" and there is no chance to select dates also... I have been checking from many days and the result is same. If there is no provision atleast tell... we cannot service at your location... and there is no contact number to talk...
Damaged comode while cleaning
I'm happy with the maids services as well as the other salon and spa services offered
Poor customer care never get a call back to discuss the customer problems very careless
I have tried their home salon and pest control services and I must say, I was totally satisfied. Booking was convenient. Experts reached on time. Service was absolutely amazing and super professional. Totally recommend this.
Worst service. Cancelllation at the last moment and the reason is service is out of scope.
Very useful in getting quality handyman help
excellent service
Mujhe interview deke 45 days ho Gaye hai aur ab Tak Meri I'd chalu nai hai... Pls help me

I have been using UC for almost 4 years now It's like my personal assistant on call. I Get all services without any hassle. Hoping they will cover the other services like makeup n beauty soon ..
Pathetic HAIR CUT SERVICE....NO RESPONSE..NO REVERT ON A BAD AND UNSATISFACTORY SERVICE ....THERE ARE BETTER APPS THAN URBAN company ....the hair stylist she calls herself doesn't know how to blow dry the hair
Worest service. Don't have trust
Very bad. . They professional didnot come for service, so I resheduled my booking , so they charged me extra cancellation amount.useless, I contact to their help center so many times, but just for 50rs I have to call , mail n recieve calls 50 times. Just useless Help line center just gave to waste our time
Great sevice
When I am trying to select a service like cleaning a specific bathroom 10x, it's not opening and saying something went wrong. Disappointed.
Excellent
very good urban company
I'm very happy
the professional came late
Asta was very professional and well mannered. Very good service.
no response on my booking. horrible service and communication
Worst experience
highly recommended
Kindly avoid urban company services I wasted my whole day for carpenter servcie and that guy didn't come and there is no customer support to help
I have deleted my old review and upgraded the rating from 1 star to 3 star. Urban company is being very strict with professionals and monitoring all aspects of the work including punctuality and quality. This is good from a customer point of view. Customer care is responsive as well. However there are still many places which needs improvement. Urban company seems to have no control over paint delivery persons who wasted so much of my time. Also, give option to update or change rating later.
very good
Some service are high charges. Price list not availbale for middle-class people.
Most worst service in India. Waste and filtered workers they have. Don't go with them
nice work Manish
Good professional service.
Good Service
Third grade service quality and customer care. Don't refund money after failed to perform service and making unreasonable excuse for refunds.
Worst experience. They don't have idea any professional will available for service on customer schedule time of booking. Better to Uninstall this app and look other options
Amazing app and amazing offerings. Although I realised today that there is no single room cleaning option available. It would be nice if that was added to the services.
The app charges cancellation fee even if the professional is created problems.and there is no way of contacting the customer care.
Fully satisfied with the service provided under Urban company. Big THANK YOU
Good experienced service executives in urban company
No change even after 9 months same issues Worst experinece..no technicians available...all mechanics, technicians ( so called professionals ) cheating urbam clap, leadership and management in deep sound sleep, dint install and get headache....Prevention is better than cure....waste app, worst customer care team , professionals looting customers.I stillndobt understabd why they call carpenter, plumber , painter as PROFESSIONAL Shameless Management
all in one app ..
Pathetic services nd customer care no professionalism.
easy to handle and all necessary derives at ur door step , keep it up
Awesome
The 3 star is due to unavailability of certain very useful services like dry vacuuming of sofas and carpets. Only offers dry+wet vacuum. So we cannot customise. Also they take bookings and then sometimes reschedule/cancel. But I've also had succesful bookings for carpenters, plumbers. Those were good.
Thank u for your service and it was awesome. We have also paid 1048
I booked the painting service....the painter were not trained at all..... untrained professionals.....bad experience
Great Experience
Disappointed to see the company's money making policy. I called the UrbanCompany for bathroom cleaning and Plumbing services. In first one, company person used my new full Harpic bottle. I didn't see any Covid protection mask for which the company charges in extra. In plumbing services, there is no fixed service charge. You have to pay for the cost of materials along with service charge for every thing to be repaired. Overall, totally dissatisfied and sure not to recommend to others.
Worst experience. Fraud technicians who dont repair your items and instead remove original parts. Even if you complain Urban clap gives a damn to your complain. Beware guys with such frauds
Professional staff,they know their duties and they are very well trained for his work..I am so much happy to take services from Urban clap.And the most important thing they properly santised everything even himself too..
This has a fleet of big time frauds. They will cheat you, will take your appliance parts and sell it and will say that your machine is irreparable so sell it in scrap. No way you can contact the Urban Company. Never allow these people in your home. They will loot you.
Satisfied services. Using this app for more than 2 years.
Unreliable Services. Should be avoided. Better to get it done from local providers
Not get services on assigned time.they refuse to assign their professionals.
good app
Excellent service..
I had a good experience with UC over last two to three years. But now, I'm changing my review as the professionalism in UC's services is nose diving. I have booked their "salon at home" service four times in last 2 months, out of which, three times they couldn't provide a beautician. The main reason for that, as I could see is monopoly of beauticians in a particular area.
doesn't keep payment record updated and un contactable customer care
Unprofessional men from company side for chimney cleaning wrong chemical used chimney becom blacküò≤
What's issue with sharing help desk contact details? The layout of app sucks...
very very bad experience. the technician has no skill at all. in the last one month he came for sqme issue and could not resolve. but every time he charged about 1500 Rs. I am still not sure if the issue would be resolved.
Easy to find all the service for your daily needs. Staying at Ghola, Sodepur it's hard to find electrician, plumber, carpenter for small works. Apart from haircut these are some of essential services. With urbanclap I feel relaxed and tension free. Keep the good service.
Most pathetic and third class app. Worst service. No customer care number... Really messy and worst app. Better go for other options
I like the professional approach right from beginning of booking till completion of the order. Keep it up!
Very nice app..
Overall good service
Most irresponsible company.There are no sos contact numbers to contact in case of any problem or emergency.want full payment in advance but when problem emerges they avoid to resolve.They may ok for miscellaneous v.small works
Service is bad
Very nice
Technician told me cancel the complaint
Very bad experience. Poor services
I booked the washroom cleaning services.Firstly they were not on time and after reaching they stated that cleaning service type need to change whereas before booking we thoroughly checked the washroom & what all includes in specific service type. We were agreed on higher cleaning service type Move In but they do not come with proper machinery/tool and denied to perform the services. Really disappointed.Please do not waste the customer's time in the future and do not give any false commitment.
Very disappointing behaviour of Urban Campany staff. I have booked twice for home painter services. No one came for visit altgough I have paid the consultancy fees. Whole day I was calling/waiting but still no responce.
Highly unprofessional....professional was already 1 hour late and had high temperature also when checked at my society gate hence, had to cancel the booking... Full refund also not initiated, deducted rs 300 against the membership which I even didn't take..
I am too much fed-up with urban company ...they have no bengali caller in west bengal..same same..and resedule chage from customer if you take you have also pay....very bad very bad experience by current professionals...some one want to puch selling the services...some one cancle the the services...very very very bad experience...
Neat user interface
Rates are so high
Poor service. The professionals do not arrive at time and do not pick their phone Terrible. Didn't expect this from you
Salon services are ok. Very dissatisfied with the unprofessional behaviour of cleaning person. It is also not easy to contact UC for any quick clarifications and resolution. Even when the customer care assured that professional will come, he did not turn up and refused services.
excellent work
I am not able to access the app all of a sudden. I have the proplus membership.
Service Standard is perfect
very bad company
good
Worst company and sevice ever. I've had my ac serviced from you and it never worked, rather it broke down after I had to keep calling you multiple times. Your agents broke my ac, it stopped functioning even the little bit it did. I demanded compensation, I never got anything. UC just vanished then. I bought a massage package, whenever I book an appointment, either the massuese denies sevice, is hours late, or is never assigned. Worst sevice ever!!
Not up t o the mark
Great
Yah team u r services are good. Even after 90 days the problem persist we couldn't find the warranty period to contact.
Unprofessional behaviour by the staff.we had booked a schedule but they didnot even bothered to confirm our booking and was rescheduling the time by their own.very much dissappointed by their service
Too Expensive for their poor service
ok
Its very good service
Good services
Horrible service and the service center representative.they are not bothered of providing the service. And even they don't follow up with the professional if they are being assigned to any service. The cancellation option should not be provided to professional.only the service center rep should have the options for such.
Very bad experience. Got burn on upar Arm. Your professional forgot to de-tan. Don't even she know what to give in service. She was unprofessional. Very bad experience Urban Company. I never ever take your service.
Very good
Worst app it reducing many ads guys plz don't download It,üòëüòëüòëüòë
Poor service.. and not worthy for money and time...
Great Service @great price.
excellent work
Have availed services multiple times. They are good and reliable
The app and the company is next to the cheater.Never book any annual service and pay priorly.You won't get the second service nor can book it for second service .In course of time your money will be cheated.I booked a one year maintenance service for my ac and paid the whole amount.I got the first service but after the completion of three months I tried to book for the second service but couldn't do it.I sent mail to the company and their head office too.But no initiative is taken.Got cheated.
Poor and false promises
There is no option for single room kitchen attached in it why should I pay thousands for just one room set no bathroom is needed..
Excellent spa service at the comfort of your home. All setting from the massage table to music and oils provided for
UC makes life easy
Customer service and their resolution is very quick and satisfactory. I love it.
Haircut service not good.Not trained professional.
Worst service not as described in website. Totally dissatisfied with the service rendered.
very nyc work done by Kusum .
Urban company is very good I like urban company mujhe bohot help mili h thank you so much urban company
Got sofa cleaning done. Very thorough and Profesional Job done

Good Service
The home cleaning services are just a hoax... basically a cheating company,who has no control over their vendors
Excellent service
Good
Professional has not arrived
Why don't you include Hindu priest services in urban clap
saloon service is always good... they have well mannered people ( saloon service)
There is no way you can contact Urban Company prior to placing an order, something that you need once in a while.
excellent
No credibility or commitment to service and their customer service is not cooperative at all.
good
Excellent
nice service
great app!
No one to talk about the issues. No customer care is responding to listen for the issues
Super...
Bills are pre prepared. Service charges and visit charges both on a single visit. Need to change the approach to income money.
No time since
Nice
Fraud people... fraud company..they are just cheating and looting customer.. uninstall their app..and try your best to shut these all cheaters company permanently.
It's scam, initially it shown me 190 rs for washing machine repair, I paid the same, after technician visit again it's showing another 189rs, he is saying that intial 190 is for only visiting, does the techinician is a celebrity or what to pay for his visit only, he came to fix the problem only right, why again 190 for his repair charges
Stupid people with no customer care service. No visits. Delayed responses. No resolutions. Shut down your business
Once you pay they will ignore you ... even if the work is not done
It was my first experience with Urban company. I booked for a bathroom cleaning service ( 'Move in deep cleaning' category ) . The boy Sahid worked for more than 2 hours on 28.8.21, but failed to remove the rust/iron from bathroom, as he was not having the proper tools, otherwise it was OK. But he promised that he will get the tool shortly and he will make it as soon as he get it. Today Sahid came again with tools and worked for 3hrs with tremendous sincerity & perfection and satisfied us.
Worst service ever.
nice
Good
Worth money services rendered. It was my first experience with you guys and the person was amazing, he was so polite and therein he did his job religiously. Amazing services delivered by Urban Company and thanks for keeping Gem person who are giving extra stars to your work.
Pathetic service. Wont recommend to anyone.
If your beautician is late in the 1st appointment because of the rain, does that mean she will leave early without completing her work

No ikea furniture assembly in my area in pune 411041
Delayed service for an hour without any valid reason...had to reschedule - didn't find any link in the application to raise a concern....
Very good services.
Service was easy to select and workers assigned were skilled and well mannered. Makes life simple
Frustating experience with chef services... neither the person arrived nor the support from UC worked .. not even the emergency helpline was picking üòäüòäüòä . All sort of odds happened to spoil things Anyways , a learning to me on expectations from such services
Online payment made....no service received.....no any helpline no or email for customer compliants in the app.....total waste of money....very bas experience....... ...second worst experience on 25/09/2021 regarding water purifier service....company and professional alloted have different rate cards.....once you book full service at specific cost, the alloted professional on appointed day will deny for service with order amount and will demand more cost, saying that UC's parts are costly......
Smooth !
good app
Fantastic service!
I am not able to find whether my area comes under ur service or not.Kindly help on this.
Only few services are good .
This Is Best App And There Service Is Excellent. Service man Always wear Mask and gloves during repairing and pricing is regnable. good App üëçüëç
Had booked an order for painting but after the painting cracks popped up and they refused to fix it giving various reasons. Pathetic work.
Pathetic experience. They call themselves as professionals. I booked an appointment at 10.30 and the professional did not come/called/messaged and on top of it he's not receiving the call either.
very productive experience
Professional work at affordable price.whole process hassle free.
Your salon services is always great but service In plumber and service furniture repairing is very pathetic whenever you book the plumber or any other, they come and whatever the reason they give you and they never come again. Bakwas
good job
One of the worst service providing company I have come across with. Completely unprofessional and never cares about customer experience.
Services at the comfort of ur home... Well trained professionals
well done
420 company
Very poor.Pathetic
IT IS THE PERFECT APP FOR SERVICES.
You stared loosing faith of customers as no contact for customer cars Beautician didn't come and canceled the booking, someone may have some plan right pathenic!!
Moving down to 1 star, company forgot about customer service. They forgot their early days, instead of solving problems, creating more and terrible customer support. They don't don't have customer service contact number or email visible in app.
Well done keep it up
Very good app nd very easy for own work
Very worst....no proper technician in company...i lost my new brand ac ...after service and gas filling i lost my ac cooling...company's guy suggest me that ill take retuen my complain......pls do not try
I booked pest control service which gave 90 days guarantee but it was waste. Neither there is any option to raise complaint.
Good job done by UC.
Charged double for assemble one tv cabinet. Horrible experience... Overpriced. I paid 750 + change just to assemble a tv cabinet.. not up to the mark horrible and horrifying experience... no more urban clap for any job bloody useless
Good cleaning ...satisfied
Excellent
good
Full of fraud tv technician ... Worst experience .. who took my tv theft inside panels .. gave it local led backlit .. dnt use the app only
This isvthe first time I have availed this service and I am satisfied.
üëå
The company is the worst. I have tried to book a service for about 5 weeks in a row and every week my booking gets canceled or the professional never responds, and if I get a response the professional will arrive an hour late!!! Absolutely no support from the customer service, they don't know how to speak to customers or don't even try to find a solution. Absolutely the worst experience ever!!!
Very good service providers
The company doesn't call back. No proper customer service available.
They compalain the things are dirty which is irritating and annoying I think they forget that we call them to clean our stuff ,not to complain.
Worst service I book for refrigerator service for today but no one technician came for my home.
Very systamatic, full safety measures, NagaLata is very skillful.
Never ever use this application.
I opted for Cleaning services. The service is excellent.
Good work and well spoken
Very bad service
I liked her service and good in her work.
We booked a service and just 10mins prior the scheduled time they are informing they don't have a profesional. Very bad service. If professionals not available you shouldn't have that time slot in your booking options. Need to improve your service.
Very unprofessional people.. give some time to schedule.. then rescheduling without permission.. when enquired about the same.. they are saying their agents/service people are not available.. they have no control over their service.. and customer support has no way to support customers.. Asking card details or making us pay before service is just a scam.. Dont use..
Superb
Good
Great service and employees.
Bad
It's total time and money waste.Better to get service done from manufacturer it self.I was asked for more money than the quoted price and denied the reason.
Very helpful
They are careless.. their rep broke my fan and no one is there to help. No. phone no. Raised a complaint. No one is calling. I lost my 6k worth fan and also paid them .. never use theri services again.
She is polite and nice behaviour and amazing sevice üëç
excellent service provider for hair cutting and house related works.. I really like there services very much.
I recommend UC. Very setisfed with the service.
I'm knocking off one star not due to bad experience but simply because it's appalling that not every professional is vaccinated. I rescheduled a booking for part time cleaning because of this. The company really ought to look into getting each professional vaccinated - for everyone's safety! With that being said, their customer support team has been great and I give them 5* for being so helpful and accommodating :)
Excellent
Very good
Excellent
Good and fast ‚ò∫Ô∏è
amazing haircut fully trained, truly professional
No service in my area üò©
No respect of time .if we cancel booking they charge 100 rs. But they can come late, professional do not take call, careless attitude Pathetic. Must close their comp
Urban compay is the worst app I have ever used .They take pre-paymemt first and at the time of project there professional denies to provide services .Then your money stucks and your time is wasted . Such a mental harassment . Highly unprofessional & unethical professional they have .
The split Daikin AC I am having is having continuous problem of water leakage. This is the issue for the last 18 months. Urban Company technicians come and go including revisit still the problem persists. All the tecchnicians insists on good rating at the end of the service which I did at their request. Untill and unless 1-2 months have gone it is not prudent to ask for rating. Today also I got the AC serviced for water leakage. I don't know how long my AC will work properly.
I need a call back. Its extremely difficult to contact you...
Repair Equipment on UC's app is overpriced with high margins
So far satisfied with the services used.
Lovely experience happy to use this app üòä
Very useful app
shakshi is a wonderful person and will assign her to next service also. thankyou sakshi and urbanclap.
No respond to your issue ...they have no contact no and no one gives invoice of services...will not suggest anyone to use urban clap services ...poor customer service
Very bad
Chor company ha jion nahi karna
unprofessional company bad experiance to ac service
The cleaner was late for 1 hour and she has informed that the vehicle doesn't have gas and I have to reschedule. The cleaner didn't bring the supplies with her and I paid extra for supplies The worst company I've dealt with till now
I call salon men for our males and ladies thru your reputed company. But the ladies they mess up the room and the toilet. Men gather all the cut hair and wastes and dispose off on their own by carrying it. They don't even wash their dishes at my home. But ladies they use the sink to wash their dye bowl and comb and brush and oily dishes and dirty my sink. Whereas men don't. Mind you please urban services that the ladies don't mess the bathroom by washing and leaving sink dirty. I can send pics
They provide duplicate filters of water purifier
Useless service
On 23/09/2021 plumber came for replacement of facet.He has not fixed it properly.Next day it self it has become loose and water came out.
My booking for rooms painting for 22nd September is still pending. No contact from either UC or the professional. Advance money paid. Pathetic experience.
Chor hai don't use this aap
Not perfect
Thanks for solving the issue. Great support.
Not as expected. There is no way to contact customer care from app. It's awlays easy to call and get issue resolved rather than selecting multiple contact us menus.
excellent services
Worst service provider. Worst service provider. Due to which I got the air conditioner service done, then the problem came in 80 days. If you came to fix the complaint and again in 15 days the same problem has come, now the complaint is there, then their executive says that your warranty was up to 90 days, now you request for service again. Means I should spend Rs.4000 again now, after every 3 months I should get service done.üëé
best
Poor No commitment
Very bad Experience I have RO from UC .It was faulty and retuned it .But they have not refunding my money . No customer care is available . They are farud .I have lost my 9k Don't trust on them
I want service here in prayagraj..aa there is lack of good salon and massage centre...I shall be highly grateful if u will open ur centre here and provide ur service door to door as u did it in other cities...
Very useful. Urban Company has really good standard of service
I not happy with your service, your Assigned Male person Mohamed asif of my hair spa service, when he called me that time I said, I want women not men, he said ok I'll send, but without informed me one women came, but not showing booking history in urban company, fraud with me. My msg all are alerts please üôè
my first time service good service Kavita Rathore
Payment made to the person. Still showing as payment pending and unable to book a service.
Nice service done.
Dont take their personal chef service. Last 2 days i am contacting their customer care to assign chef but ther are not doing that ...very bad customer service now a days....
great job. good service
Beware of this fraud company called "Urban Company"...My bad luck that I didn't read users' reviews before downloading their app..There are so many unsatisfied customers who have given their complaints and comments...For me, I booked a plumbing service and these people sent me a person not knowing even how to take out a screw..Now not refunding money and not replying...They themselves closed my issue without resolving it..BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY...URBAN COMPANY IS A CHEATER COMPANY..
overall satisfactory.
UC GOOD WORK
good
Urban clap services has never disappointed me.
he is doing well proffetional
The worst app. The app asks a customer to rate it's assigned professional after you avail a service. When I rated 3.5 or 3 they (urban company) automatically change it to 4.6 or more. If you manipulate rating given by a customer, what is the need and purpose of having a rating system?? Completely deceptive. Not just 1 or 2times ,it has happened more than 3times for me. Please avoid using urban company services
Not so good as acceptation service is soo poor I not refer to take this service from this company time waste
Amazing experience
Perfect
Booked AC repair as ac was cooling only on 22 degree and not above that, the technician came took the ac along saying needs servicing and need to check if any leakage, next day came back,refilled gas which was removed to take out ac and charged me 3000 + for that, post which after connecting my AC back they say yes sir your ac is having some problem its only cooling on 22 & below so we need to check logic board & sensor, I asked them to leave, asked for support from UC but no luck till date
Hangs a lot. Unable to book a service sometimes. The page refreshes when you want to see any service details. Recently money got deducted but service wasn't booked. Not able to connect with customer care either for this issue. Professionals are good though. But they are let down by a terrible app.
I have booked for washing machine repair and paid 199 rupees. Washing machine technician came and checked he said that drain motor repair. He said 1400 rupees plus replacement charge 400 rupees. I said ok change Mean time i checked online rate is 600 rupees. He came with drain motor, l told him checked on line rate is 600 rupees. (See the rate difference 800 rupees is extra) At once he said this is our company rate if you want we will change otherwise I will leave. Still now the did not repay
very good
Saloon service is good other services (cleaning) is very poor , professional equipment and material are not upto the mark ... person came for my bathroom cleaning did hard work but the cleaning agent he used was not good ...stains did not remove... disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è
very nice service
Good service üëç
Like a nonsens service you dont have customer care number then how to deal with you and cantact with you
great work great technicians
very good service
The technician is polite explain details of the job n suggested.
it was fantastic and session was very relaxing.... would definitely recommend
Professional didn't clean chimney tray stain and did not inform me and left in hurry . Poor service.
Excellent services
good
Professional service .. refreshing change
very nice i like it .
Most of the times the professionals are not available for saloon booking even if you book in advance. They charge 50 rupees extra for using disposable aprons and sheets but the many times these are not provided. Availability of professionals is a major issue. Since last 3 times I have been unable to find a booking.
very good service
I got done the electric gycer service few months back. The technician who serviced had done some jugad electric work to fix the issue. Due to that now the gycer is not functioning properly. I have fixed the appointment with the gycer company technician Havels. They are saying that the guy who serviced made mistake. And removed important parts which are very dangerous and very sencetive in gycer during shock. Now I have to pay almost 1800 to fix the same issue.
Pathetic service. I dont have option minus rating. If professional broke any thing then they dont give claim. Beware before booking
Again booked service same no improvement on service..I don't recommend this to anyone worst service...i dont recommend any more.after sending mail also uc least bothered about rever..
Servicing of A/C is required. At my residence at 13/8 Taramoni ghat road. Kolkata 700041 near itkhola bridge. Paschim putiary.
Their professional take money and doesn't do any repair work plus the warranty they provide say is just for the sake of saying. Once urban company and its professional gets the money trust me no one will turn back to provide warranty service.
The service is good.
nice üëç work and service
I have cancelled my booking on 10th September but i don't get my refund amount right now üëé
My experience is very good. However Urban Company should provide double vaccinated workers. The carpenter who came was only single vaccinated. This is UC's responsibility in Covid situation.
Very poor response. Booked for complete home deep cleaning, but the team refused to clean essentials. Moreover Urban Company deducted 500rs as cancellation charges. Very unprofessional
Exceptional Service.
Otherthan salon service like home cleaning etc.very poor accessories unhygience used and old materials. Its not safe to utilize other than salon
high price
Awesome and happy excellent
Hats off to your company, really you people are offering great service. Sitting at home only all needs are fulfilled. Keep up the good work.
very good work
wonderful service experience with urban clap. very neat and clean work
Not any more professional. And they are not even refunding the orders they cancelled themselves since 20 days they owe me money and nobody is taking action although I said fine to be in my wallet.
I booked move-in cleani g for two bathrooms. Your person used our buckets n a small stool to clean the bathrooms. Due to the chemicals he used, the stool and buckets have got lots of white patches and looks very dirty. I have raised this issue multiple times, but there is no response from you. Paid 1100/- for this work and still had to suffer with the side effects. This is not acceptable.
Experienced staff. Very punctual of time. Satisfactory work on reasonable prices. Keep it up.
Forcing people to buy UC plus plan.. Why do you force people to buy Membership plan... Iam trying to book a service but it's forcing me to take either of the uc plus plans.. This is really very absurd and robbery
Cheatt!! They hadn't assigned any professional for my booking at 10am. And on cancelling it at 9:58am, they charged me a cancellation fee for that as well. Can't the customers be informed if there's no PROFESSIONAL AVAILABLE???? Simply playing along and wasting people's time
Great.
Such a shameful company. Neither they bother to get back to you on time nor they bother to update for the service you have opted.
Pet Grooming Facilities Nit Available
Executive don't come on time, work done by executive are good but no punctuality at all
This app is very helpfull one.. so everyone difinately try once for every services u can get this appüòäüëå
Other charge is very high and safety price not good only mast you get 39 but only mask and senetizer total cost 5 rupes you get 39 not good
Very poor service by urban club. Please don't book them for mover n packers. Mr. rishi from Urban Club is the worst service advisor.
Terrible experience with the plumber
i booked UC for my hitachi repair.. they came and denied the repair..saying there is a gas leak.. i asked for service then..ready to pay the difference of charge ..but they denied this too..asking for revisit..and all renewed charges again. finally they took 350 rs only for a five min visit..doing nothing.. just looted money out of you.
Recently availed painting services, extremely disappointed with the professionalism, as its contracted outside the full ownership from urban is not there. Basis things like covering furniture, taking care of moving household things properly. Also spitting in the toilet area with tobacco stains was seen. The finishing of the painting is also not upto the mark, very superficial filling and leveling with putty before painting. Overall Extremely disattissfied
Third class app..professional cancel the service or dont turn up and there call centre executives just say we are sorry please cancel your booking we will look i to this..pathetic service..never ever booked with them
Superb thanks
5 star
Worst experience, I would strictly recomend not to purchase RO, I purchased and the installation person drilled in water pipe now I am covering all the damage, I even raised the complain however no one is responding or contacted me yet. Worst experience, just like hell, pathetic.
Good job and well mannered professional
I m getting frustated from last two days, I get their service for carpenter one month back, they told me I have ‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡§Ç‡§ü‡•Ä of one month but I tried to book revisit and two days ‡§™‡§æ‡§∏ and no one assiened n ‡§ï‡§Æ for revisit, company contact ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§π‡•Ä,
Very wrost customer service. Please do not trust them. Nobody is responding. I've booked a tv repair service, executive told me that Rs 2600 would be charge. He did job and ask me to pay directly cash to him not to UC and forcing me for rate 5 star for him. When I have checked the rate card, only 1800 (600x3) backlight was there. When I ask him, he told that he fitted genuine parts and price mentioned on rate card are for Chinese parts. Even no invoice was given for the same.
Chip, typical app,
Sara was very good satisfied with the service she clean properly and manage all work
he did an excellent job!
Excellent experience. Keep up the good work.
Great services and favorable pricing.
A Fraud Company Imagine a company which has no customer care email or phone no. Whereas for UAE and Australia, they have both. They cheat you like noone else and you have no way of getting your money back for services they assured and never delivered. Not giving a customer care support shows that they treat Indian like fools whereas providing support in other countries.
It was awesome experience and done the job professionally. Best wishes to the company. Cheers
very nice service.
Very poor service and there is no contact number available for any assistance
Very costly as per service provided
Worst pathetic
Totally useless, didn't serve the purpose at all, waste of money and time, no live customer support available, poor experience
Based on review's
Hidden charges added during billing after service selected to compensate membeship discounts. Company is not ethical at all.
1.I took their service just 3 times,first time it was amazing,next time after the massage, my condition detoriated and I had to consult doctor.2.Third time I ordered for skin brightening facial, she did her work well, but after 3-4 days pimples popped up all over my face,visited dermatologist now. 3.Worst part is service providers will explicitly ask for a 5 star rating and good comments. 4.They do their job well, but last 2 experiences for me wore really worst. Atleast I will never book again
Worst app too much visiting charges
Extremely well trained and well groomed professional. The professional followed all Covid protocols and did a wonderful service. Thanks to UC!
very good excellent work and service, and economical.
Very good amazing
Very bad experience. No proper customer support. UC take advance payament and then have to follow multiple times that too being UC plus member. Mine was really horible experience.
Waste of money and time Dissatisfied with the work. They promised to remove all stain but it didn't work. Don't call them worst experience. Really fell bad. Urban company are worstüòíüòìüòìüòì Very poor service. Urban company look into it and need my money back.
Excellent service and time punctuality is maintained well
Thoroughly unprofessional service...I am a working professional and had to adjust my timings before setting up the appointment. 20 minutes before my service is due, the so called professional cancels upon me! Is this what you call customer satisfaction?? If one professional is cancelling send another one...why are you wasting someone's time??
Pathetic service from urban company customer care
it was a great experience... beautician is too good in behaviour and caring...
Pathetic service, After RO service it's not working properly. Customer care team promised me to correct but no one came. Very bad experience, pls go for respective company vendor instead of UC.
Very bad service professional ko bhi paresan karte h ye
Useless app for customer, it is made unilaterally for UC benifits only. Customer cannot access any representative from UC. This app dont have any tickets to raise against representatives.
At times the services are good, but the quality isn't consistent. My experience has been good with beauty services but horrible with plumbers, electricians etc.
she was so good, hygiene maintained to best,well groomed and service was excellent,I would recommend her
This is a good company to go for several household needs especially for senior citizens.
Great service, very affordable
Pathetic quality of execution for high value transactions like Painting. I booked painting job paid 29k and guys did half the job and vanished. Not answering to calls. Worst is even Urban Company guys don't respond to complaints raised and keeping mum about it, they t hand in glove in this scam. Take money do half job and dont respond to complaints....am filing a consumer court case against UC for this deficiency in service. Even without service closing this is the state of affairs.
When I booked for the first time,I had a terrible experience with the cleaner.He didn't clean properly and started arguing with me.BUT the second time...AHAAN was the helper,he did a good job and was also so polite.I request Urban clap to employ such people who do the best they can.
Very Bad experience as the tv technician came and informed that the part is not working without even touching or opening the panel... Took 448 rs for visit which way too expensive.. I had informed on the app about the issue then too technician was sent n charged 448 for just visiting.. This is fooling customers
Excellent service
They are not committed to time. I scheduled part time maid service at 12 noon, professional asigned, All good. 11.45, the app shows that the profesional is on the way. 12.30, the professional is still on the way.I Call the professional, they r not coming.I call the support, they apologize& reschedule.When I reschdule, I get penalized.When the company reschedules and cause me inconvenience, I get a Sorry.Why shouldnt the company be penalized?Specially when they dnt update even 30 mins after.
They fixed my fridge 5 times and charged all the times. But still its same after 2-3 months
Very good service. Thank u
Guys indians please beware of this fraud company .i prepaid via gpay for sofa cleaning service and on app it's showing payment failed and after that i didn't received any refund and this fraud urban clap company saying that they didn't received payment ..fraud happened with me ..my hard earned money gone
Good
App is robust, never faced any problems till now. Easy user navigation and clear content. Whatever services I've tried till now have been very good.
Booked a plumber.But they could NOT arrange one same day or for next 2 days.And help desk is in Gurgaon while service needed is in Bangalore
Pathetic
Not in gwalior
Perfect
Nice experience
Very poor services.. The so called professions never arrives instead they send someone else.. Please don't waste your time bookinh any services with urban compnay
Excellent service provided by rahul mandal for rectifying my geyser problem
COMPLIED ALL COVID PROTOCOL
Why are you charging your customers for training your partners?!!! Why would we bear this! We should pay only for services. Money matters for everyone. Not every customer of yours is rich. Also customer care service is very poor. Earlier this used to be my favourite app but now services have deteriorated
Service improved so increased the rating too.
Half of the time the Vendor doesn't turn up and UC doesn't have any control on the Vendor
Urbon company is very ved working becose totally not good work done very bed company iam urbon company profesional but I konow that's is frod company
Excellent service
very convenient rather then calling the individuals.. here you know how much you need to spend for the job...
I had an issue with my semi-automatic  washing machine (Mitashi) (spin) was not working properly.  The technician came and did some temporary repairs also status that your machine is not branded so I will do a temporary fix. His temporary fix has created more problems now the drainer is not working. You shouldn't hire such unprofessional technicians. MONEY & WASTE OF TIME. - You should have First call Resolution. But in my case, the issue persists.
The description for any particular service is misleading and does not cover a complete list of included items in that service. So difficult to understand what's covered and what is an additional. No customer care helpline provided.
Pathetic service these guys are providing, I would recommend everyone not to use their any of the service. The part of my washing machine took by their technician and it's been 5 days that he has not come back neither he picks my call. Their customer support is too miserable
Yesterday I got my sofa cleaned.. but today now when it is dry I found the old dirt marks still there.. i want my money to be refunded or get my sofa cleaned again as soon as possible.. I want that someone should come to my place a nd see the the work done by UC ..
Worst Experiance. I used sofa cleaning service person come and complet the service and person told after dry it will look clean but even after dry its looks same as before washing.Even he has remove button of sofa which is now cannot put again. In short bad quality and staff without experiance
Horrible.refund isn't given I want both my refunds immediately
prompt and safe and nice service.
Very poor service.
Nice apps
Pest treatment service is a disaster. As per serving terms first there is spray and then gel treatment after 15 days.. We paid for whole house and person did spray only in kitchen amd bathroom. We had to call urban to get him do in remaining 3 rooms Now after 15 days no one is coming for gel treatment. Have raised 3 complaints on Urban but no one is even calling back. It's now 19 days and cockroaches are again returning. I should have taken service from local society person only
Worst..paid for plumber and buyed products no call from them..when I enquired 3 times rescheduled n final answer is we don't serve commercial washroom s ok when asked for payment refunded me plumber service but not the products I bought cheating
Can't book a service without buying a membership? Don't force user to buy membership just for a haircut. Membership must be optional.
It‚Äôs not working. I cannot place my name. Every time it‚Äôs shown that the number invalid. So i delete the app.
good
No service available in my city (Lucknow- Uttar Pradesh) since nearly 3 months.Please look into this matter.
Worst available app in playstore , only pulling customers to sell things when you stuck with services you'll never get help, you will never trace customer care number, you'll never get a reply over tweet , they don't bother to prove their existence , they will change their name again when they'll done , this the way they are surviving. They caught the need of the market but they never value their customers . A sad customer brings a company down their knees, it is never happened stop assume.
Pathetic , I had scheduled a carpenter for the next day.. evening there was no carpenter assigned.. at all.. wen I called them they told the will reschedule it for tomorrow.. there was no assignment of carpenter even on the next day.. bad service.. please don't go for it... I wasted 3 hours waiting for it.. the customer support doesn't even know to speak English
Happy with the service
the service was üëç
Very fast and good service..
Unprofessional people and doesn't match the description given
sarisfied customer
very convenient cleaning
Worst support. It cost me 6k for servicing my 1ton window AC. Water went inside the motor and causes a short-circuit. Be carefull, the technicians are not even professional.
Massage Therapy was excellent
It's great service by Urban company
Useless still my prblm is unsolved
Nice
Very good
Trouble free
People don't turn up on time
Useless team promises to call back within 24hrs they are yet to call, booked service 1st time the professional didnt turn up, was asked to reschedule and 2nd time the professional didnt turn up and when i cotacted UC for help, all that they can do is asking me reschedule my service again. Please dont use UC and i recommend everyone not to use their services as they have taken customers for granted and provide horribe experience. I only see sorry and send contact details for all the issues listed
work is good but charged 400/- more for fixing a cock instead of adapter.
Has become really really expensive for the services.
excellent service. polite professional.
Good experiences till now! Hope you upkeep the repo gained and keep working to your best!
superb.....
little bit overpriced
Thanxs to urban company
Very bad
Worst experience!!! Don't book them, they've really taken a fall. First I had membership and no updates or any discounts were given, also when I called one of their professionals they sended a local beautician; she, Maya was 3hrs late, we had to go somewhere which led us to leave 1-2 things in the order, she said she'll come later and do it but never showed up or was contacting neither the company had a good customer service which might've helped us. Just my worst experience ever...
My family have opted for pest control, but after having 3 pest control in my flat within a month, still pest are roaming like enjoying picnic. Their chemical used in pest control are not at all effective. Cocroahes can still freely move after having this so called chemical as their(cocroahes) lunch/dinner. I won't recommend anybody to book pest control service from urbanclap because they are not providing warrantee of the service which is mentioned in app.
Worst worst worst service I have rescheduled my booking for two times every time urban clap professional is asking for rescheduling
thank you
After my ac servicing, my ac stop working. Even I can not contact any customer support , not contact no has been provided.
The promo code itself do not contain specific term and conditions, even after application of promo code they say that you have to pay the amount of the promo code also no proper reply available with the executive. This is simply misleading the people by giving promo code
Service boy is very bad
very nice I'm so happy..
Very disappointed with urban company,. After request is placed payment made for RO full service including replacing membrane, they have demanded for more money saying membrane cost is 2k more for the filter model I have... So my experience with urban company is, we shld not make any payment in advance till we get service from them... I found it's like literally they are cheating on customers.
Company not taking responsibility about services
UC = useless company Had booked for kitchen cleaning, with utensils removal and placement included. The professional came 1.5 hours later and said that he is not going to remove utensils and keep it back as its not mentioned in his job. He also said the kitchen was too big to clean. They will get in touch with me and ask me to write an email. To which they will apologise. Which doesn't solve any problem. So yeah. Sucks!
vare good
Exelent
It is safe cheap and do the work required Excellent work quality work.
service is very unprofessional
The Jaipur office of this company: A girl named Anisha Bansal works in that office, who does not have the ability to talk at all.And he talked to me in a very bad way. so me apko yahi btana chahunga ki ap log soch samjh kr hi is company k sath jude taki in future apki self respect per koi ungli na utha ske. Thanks. Urban company
No option to contact support staff
you will clean very nice urban company's work is perfect
I wanted to contact them for my home painting But I couldn't get them
Disgusting app... Maine kabka uninstall kar diya tha...still mujhe whtsp par contiusly msg karta rhta h bar bar report and block karneke bad v...are yr mujhe nhi use karna ..cd u pls stop ths nonsnce
Poor management. They are not able to assign a carpenter even after waiting for two days. Hopless service. They will take you money first and they make you dance to their beats..
Their is no priority for members; pathetic after sales service...no follow ups from UC for bad service... No Customer care number provided to reach them...it's a pain giving company...
good
prices are high
ver very good and cost affective.
I want to consult before booking any service. There is no customer care number. If there is no person I can talk to then what is the point of having such service at all. Need to find some other service provider.
Worst service compared to others heavy amount charged please go through with local workers they will get benefit instead of this looting companies there marketing is heavy but the work is not efficiency don't install this app
Almost perfect app for so many tasks one needs in running a home. A small suggestion - for some specific services not listed in the app, it would be great if the customer can connect with the technician and enquire if that service is available or not.
excellent
excellent staff and service technicians
There is some issues with payment page. It changes something credpay shows sometimes it doesn't
The so called professional was very unprofessional. Worst experience.
To pricey
No proper updates in App, interface are good. Please provide service as well.
excellent massage
Same time very good same time not badüòéüëçüëé
nice experience
Nice
excellent service
good job
i have already booked yesterday night for refrigerator service i.e on 20th and reschedule to next day morning and there is no proper response at all... it's waste of time and money ... I have already booked it before for TV service and now also for refrigerator! But no response I will never ever book again for the services from urban clap!! thank you for everything!!
Worest of the app no helpline support no result the cleaning customer care called asking the pls give me 5star good positive so many times asking dont book the service my suggestion
I am not able to see cred pay as payment option What should I do?
Absolutely poor service. I had booked window cleaning services and the cleaner told me that he will only clean the window glasses and not the track where windows are fitted. Absurd reason given. Helpdesk also didn't help. The service description on the app is not clear and the workers are not directed well. Very rude engineers specifically Sangesh Dhotre. I am uninstalling the app.
Not bad
My new AC has been damaged by Urbanclap technicians. I need my new AC back. Will file a legal case against Urbanclap
Never opt for Bathroom and Kitchen Cleaning..Very Bad Service ..My Domestic Help does a better job..Waste of money and time..The staff who came was totally unaware as to what to be done..I wish I could give Zero Stars ..
These charge for PPE kit, but service professional does not wear PPE kit. Direct cheating the customers
Excellent app & good service
I did not rate Mr Husain Sayyed. How it is displaying that he got 5star rating from me?
There is no option for office cleaning. And once any other service added, the cart is not visible. Also, no direct customer care number to solve any problem.
Credpay not showing during payment. How to use Credpay for making online payment
Maine bug control treatment karwaya tha.jisme 90days ki guarantee thi..lekin 2 week ke baad hi fir se bug katne lage h aur app me service ki complaint karne ka bhi koi option nahi hai
good
good
good
Nice service, professional well behaved and high in ambience level
I use paste control service, ot was excellent üëå
Overall I like the process but I request Urban company to train the service team not to ask rating in front of customers and they are forcing us to give rating 5 which we cannot say No directly. That's the reason some service persons get rating good but work is average.
Now their service is going worst day by day. They are not giving customer support instantly.
No services in redhills location
Very good service at your doorstep...very prompt and excellent service guys...highly recommend
Reasonable rate and neat work
The professionla who visited spoiled the shower set in my bathroom and I have raised multiple tickets regarding this and I did not receive any proper feedback or solution regarding my issue.
I have booked a painting service. They are not completing the job for the past 1 month. I am tired of complaining. I had paid the total amount but now my money is stuck.
We used their services twice. 1st time was for washroom cleaning. The guy was unprofessional and did shabby work. 2and time we called a carpenter for some estimates. Though work is not yet started but he was well behaved and looks as if knows the job.
U replyed ur mail id to comunicating for that... I mailed twice but even one mail u didnt replyed... How waste of public money u cheated... Ur app person to service at our home it is not working how cheat of people..
staffs are fully vaccinated and services are also good.
Worst app with unprofessional technicians and no way to get intouch with them. Has left a bad taste with their service.
The person is polite and did the work without any hurry.
Uc is a fraud company , they do not have any employee , they are a third party broker . They show u a rosey picture but in reality it's a disaster. Not reliable .
Worst service they do not hold customer service as well in the help center they mention that they will call us within 60 mins but will never get a call We have booked for uninstall and instal of ro water purifier. It was uninstalled at old location and now not one is bothered to instal at new one. We tried reaching out to customer service and they mentioned that amount will be credited as uc credits but till now nothing has happened we are tired of trying all means since 4 days but of no use
Pls call me I'm not able to register my voucher
nice work
Professional postpone the service, I want immediately another person, any time this type of same issue coming, urban company professionals not keep a punctuality. I booked morning 10.30 am, carpenter told me. 2 pm, I Said ok, but now they told me my bike chease sir. What we can do now. I want today.
v good
Good App
urban company sarvices is so so great and hygien is so so good evry partner is folowing that thing thatswhy i am booked only and only urban company thank u so much urban companyüôÇ
good and useful for this padmic situation.
You are cheater you have cancel my booking and deduct my payment
Such an worst person you are keeping for cleaning, from the time the person came, he is asking me to upgrade the service and denied and went directly
Would be great if you include aquarium services also. Cleaning, water changing etc
nice
Worst worst experience..... The way this company is playing with customers are scary.
Thanks specially For Sachin sir
Made payment twice and it got deducted from my card bit refund initiated for only 1 payment. Customer service is very time consuming and poor with no resolution. Also no use of taking membership as services overall are poor. Taken 2 services
Good
excellent service
Service is good... But charges are very high for small fix or repair
Very Good. Hair and salon service is exceptionally done well.. kudos.
Pathetic Service and I was promised a service and was cheated after paying 2,000. They need at least 5 years to mature to attempt and give a decent professional Services.
A fantastic, unique concept company providing professionals in various disciplines. Wish them all the very best and hope they grow and expand to provide professionals in additional fields.
Worst services ever. Every time I assign a professional, and they reassign someone else. Tried complaining to customer service, and they just hang up in my face.
Very very bad Bad behaviour don't send like this person to the service
on time
Highly qualified experts help us get our requests attended. Extremely professional at work
Very professional person n well behaviour... Loved the way they cleaned. Even they cleaned up the space well
I am extremely happy with the service. I started to get help from here more than one year. And am very much happy with the service. If any kind of problem arise, they solve it out with another service... that's the great thing about Urban Company.
If we rated your employees you have to show your pro aap but u didn't show bcoz ur pro actually she did good hair cut and provide me good service aftr all u didnt show our feedback
Not able to download the app
Fast quick services available..has made life easy !!
Very useful
Very bad
Please urban clap app
Worst service ever butician is not well trained. Burnt my skin while waxing. Continously talking on fon. Very unprofessional behavior. When I complained about the girl the co. Is saying they will take strict action but I can see still the girl is working here in normal way without ny action by co. I am for sure I will not bd booking any service here in future
Slowly started looting the customers..new charges visitation fee ,Saftey and support fee and booking cancellation charges.. Started it's true colour..
Pathetic service provided, no professionalism by the customer care itself and no reliability
Cannot use a US number on the app. So it's useless for me while I am here in mumbai
All beauty relatwd services are good.. their app is really wonderful and informative
good aap
Good app
Great service
Actually I don't want to give this one star also. They accepted the booking, and never gave a track on it. The beautician was not appointed, there is no option to make a call to them. I got a call from the person after the time of booking was already exceeded. He never connected my call to senior management. The response is very poor.
Excellent job done by the executive...Really commendable job by Urban Company...
Excellent service. Technicians are highly experienced and does a good job and very polite.
Lot many gaps in this app. I have a long list. Service is fine. But app is not user friendly. For instance user can not enter other address location if he has service for other location then current location.
Very bad and shocking experience with UC app notice for my booked 2ndA.C. service.
Good app
Not good. Work not done satisfactory Ask the person to visit again.
Superb service by Sudha mam
Very good set of people are working with Urban Company. Highly professional and polite, had taken a couple of services through them and both were excellent
timely response and excellent service at convenience of home.
Company replies only if review is given on public platforms. The help section on the app is of no use. No complaint acknowledgement is received nor any one calls back. On the app it is written pls feel free to call us, but no contact number nor email is provided. Why don't you provide a support phone number. I paid in advance for a service, however the person didn't turn up. They have not refunded my amount since long.
good
I took the facility recently and it was great service. thank you Urban Clap
value to money for kitchen cleaning and ac service used...
Services are good and very economical, app is also very user friendly. Request to add service for sofa cum bed
good job
A great service but please offer a Calling Number or email or chat assistance. Could not find a way to renew UC membership on the app.
Third class experience
urban Company turns out to be a boon for a disabled girl like me who could not access the parlour physically.
Techinien subscription amount is very high,this amount effect to customer service.worrest company
Expecting more services from UC...
I have been denied service two times in a week. No proper response from the team. They just keep saying we'll try our best to find a professional and then cancel my request. When there is no professional available only, why do you provide us with slots and make us wait? very bad on your part.
service(water purifer)provideby them all are fake,without providing the service they can provide or not they climate for charges. Even without visiting of service man they collected the service and safety charges. They included the hidden charges also & even during cancelation they are not providing the full amount and they are saying it will not come to you.It's a complete un fair service. It don't deserve 1 star also.I am fully dispaointed with their service and I don't recommend to any one.
My experience was unpleasant if there is no beautician you should not give a slot she made me wait for 4 hour and she didn't come and block my call.i uninstalling this app.and please refund my money as soon as possible. Worst experience wid uc
Again with Beautician service they failed. Beautitians never visit on time and usually non responsive customer service. They are not at all bothered on resolution of the other services like plumber Professionals. They used to come as per their convenience they deny and charge extra money. Raised issues but they no satisfactory response is received.
I did hair cut today through UC. Service was excellent by the person. UC helps in getting these kind of good service. Thanks.
excellent application
Doesn't open at all
Delighted with the service
Nice job
good sarvis
Worst salon products and worst service...local parlours are better
Service are good but expensive compared to market.....So company should also think of customer pocket and affordability.. Really don't like the additional charges in name of safety. Please work to reduce cost so people will look frequently to book.
shilpaji was really good at work and it was speedily and clean too
Perfect service
VERY VERY POOR SERVICES. CANCELLED MY BOOKING DUE IMPROPER TIME SCHDULE. CAN'T ALLOWED ANY STAR.
3rd class service no number .. of calll center to call also
Bhut hi ghatiya app h, 2 week se book kr rha hu koi response ni h, na hi booking details milti h
super
Ptachtic &Horibble in charge hidden fees like visiting fee & safe fee. For fan capicitor change for two fans they charged 437 Rs. Is it fair ?if I add more 400 I would have buy a new fan . Totally upset with this hidden unessary charges . I am going to take this with consumer forum.......
Today , My washing machine was repaired by UC technician.No spare parts were used , I was charged Rs 450.I think I was overchrged . UC management should send technicians who follow proper billing procedure.
clean and neat work with more patience
Don't get trap.. they are bunch of idiots and work on making money for them self.. they don't care for their customers... this company should be banned from operating in our country... the modus of operandi for this company is take money earn interest and then if lot of complain return the money still they earn interest from bank...IDIOTIC Company...
very good service. very good professional
Best
Nicely set up app and good services. But app keeps shutting down during the booking process then there's an issue with online payment.
It was completely unpleasant experience had i asked local shopwala he could have easily solved it in 15 mins
Very bad experience in painting services
stress-free, mess free and clean painting job while staying in the house. well behaved and well trained painters. highly recommended for house or office painting.
There is no way to delete/cancel a Recurring Scheduled cleaning service and no customer service contact details in the app. They should allow users to cancel the whole schedule.
good job, very clean and neat work
Downloaded the app, and booked the service in less than 2 mins and trust me the sercixe guy came in 20 mins. I couldn't believe this superfast service. The guy pest control technician Sadiq helped a lot beyond his job to clean the kitchen work for us. Thank you!!! Many more services that I look forward to subscribe.
Very poor customer support & experience. Getting money in advance for annual service bookings for 2 services per annum but charging for 2nd service. Really cheating app. Check rating before proceeding this service.
Best for PARLOUR services
Address change option not available
hair cut service was superb
excellent team
excellent
Chor h sale service krne aate h or parts milte nhi inhe unprofessional and worst technicians not recommended at all
Fraud company
He was excellent in his work
Salon experience horrible
this app is not good.. they can conveniently cancel your booking without valid reason and also don't fall to their UC gold membership.. they are scam.. what is the point of getting all the 10% where they cancel your appointment easily. also, how can they offer the massage, if they only have 2 massage therapist available???
Excellent
Urban clap is good in Bhopal
Very bad
used it first time but happy with the service
I booked professional for beauty services. I paid to u not u paid me and their professional are very unprofessional and she is rude and using abuse words also...I have a recording. I will file a case against her. She dnt hv any authority to speak with me like this
ok
Happy customer of Urban Company.
Good service...
good service
Very poor service professional assigned kai baad bhi aane ko ready nahi hai...
excellent service from Urabn company
Very pathetic service..I booked call for refrigerator twice but both occasions technician was too arrogant as well as denied to visit..By stating reason videocon refrigerator is out dated also insisted for more money to execute visit...
I wanted to know why the water inlet pressure was less. I booked a free consultation with UC and with his expert guidance over whatsapp call I was able to remediate the pressure issue withing minutes. Had I approached my local repairer, it would have costed me atleast Rs 300 to Rs 400 but with UC's intelligent expert guidance I could do it for free. Also the cost of knowing about my washing machine filters is priceless
Very pathetic experience with cleaning professionals multiple times. Customer care is for name sake, they don't care about resolving persistent issues. Definitely not booking in the future, seeing others posting similar reviews as well.
On recent booking electrician assigned is very late and not at responding professionally. I m still waiting. Call back from UC also not working. 2nd bad experience with service from urban company. Suggest not to use their services.
Poor service. Booked geyser maintenance & cleaning service. Technician tells me he don't have chemicals needed for geyser cleaning and asked me to cancel service. If they don't have materials to clean items, what sort of service they are providing.
You guys hire unskilled people and they tried to looted customers. I had a very good impression about this app but today I am confirming that it's pathetic and very costly service. I will rather call local guys to complete the plumbing issue.
It's good that you don't have any major competitor in the market, because with your pathetic service, you won't be able to sustain one.
It was my 1st booking done by my friend on my behalf, and it was a nightmare...They didnot turn up for service booked for today and my money is struck...No response at all from any Team.. cal anyone let me know ??
Restricting myself to 1star as I Can't give 0 stars.. Extremely pathetic service. The Ads and promises are so deceptive. Just not worth falling into their marketing traps. Had bad experience 4 times out of 5 times. The only good experience was after an escalation of poor service for which company was forced to give a professional to fix the damage which the previous so-called professional had done. Customer support is extremely pathetic amd not reachable. please avoid.
My wallet cash of over Rs 600/_ is not reflecting now which is 0. How can cash paid by me for any unrendered service be squared off. Highly unethical
Nice
Bakwassss App, Paise Khao... Customer Care toh pura ka pura Labaad hai..
Worst experience no time sense and don't even bother to intimate the client. It's not professional it's unprofessional service...
Very bad.even when the booking is done and scheduled they decline at the last moment, upsetting the entire planning of the customer.very very unpredictable service provider
expensive
very quick and clean service provider
I want to payment cash delivery is not accepted my AC servicing I want

Lies about UC plus membership. While buying it will say you save 20% and then after you do it suddenly changes to 10%. Website and app say different things when logged in and when logged out.
it's scam there is no one person not given 5 star atleast 4 it's meanse why people going to fool dont use this app
Very good
Good service
loved there massage therapy,I thoroughly enjoyed it...it was an awesome feeling
Awesome service quality , I booked A/C service and everything went on smoothly .
Hi.. computer dust cleaning available? Pls reply
above expectations
Pathetic experience. Complete nightmare. I have booked painting job for my house which was due on 18th Sep'2021 but professional didn't turn up and no response from him. Cherry on the top is professional and sales associate (Surveyor) stopped picking call and not informing what I have to do further. Tried to raise my concern atleast 20-25 time through their customer care but no one is responding there as well. And all this when i have already paid 35% amount in advance.
very prompt service
I booked tv technician for tv repair. The technician cheated me. He took 3500 rupees from me for 279 rupees work. When I downloaded invoice of service, the bill was only 279. But he took 3500 rupees. A Month after Same issue in tv. He is not coming to check it. I want refund.
Had called for pest control but still cockroach are there It's not worth paying 947 rs it's waste of money Very bad experience I request please don't use urban company For pest control especially cockroaches
good
One click destination for my leisure day
Great
excellent service .The guys were efficient n very well behaved .I m satisfied with the service..thank you urban company.
Poor service. Assigned partner is not picking up the phone and zero response from the company. Worst experience. Pls avoid to take service from them.
Very bad professionals and poor quality service... And I am unable to share feedback via the app
368 rupees just to apply M-seal that too bought by me? Disappointed..... overcharged
The services are going bad with time. Once you've gone for the membership they will take you for granted. Also please check the vaccination certificates of the professionals assigned. In pretext of sending vaccinated individuals company will not ensure following timely vaccination protocols followed by their therapists. Cancelling last minutes is common too.
excellent service
service is good !
It is extremely sad that parlour services need to be cancelled not once but twice in a row for not assigning a professional. Sincere request if the company does not have the capacity, please do not take the booking as bookings are done quite in advance and time is wasted waiting for the service. Extremely disappointed for such unprofessionalism.
Highly unprofessional
It was wonderful exp. Service give by anita's ji
Fake company
Very happy with the service.
Very useful services and information
excellent professional
Very worst, plumber came to the place and cancel the service.
Prices are exorbitant. Services provided are compartively mediocre. Would not recommend it
Good
very nice cleaning by Chintu kumar and his partner. They were very professional.
Good experience
My pest control for termite treatment was carried out on around 10 JULY 2021 and a warranty of 3 mo ths was given. The termites have started again and i cannot see an option to contact urban clap. Urban clap is trying to just cheat me or what. I paid full amount for the treatment and now i cannot even see the pest control option. What should i do. Shall i go to court or shall i just keep on knocking urban company's door without any action.
Expensive,not satisfied with prices even in my first order, didn't get any discounts
The worst service I've ever experienced. First they'll confirm the booking and then at the time of their visit they'll tell you that the professional isn't available .we can try for tomorrow. Pathetic is the word I've for this kind of forgery. I hope this app shuts down
Booked service but no body turned up and i was told that all professionals are busy. I did not put any time contraint and asked them to send the professional any time of the day. Still nobody came and my whole Sunday got spoiled as i cancelled all the programs and kept waiting. Then my booking got cancelled without my consent. I raised a complaint and i was told that whenever i book next i will get an SME. But they did not keep their words. Next time no SME came. Highly disappointed.
good work
I don't why u are taking extra charges, on the name of Covid 19. Everyone knows there safety precaution. 10-20rs. Is enough directly rs.59. That thing I didn't like...
One stop solution for everything.
awesome
Big time fraud. Even on buying 12 months membership, you do not get discount on your next booking. This fraud company just takes membership charges from you stating 12month membership will get you good discounts but you do not get any discount. On calling the professional they say nothing is in their hands. There is no customer service no. available where I can raise my concern and issue. Frauds ..give me my membership money back. It seems I need to post it on social media
Been using Urban Company's services since last 3 yrs now and they are surely the best, no other app compares to the degree of services they offer. No month passes by wherein I havent taken UC services. The range is huge & professionals are apt. Would recommend it to everyone.
In Feb, Compressor of my refrigerator was replaced by urban clap technician. Now it is failed again. Another urbanclap technician asked me to contact your customer care to get bill of compressor from previous technician. But I am not able to get his contact details or your customer care contact details..... Later on urban clap team contacted me & helped to resolve my query
Wonderful
Very good service üëç
Not only are your "professionals" rude & unprofessional, but so are your customer service! I have filed a complaint for an unfinished job a week ago, two customer service (one called for a feedback on your service) promised a call back & to date no one called! (I tried to call several times, lines are busy). I bet complaint is marked as resolved on your system! It just hit me that the only time I was satisfied with your service was when you were sending professionals from another company. Shame!
Good
convenient option, very relaxed enjoyed my beauty session.
Very helpful app.
Very expensive spare parts..you get them cheaper in outside market.
Urban company is good for massage but not good for AC services an RO these guys are very unprofessional inke AC wale ne Mere set top box per Pani Gira Diya very third class technicians
No one taking responsibility after booking weather the service person is going on time or not ,we called him many times he is saying 10 min 15 min its been more than 1hr no one is taking calls.its pathetic u people are cheaters
I booked an yearly subscription but I am now struggling for an hour to avail that subscription.
Worst services provider. UC men do comenon time, and after cancellation due due to delay, UC charge 30 rupees as cancellation gees.
Nice and useful app
I don't understand why your customer care is that poor. I mean you used to be good. Well my experience... So i got extremely poor service from one of your girls and i complaint about that. I got a call back and was offered same service again and was told that whenever you want to take the service just reopen your case. I was really happy with the customer service experience. But guess what since a month I'm trying to reopen the case trying to get in touch with customer service. But result is 0.
good application
nice work
Worst service provider...
Poor service got my ac service done thru their team, 1st tilld ate after 3 months proper bill not given inspite of repeated complaints logged. Money taken 3300 but bill raised for rs 350. 2nd just after 3 months got complete AC still shows the same problem and they are asking to book new complaint and get it done, as per them after every 3 months AC service of approx 3300 need to be done. No use of raising complaint with their call centre also, pathetic services from urban company
Good
Amezing
Booked for the bathroom cleaning. After seeing the bathroom, the service boy started bargaining. After the cancellation they are showing only half refund. The service in Patna is very poor. Needs improvement.
good app
Extremly awful experience in TV repair. These guys charged 7000 for TV repair, but the TV stpped working again within their warrenty period. When asked to fix, these guys got my TV picked up, but now neither fixing my TV, nor calling me to update. Technician says urban company not giving approval to fix. I hv written to UC multiple times , but am not even getting a call back. And there is no number to call on. Pathetic service! It has been 15 days already and my TV is still with technician.
This is the 2nd time it's happened to me. I had a booking for yesterday, paid for it in advance ofcourse, the professional did not turn up(apparently they have a problem with sticking to the address you provide). So when you call them for half an hour after the scheduled time, they will be in another part of town. Then they refuse to come to the real address, I contacted helpdesk, they were supposed to get back in 60mins but I still haven't heard from them. Pathetic service.
Idiotic customer service..only callback option is present and they never call back
It's Relvotiunary idea well executed
Absolutely useless user interface of the app. When selecting Kitchen Cleaning Services, it says utensils removal is included and when professional arrives, he says it's not. And neither can he include that at an additional cost. While utensils removal is a part of home cleaning services!! What was the UX designer smoking while creating these pages and mapping services?? All they can do well is Salon services that too at the cost of exploiting professionals.
Had quite a number of medi-pedi appt under UC. Overall is quite good although sometimes they were late. Will still continue with UC if WFH extend.
This app is new way of scamming people. Robbing small amounts from customers without providing service and refunds. We can't even call customer care
So, Their service depends on which state your in, for example, Delhi the service standards are good but I tried them in Indore and it's unbelievably low, training to therapist is non standard, and simply no standard of service I recently faced a problem where therapist was taught something totally non standard, it was utterly disappointing and a total total waste of money CANT BELIEVE THAT SAME ORGANIZATION CAN HAVE SUCH HUGE DIFFERENCE OF STANDARDS
Excellent
Service isno
Ok services, I took beauty services. Its not upto the mark and charges are very high. Can get better options at local salons. UC has gone to dogs now, they don't bother about customer service. Highly unprofessional.
Basically local boys ..has not much experience . I aclled for sofa cleaning, they try to esacpe. Next called bathroom cleaning..they are good to clean the cleaned things...not dirty ...No good to invest money on some services.
great service
One of the worst service, any one who bookings please don't waste time. I scheduled for washing machine and refrigerator. After 5 days they provided the service
VRY BAD AAP DO NOT DOWNLOAD
Worst Experience
I am one of the member of UC but not able to book service nor is able to contact UC...every time i try to book it flashes the message that no professional is available to seeve me.
I tried Elysian wine firming facial on 21st Aug 21. I got serious skin infection and I am taking treatment from dermatologist. I am worried what will happen to my skin. I want compensation for the product used on my skin and mental trauma that I am suffering right now.
Goob experience
Just bought a membership, but it is not reflecting in the app. Please fix this asap, so that I can go ahead with booking a service.
Superb and fast service... Nice and well behaved staff..
I love urban clap
Totally disappointed.
Good
Service is very bad
I was in need of cleaning my main dranage of house, which was blocked. But this people have no service like that....... Improve your service, and add more of it.
I'm very satisfied with the service .but i request you to please add more services for Raipur Chhattisgarh.
Now everything running well.scs
This is the worst experience I had in my whole life. I booked a mattres cleaning and they didn't assign anyone at all & then they reshuduled it to the next day the same thing happened they promised me they would come by the next day 3 pm but then the same thing happened.Please stop Giving hopes to people when u can't do the Job.The customer care number is also always busy & the call dosent get connected.So I can say that just stopping making fool out of people and yourself.
great service
Most horrifying service ever Plz don't use them. . Just waste of time awaiting for them to turn up and than all they have to give u is an.apology..
Excellent service
It seems your app is developed by the new comers as it can stop working anytime and only allow user to play the game on it while not working. Also, it can also not refund the amount for the cancellation of services. Pathetic experience. Moreover, you guys have no customer care and person can only connect via app and if app is not working then communication is closed.
Disappointed, never turned up on bookings
Booked a service for my LED tv. Very poor support from both service partner and urban company executive. There is no option to contact urban company directly. Had wait for the call back. Inspite of repeated complaints till date there is response or action from urban company. And now it is almost 20 days and TV is with the service partner. Service partner even stopped replying and not picking calls.
Worst experience ever
Poor service for salon for men, poorest response to customer dissatisfaction, hollow promises.
price is little bit high
They are using worst chinese consumables during their services. Recently booked RO service (Water Purifier) from UC and below is my experience. CHEAP CHINESE RO MEMBRANE USED..... Amazed to see, UC promoting these worst quality products !!!! Recommended and commited brands of Membrane by UC are Dow, Pentair, TFC and CSM, conveyed over email.
Time waste money waste
It's very nice experience
excellent service üëå
I had booked salon service in day time according to it will finished before 7.30 but professional not assigned for project. Then UC service center contact me and request to reschedule it. But why. I scheduled it within preferred time and day then why should I rescheduled it for UCs mistake. Really Disappointed this time. Not expected this. Atleast give us gift cards or discounts for UCs mistakes. U ll charhe 50 rs extra for safety purpose then u must pay penalties also.
Horrible, from the behavior of the mechanic to the total output of work. From Horrible to Horrendous experience leaves a feeling of being cheated from top to bottom.
No one company
Hassle free services for anything and everything. Personnel coming over are also professional and understand and do their job as per specifications. No surprises or additional / hidden costs involved.
Bloddy cheaters and they are not professional at all, only for cleaning bathroom they are capable.and other appliances works they are allocating a cheap local guys not at all professional at work and if in any case, there urban partner damaged customer property they will simply escape from problem by passing days like saying our team is working on it I'll get back a call regarding your damage and trouble caused . Finally, they non trustworthy and 100% not fitted to service based application
Good service and on time professionals
Always prefect for me
don't think over...just download this app....and it will be heplful for u...and make ur life so easy
For kitchen cleaning the professional reschedule 3 times and then denied the service. They want to do private work but not collaborated with urban .professional wants to do easy work and charges are high Poor service
I didn't get my refund
Too OVERPRICED! I literally paid ‚Çπ2200 for a service including equipments, which would've cost me ‚Çπ1100 if I had simply called my local service guy. I got charged double just because I used an app to call someone to get it fixed! Such a shame!
A highly un professional company doesn't stand by their commitments. Doesn't respond to query. Had given the task to paint my house and have already done part payment but they are used to assign a person for the task. Despite followup there is no revert.
I am very much
no word to describe the best friendly job execution by Vignesh team for installation of split A/c. thumps up
Worst company... Unskilled professionals no regularity... No punctuality... Won't respond to the calls after getting the money... The works will be left half done
No customer care number in the app or website. Revised the billing amount for the same task and has not processed the refund for more than 15days.
Highly disappointed with the service. Raised complaint about painting quality on 6 sep. Till today 17 sep not resolved. Not even responding in proper way.
Very good service
Sahi h
Excellent app to book carpentery services.. very professional people
excellent work
Worst company service ever
Awesome
They will never reach in time!.
Fully commercial app development done to loot from partners by providing leads.its a big big business for them by sitting and enjoying ii n office
Very bad experience
Excellent app
Wonderful and relaxing. Amanpreet was professional.
Worst app and experience for me. I have uninstalled it. I got rashes and pimples all over on my face by their facial service. It has been 2 weeks still those pimpes donot vanish from face. I raised the complaint also but they connected once with me and after that no response from their side. This app is only making money by promoting the products which profit them. They are using worst products. I will not recommend this app to anyone and I make my closed one aware about their scam also.
charges are high
Nice experience
Before I can even book a service, there is no customer care number. If someone has any queries or something to ask what he/she is supposed to do? In India it doesn't work like that. There has to be a dedicated toll free number for any general queries.
excellent response and well versed technicians.
Booked bathroom cleaning service, they use so strong chemicals that my tiles got discolored and no one is there to listen to your complaint.
I would give a 0 star if that's an option.
Thought of downloading the app by seeing the 4.6 starred reviews and then I read the reviews, words are not matching the actions UrbanClap...don't get ahead of the customers.. P.S. not installing the app.
well Done guys.. I am very much happy with your service but price is on the higher side
Good compeny
Opted Paint work from UC. Within 3 months, there are bubbles in celing. When complaint to UC, nobody visited to see yhe problem. Just looking at pictures, told its my own fault and plaster has a crack. Atleast UC should have visited before making such statement. They treated well till I made payments. No engagement post that.
Bad experience...They have cancelled the booking without informing
Good experience with Urban company salon service at Raipur
We will get exactly opposite what they promise
you should have to give all other services also like transportation like movers and packers. Also have to provide services to boisar and virar you will get more and more profit in this area like boisar( maharashtra) as there is big population and didnt get any local service so you will get more services in this area.....
By using this app to get any service you are wasting your time. baddest company I booked part time cleaning at 5 pm and nobody came without any follow up with me, after calling them so many times they told the cleaner can not come and the give me other appointment on 7 pm i have wait till 7.30 during that i was calling the cleaner (nobody try to follow up with me again) for 30 minutes her answer was only i am on the way !!! I have wait 2 and half hour for just clean my home !!!
Pathetic experience
It's not user friendly. I'm trying to find a contact to speak with customer care regarding my payment issue but there is no option to do that!!!
Didn't got any referral reward even after clicking on referral link.
Terrible service Booked for bathroom cleaning. Stains are as it is not even improved 5% charged the amount. Finally after complaining they were not ready to provide service again to clean simply asked for refund some amount and escaped. Worst service in Visakhapatnam. As per their conversion instead of improvimg service they were trying to save their brand image by refunding some amount to the customer. They wasted my time. Not yet all suggestable the service. Also im going to uninstall the App.
Very poor, pathetic customer service. I booked kitchen cleaning service on 7th September and paid 948 in advance. Emptied the whole kitchen and waited for the person to come but no one never called or came. No one picked any calls. On 11th September I received a call from Urban Company about the confirmation of the service. I told them to refund my money but till today no refund has been made.
Very, very dissatisfied with home painting service. Poor quality of materials and the masons have taken back unused inventory! The walls look whitewashed and not painted. They have cheated me to bits! The supervisor Rahul Roy requested for the painting service to be assigned privately to him at a lower cost. They diluted the paint and have taken away unused inventory, sure to be sold off in the market to make money. I do not recommend this company to anyone. Dont be cheated! Horrible!
Wonderful services
Unprofessional company
Horrible. I clean my bathroom better than their so called professional. My money was wasted
Urban company is only for rich people not for middle class chutiya bana rahe hai only with words.....read their plan then book them ....,..full scheme
I hat thik app
Very bad experience your company cheat me and fraud company plz do not install this aap and not Book service
Good
good professional work done. good job.
It is very easy to use and also useful app.. But why did you change the name? Urban Clap was a great name.. It sounded so awesome. Urban Company sounds BORING üòÑ
very helpful
Worst experience ever on first trial. After getting service I had races on skin and burning.
very handy app for daily needs...
The personnel visited was helpful
EXCELLENT
I m so happy
Very bad service. They came fir cockroach removal but cockroach not gone. Very bad
I invite your technician for my gyser for only sevice . After service the technician change several parts but after 45 days till date the gyser is not working condition. Now the company customercare also block my SMS . Now I couldn't contract the urban company. Now I lost huge money and my gyser.
Main apna washing machine banwaya tha. Jo ke properly bana nahi. Main ne bar bar call kiya problem ke liye. Un logo ne sirf yahi bola ke kal aata hu aaj yahan busy wahan busy hu. Aap video bana ke bhejo. Aur mera warranty period isi tarah end ho gaya. Ab bolte hai out of warranty hai. They fooling people by ad. Don't call them for any issue.
ridiculous the carpenter himself cancelled the call 3 times first and there are no strict action against this then after a lot of harassment they assigned a carpenter
Excellent experience in the newly launched Home Salon Services! Agent was efficient, well behaved, hygienic and friendly üëå Way to go Urban Company! Many more kudos to come üôå
Khaleem delivered wonderful painting for our new home
Excellent service prompt and professional
Irresponsible electricians....took a fan for repair day before yesterday and still not returned.Never expected this from Urban Company.Better to shift to some other service and save your time and money.
Bad
Not provide any kind of options
Pathetic.
The Service provide was very good..Hygenic..Polite n patient...Punctual...In all everything was good
very useful
Very unprofessional and not even half the value for the money they charge. I'd not recommended this app to anyone. I booked full house cleaning, Sundeshwar Kumar Sahu was appointed for this job. He arrived very late and was not even ready to do the complete job. They send incompetent people to do the job and charge cancellation fees. If this app wants to improve it should fire people like Sundeshwar.
nice and quick service
Awesome service.
They won't do service and demand for the money please dnt use this
I have paid in advance for the monthly cleaning service and never got the cleaner. All lines busy and when they finally connect they tell you someone will call in 24h which is unbelievable considering you want to complain that the maid never arrived. They (the customer care) say that they are not the concerned department for this complaint. Internally, the coordination is terrible unless of course you want daily cleaning where you're going to have to pay additionally. I want a refund.
Fantastic experience
Excellent service . Well mannered , polite personnel who come for the service. Recommend UC to all my friends and family Thank you
very average.overhyped.give v ordinary service which you can get at one third the price. most of the high ratings are because the clients are requested to give high ratings. PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE WASTING YOUR MONEY.
Good company
They don't have a cart option where I can keep adding services. If I happen to exit the app midway it all disappears
Excellent
Really professional service
Very costly.
Chennai- Never book an AC service via UC. They'll do a pathetic job, which will fix the issue for 4-5 weeks and it'll be having the same issues again. However, you'll be charged heavily for each visit. Validity of 90 days is a joke
Good
everything you want you can get
Company charges are too much ..
Payment portal is bad, plus after booking morning slots, 3 days in advance they can't schedule a personal in time, pathetic response time
Horrible experience getting house painted. They are good for other services but avoid for house painting work
Gd
Very Good and fast service.
Fake cashback offer.200 rs cashback if offered by them and I got only 28 rs. I felt like I have been fooled by urban clap.
Surendranagar Gujarat me service available nahi plz provide karaiye.
Good aap
I lodged complaint for my service request and though it has not been resolved, the request has been closed as "Job Completed". Requested for call back multiple times but no response!!! Professional not clear of what is offered by UC in service package and won't proceed with service until UC Support Team confirms the customer package, which they never did! Lack of understanding between UC & Professional, customer has to waste time following up! Job partially completed, still shows "Completed"!
Very poor service They just want your money Nothing else
Worste technicians inthe app they will say I will come to home,but they will not come or call at alla waste of time
Poor Service ...no customer care ..unable to connect
Very unprofessional and delaying in service , my wooden flooring in room was damaged during the bathroom cleaning but still no rectification, very sad.... Customer care is least bothered
Awesome Thank you whole team
do not employ thieves
at the accurate time
Very good platform for booking any service... very nice professional attitude...liked it very much
Good experience
Ordered a full home cleaning. Denied by sub vendor and Urban Company suppored that.
They provide the worst honey wax for client dealing that heats so fast and it is so painful and hurtful to get waxed...it seriously burns your skin
They charge 5dh extra if u wana pay COD n dats very bad im not intrested in this APP if they dont remove dat fee dis online payment always crash very disppointed üëéüëéüëé
Good services at our door step. Would highly recommend
Nice service

Degraded services and products
rate card can be better
excellent service
great service provider.... all are professional
not able book services always it shows fully occupied. them.what is useful to install the app check always.
Very bad experience, it's been more than 10 days appliance taken for repair customer care is utter waste they are not updating status and calling back. I will never again use

very Good
Excellent experience from urban clap thank q urban clap. Your pets control service is too good.
I'm old user for me they are not showing available slots for next one week but for a new customer who just started using they r showing available slots from today. I'm also a pro member. How can I rely on urband clap with ushc behaviour
Took RO service a while ago. The guys used local filters with the company name stickers. And charged as per the company rates. Fake people.
Biggest fraudsters, cannot resolve a simple issue even after multiple followups and after providing screenshots and screen recordings, just keeps saying we have referred your issue to our team, does not even refund the money. Please do not have any business with them.
‡Æ™‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Ææ‡Æü‡ØÅ ‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æ©‡Æø
it was a very very great experience ...!! I would suggest my friends and near Dear ones too always go for Urban company they are the best üëå
good
Disgusting
I called for sofa cleaning in Pune so profesional. Urban clap is really so useful and the employees are amazing
the professional Pooja Kumari was a polite and respectful girl with amazing skills of work. it was my first experience with urban company and i must say I ll be booking them always,,,üëçüëçüëç
Hair cut is not done by the asked person. but Mr. Anjan did well and maintained good sanitation as well
Uc aur uc partner app alag kyu ? Kyuki partner rating kam karega to costumer ko pata chal jaayega ki kaam rating kam kyu hue
urban. company must have call centre contact for queriwa
It feels like a scam. I placed for a washing machine repair request and made the payment via google pay. The amount was deducted successfully but it showed that payment failed. But the weird part is that they acknowledge receipt of payment and says will refund in a week. Absolute waste of time!
Seems very expensive services
Don't book chef service he not coming and customer care services not response
Very bad experience as a first time user for Urban Company. No discount for first time user, even your coupon codes are not working. Prices are bit high. My experience with UC... 1. The first professional did not have proper products regarding service. Booked another professional 2. The second professional accepted and called me to confirm and also told me she will be late by an hour and at the time of service she declined for service. Very bad!!!
Horrible experience for plumbing service. Completely commercial. No customer orientation. You cannot find a customer care service also. Booking charges are different from actual charges.
Ridiculous app very bed service. I took day off to change my mcb, i scheduled 1.30pm, i am waiting but no body appoint yet and its evening already
Your Profession person denied to Visit, Totally disappointed with Urban Clap Service. Big issue as per your company charge to customer and not providing services.
Thought of downloading but after seeing the reviews..... üòÇ
Excellent service
Best aap
Super bad service. Don't ever take any AMC service from them. They will not come back after there first or second visit. Moreover when there customer care representative doesn't call you back.
Nice app to get house hold works done without any hustles.
Booked deep cleaning services for my toilet, and was assigned a rude person who refused to clean anything and just wished to spray disinfectants.
Absolurrsrress free
Keeps crashing. I have been trying to book a service since yesterday, but the app just keeps crashing. And top of that there is no way I can connect to a representative from the company to get the issue resolved. This is sheer madness.
good
Worst experience ever, waste of time I suggest please don't book any service
good service provider
AMAZING üëè
good one
Some services are good, some are average. Service cost is very high comparetively to market price.

Extremely poor customer exp. Hidden fees in every options. And mandatory cancellation fee when service cancelled due to genuine reason with 5 mins. Designed to cheat customera.
Exceƒ∫ent service. I had utilized their service for house cleaning and hair cut. Highly professional and follows safely precautions in the present situation
very good service.The professional who came was very good.
Since last 6 days complaint has been lodged. But the problem has not been resolved. Infact the person who came to repair damaged the full washing machine . Complaint was only for spinner part and after his attempt to repair that washer has also stopped working. And now after reminders also no one is looking into matter. Very very bad experience.
Haircut by Sajid Excellent.
Your entire business runs on the functionality of your app,at least keep that running? It has numerous glitches and is extremely slow. How am I supposed to even book any appointment?
Worst app.
Very good service. They were promptly in time
I have raised the Ro water purifier request and am on AMC, but the service person took the material for replacement but didn't come back. There is no response from support since two week. Taking RO AMC services from UC is utter waste.
Very pathetic experience...not using orginal products!!!! disappointed
Very bad experience,my appliances was damaged. They provide duplicate parts. My two appliances was damaged.
Bad
Exelent
Very bad aap land aap hai
Such a bad experience with different technicians for the same issue. Very unprofessional and untrained workers. Damaged my AC after charging so much more than other technician. If you are very lucky then rarely some good technician might come otherwise most are just bad and unqualified for the job.
Doesn't work on oneplus 6
It is always a good experience with urban clap. Ab wih deep cleaning ho, sofa and chair cleaning, AC service, salon at home.
There are flaws in the app. I purchased a package of 4 therapies but am unable to book 2nd service. The app has no real " contact us" option. Made a complaint and kept trying to get it resolved thru app but am unable to do so. No one calls me back tho i used that feature to ask for call back
Urban company is very worst it has very very road side guys as proffitionals to service us I face very worst experience with Urban company it collect commission based broker company will not recommend this company so don't go with Urban company
good
Very professional service provider
Best service every time..
My skin got burn after taking professional services. After raising complaint team contacted and told me to get consultation from doctor and post that they will reimburse all my expense as my services covered under insurance. However since yesterday I am trying to contact urban clap but they are not responding. I will launch complaint against UC plus I will discourage people to get services from UC. Highly disappointed.
Well done
These people refuse bookings at the last moment. Horrible experience. The customer executives are of no help. The ac installatiin process took more than 6 hours and in the end they damaged my ac. I have been trying to raise the issue again and again. Still no help.
Good service.. since I use it without fail every month I wish I get discounts üòä
Worst service ever..even after multiple follow up and email..nobody bother to respond.since I don't have options to give negative star..I .forced to choose 1 star..don't waste your time and money by availing there service.you will have to regrate later

Teachnical person are well equipped
great team... spotless and clean job...
satisfactory sevices provided in any case, related to lifestyle in one app, highly recomended
Patatic service provided. Cheating customers.
Cash payment of 848 rs and invoice send of amount 209rs only.......generating less amount invoice..cheating with customer and government
Hopeless services.. Never consider urban clap they don't offer any customer service.. I trusted them and went for a saloon service. Post the service my face was burnt with marks all over and I had to see a doctor to undergo a treatment. I even filed a complaint with urban clap team but they have not responded or given me any resolution. They are not at all trust worthy and I sincerely request each one of you to not take any services offered by them. Very bad customer care/service.
Etni ghatiya company h Technician ki koi owkat nahi h es company m Jab bi man hota h technician ko penalty laga dete h chahe uski koi galti bi na ho Ab to revisit aane pr bi 50 credit deducte kar lete h
This company is cheating the customer... Not useful at all... And please don't post auto reply
Worst experience
We repaired our TV with service charge around Rs 10000, but there have been 3 different problems post service. Now contacting their support service but no response yet.
Exclent
Very bad
Worst app ever ,i booked for a purifier service and professional cancelled being said that they don't provide service for brand purifiers and it's been 16 days today i haven't received my refund
Pathetic app, I am unable to claim warranty from my app. My appliance is not working anymore.
Tlme to switch
Good
This is a total fraud company...so harsh and rude technicians who cancel their bookings at last moment..worst experience please please avoid them if u care about ur blood pressure not getting increased all of sudden..
Nice and great service.. Awesome üëç
Excellent service.keep it up
Not good
Best Service
Very Bad Experience For Me
Cheats. Urban Company's ethics are crooked and their morals are corrupt. Stop using their services. They promised me to get my warranty claim processed after their service partner broke my glass dining table. But they stopped responding to my messages and call back requests. This is not fair. Who will pay for my damages? The reason I hire them is for facilities like this. Now, if they want to behave like local labour then I might as well go to local hires.
Very helpful to complete electrical, plumbing work as it is hard to follow up local plumbers/electricians
Very poor service, when i complained at customer care, they assured me that they will get on touch with me soon, but many days have passed nothing has been done.
Very goodüëç
Install ho rha jb tk reviews padhe phir dimaag kharaab ho gya aur install hote hi uninstall kr diya
The app isn't installed on my phone but I keep getting these OTPs every now n then
company worker disturb the beautician while servicing the customer...
I am unable to make booking. After selecting the service when I click on summary, buffering started and it keeps going on.
Nixe
ye company technation ke saath frod karta hai
Great experience
Bery bed
Worst service I have faced today The technician visited and informed wrong defect. Now the geyser is not at all working. He himself canceled the booking and took 250 rs and said refund will be initiated in 1 hr but later I realized he is a cheater. Worst service Don't prefer please
There r lot of service which is not available in my location....in d advertisement u should mention where all d full services available.....u r only fooling us
Not working
Pathetic. People cancel their booking at thr time of they were supposed to arrived. Never use this app
The executive assigned will ask for more money and say u have to re-evaluate the entire job sheet. Can work in the money u paid
Very poor service. Booked and the person told me to cancel it 20 min earlier. Now booking not there till 2 days. I came home from work for getting the service. No one from the company has called or rescheduled as it was a cancellation from their end. Very unprofessional.
I am a regular user of the app was happy till now, however UC has messed my paint project. Worst thing even after 8 hours no one from UC is resolving the mess. 1st day of the project is over and I have not received the material yet. For last 8 hours the paint supervisor is try to fetch the stuff without any luck. UC team seems to be deaf no one is taking the responsibility to resolve the issue. Best part is the surveyor has switch off his phone. Seems UC is not matured, so should take small job.
Cheating company hai UC non qualitity service delivery
Beautician are denjying or coming not on time.
This review is not about the app but of the charges levied by the company for services. Due to lack of knowledge of people urban company and also others are overcharging customers for compressor gas that is filled in air conditioners. the cost of the gas is 480 as on 13-09-2021 and they are charging 2200 for the same. they paying less to the service men and overpricing materials which should be sold on actuals. I challenge them to contest this feedback and hope people educate themselves about these things and not pay blindly. 458% Profit selling Gas procured from the market per sales call. If you still engage with them then happy making holes in your pocket. Also Haircut services are another level of thuggery altogether.
Costly
Worst response......they won't guide you properly........ waste of money n time
very good service
I am very unhappy with the service.... I had guests coming to my house so booked cleaning services in this app and the professional denied the service in the last minute. I contacted urban company and they were also not able to assign another professional at the same date.... Very very poor service... Will not recommend urban company to anyone....
Brilliant services.. fully satisfied.
I paid for my service but this site show me that the amount is pending.And I cannot contract with that professionalist. I can't booking any service too..
make a call and get rid of tension
Very bad cheating Baaz company
Unprofessional- either they reschedule or they are very very late for service. Aarti sahu (beautician) suggested to go for roll on wax instead of honey wax. She peeled off my skin at 7-8 places, it is unbearably painful. During the procedure I told her about the burning sensation but she kept ignoring. I thought just like normal wax it will hurt a bit and go away. But next day my hands were red and a peeled layer of skin could be seen. They don't properly train their employees.
My refund is yet not credited. No response from CS.
They keep deleting my review. So I will keep updating the review everytime they delete it.
Really a great app for many families who can required a assistance for their home needs
Very bad aap not working properly urban company is not resolved issue and cheating customer uc only hungry for money and money
Continually stuck on the address confirmation screen
Good app for daily needs from plumbing to massage. Easy to use and user friendly
After taking membership of 299 rs I am extremely happy
U will regret after availing the service. Waste of money and time.
Had a pest control for cockroaches last month with 2visits m very disappointed with uc there are many cockroaches that I find moving around in kitchen bathroom hall like how it was before the pest control....it seems the spray gel didn't work out...
I have been using this app for a few years now and the one word which describes my experience aptly is "wonderful" ..
1. They don't have customer care number even if they have am sure its hidden. 2. Executives usually won't turn up if you call them through app THEY WON'T ANSWER most of the time 3 I complained through app they just gave me a missed call if I call them it says all agents are busy and it's again routing back to help center in app which is useless. it's been 2hrs am still waiting for someone to visit me or call me with some update. - Urbanclap need to invest in hiring more ppl to provide quick svc
Owesom
Have booked water purifier service with sundar gupta, worst service he gave with in a week we got an issue
I Would Request Everyone To Stop Looking Here And There For You Local Needs ONE POINT SOLUTION FOR ALL YOUR DOMESTIC NEEDS # URBAN CLAP #URBAN COMPANY.
Trustable app . Good technicans have been provided
Excellent Cleaning
Worst customer service. They aren't refunding my money.
Scam
Worst experience ever, washroom cumod's flush pipe and water gun have been damaged n washroom has not been cleaned properly, I am going to uninstall this application and also suggest my friends and colleagues to never use this app again
All are cheater in this company no refund no call back no answer from any end, they just make you fool and let you suffer
I booked air-condition cleaning. The Mistry came late 40 minutes. After that asking for extra money. Such a rude and unprofessional.
Great work! Love the work of the technicians provided by urban company
front condesar are not so cleaned
3 attempts to book the service, it keep loading at the payment page for more than 5min. Please fix your apps.
It's a lovely app. With great professionals.
Salon service questinable The person assigned didn't turn up. mostly all persons call before scheduled time but something needed to be tightened up
Experienced 2 times and both the time had a worst experience. Want to speak with customer executive but their are no details available in application to connect with them.
Urban technician didn't solve the problem of my samsung digital inverter AC
I need daily or few days in a week car cleaning service at a reasonable rate by urban company. At around 300-350 per month. Urgently required!
Worst
best in everything üòé
Unable to login
Professionals especially electricians and ac demand more else ok
Pathetic app. Beauty professional will switch off their contact numbers right before appointed time. So that u r not able to track them. There is no support from customer service. No online support, they will take ages to call back.
The brand is good but if u got any issue they are not willing to assist u. I got the waxing done and now I am suffering with skin issues and there is no call or concern for reimbursement.
Mast app hai, use karo
Very high price of deep cleaning
v good team on field timely and good service
outstanding & honest service
Good well experienced professional. Took special care of leaving behind neat and clean space.
Professional never come and cancels last minute on peak days!
Worst service...damaged AC
Worst service
Pls don't go with this service worst service fool the people, not giving proper response unable to reach the customer care and they send vendor all fraud people..... Pls don't use this service. Helpless.
After two days confirmed booking... executive called &sir please change date ..
Yesterday my RO stopped working, was giving a noice, water started leaking and no outlet of water was there. I booked an appointment, today the technician came and found that the motor was damaged,filters were gone and were seconds/reuse type... Prior in month of May technician named Raman came for the same issue told me to change motor,filter ,AS and what not ...he charged about 3500/- from me. This just misleading customers and replacing with poor second hand parts.This reflects poor ..
Absolutely pathetic experience with professionals cancelling last minute and no replacements provided by the company. Will definitely not use the app for salon services in the future.
Very goodüëç experience with urban company
The most unprofessional service provider have zero management service
I had asked for trail visit for the monthly package and choosed an offered time, later they asked for confirmation, I did amd no one show up, I called them and texted the support, and 3 hours later I got a call that they want to reschedule it, it was very frustrating, still I did rescheduled the visit as per his request, same happened again. No body came and they called me 3 hours after, but that time asking for feedback. You cannot depend on them or trust their word.
If I should get an option then I will give negative stars. Pathetic service, engineer came to my place for AC service and said that your indoor unit is ok and he serviced outdoor unit and left, AC cooling was bit improved now today after 35 days I felt AC was not cooling so I opened the indoor unit and it's not clean, I contacted support team they said book another appointment for your service and pay for it, so basically you need to pay every month for AC service if you are booking from UC.
good app for services
Mr. Sachin well done. very nice job keep it up. You have done extraordinary work.
We have booked and paid ikea furniture assembly services from urban clap. Partner simply denied the services and taken 1500 INR add on money to start the services; on and above we have paid the amount of 937 INR on app. Urbanclap customer care number is not available and they never call back. Their emergancy service number executives fraudly disconnects the line repeatedly by communicating that call up customer care.
I had a bad experience with Urban Company, price quoted/listed for Refrigerator PC board repair was too high. Unfortunately I came to know that after I took the service from UC, LG service providing replacement of PC board for same cost where UC quoted for repair. Not happy/untrusted from service cost point of viewüòü
awesome üëåüëå
Very worst company
Very bad customer service
Worst service and they charge too much
Nice app
Goine Pathetic in terms of customer service,very dissatisfied customer now
Very punctual and very well behaved staff. Care and cleanliness is very well maintained. After COVID-19 all the protocol are strictly followed. Now we can get all salon treatment at comfort and safety of our home.
Great app for anything and everything we would find hard to resolve in our non-native place. Just loved the service.
very professional n hassle free n customer friendly
some professionals are not doing good like you have booking the professionals are making reschedule and after that also they are not visiting the site ... because of this people the urban company is getting poor
Poor experience, the person did not come and for refund they denied by saying membership can't be canceled. The fact was member ship was given as promotion auto applied while checkout. I spent half weekend awaiting for professional and at ghe end 300 rupess lose, as return only frustrating calls from UC. Poor customer service Better to go for local known profession, at least it does not have hidden term and conditions
Not able to download
awesome paint service
courteous and excellent service by Ammar...came on time and the work was very good. very professional.
very good service nd very professional staff
good
Avoid
excellent
We can't book more than one service at a time. If one tries to book then we have the one booked before gets removed & one has to book again.
Worst customer service ever. For a service issue on Thursday, UC tried respond on Saturday.
Professional service, my first experience was good ! let's hope this continues.
Ver bad .... This is second time .... Professional not fixed to time .... I have uninstalled the app .. It's easy to go to a local barber
There is no option to check for your previous bookings. Also last time I booked extra service of AC but there is no option to track back the same. You have to pay money every time you book whether you booked earlier or not.
Pathetic experience! I booked a plumber for Jet spray and holder installation, but the plumber didn't bring proper equipments for the same, tried to charge me more for spare parts. And when I contacted Customer Support and asked them to send someone else as it was an emergency they didn't do it. They rescheduled for 5 hours later. Please don't use services from them, it's better to look out for local options or other apps. Highly Disappointed!
App is good but service is pathetic... They keeping all inexperienced employees.. Terrible experience..Beware if you are looking for good salon service..
really nice üëç
Never use it matter what. There technician denied my service, not to metion the service was prepaid and the money was never returned. The customer service will just make excuses when you call.
Good
You service executive not completed job and not picking my phone.
service was excellent and professional was trained .......
They say deep cleaning of washrooms and 3 day warranty. Even after repeatedly placing requests , they didn't bother to call back. There is no way to reach customer support directly.
Excellent Service thank you
good
Very unprofessional......I would not recommend anyone.
Never ever gonna use the app and their unprofessional workers
Very Professional
Great app for services. Prompt and professional.
This is my first experience, it'was horrible.. As there is no customer care support... Instead of wasting money on tv ads you people should spend money on improvement of your services like customer support and professionals credibility too... Their professionals were using foul words to UC... I am really dissatisfied with the service even I don't want rate for single star ‚≠ê but commenting purpose I have given one ‚≠ê.. üò°üò°üò°üò†üò†üò†

Worst service till now ur professional not arrived already 1.30 minutes completed we r waiting for service send me as as possible
highly recommend Sabaintazar Ansari. very soft spoken n polite and took good care while trimming and shaving for my 92 year old dad. God bless him üôè
A Great Experience....
Unreliable at times.
Awesome service
pathetic services..kept waiting for 2 days for scheduled services..did not happen..had used my credit points which are also lost and money paid for booking..
Looks like they are very good at scheduling the work.. But they don't follow up if the customer has a complaint. I have taken fill home cleaning, so called professional came withoutfloor cleaning machine. When he confirmed work is cometed we saw full satines left over in both the bathrooms, worst part is even after complaint Urban is not bothered to respond. Even after follow up no one is responding. They all are liars. Pathetic people, mistakes can happen but no reaponce for a complaint ??
UC cherged extra for safety etc but there profesional doesn't use them . totally waste of money
We are regular user but last time, I took termite control services. 3 times, person come but not a satisfactory services. Even UC is not able to send person in the warranty terms and condition. Pathetic condition now.
Booked a plumber service regarding drain blockage. Two days after he repaired, the drain blocked again.
Wanted to book but after seeing review. I fixed not to install ths app.. Improve your service. Let's see
Totally time waste company
Poor service. No customer care number to reach out for complaints.
üòç
Mirrors used by Haircut professionals are never clear.
excellent painting work and very professional service done
When ever I book for home service for waxing or threading they send some non professional workers who doesn't know how to wax and their hygieness at zero level Workers. Just bcoz I call them to Old city santosh nagar side and in New city only they send Profesional workers to get name and fame. But,the price is same.
Very bad experience.merely changing names doesn't simplyfying business in this competitive e portal .surely customer experience is the only ladder for all these startup just VCcant help them to rise.
Yesterday I booked service for 2 washrooms . Alongwith that there was option for getting annual membership of UC for Rs 99 instead of actual price of 299 ..so I took it .It was also mentioned that there won't be any charges for cancellation of any booking. Very shortly I had to cancel the bookings but they charged me Rs 299 for annual membership instead of Rs 99.This in my view is quite unfair practice for a company like UC I am request them again to refund Rs 200 wrongly charged
greatüëç
UC service man are very professional, they follow covid precautions seriously, So far we are satisfied with whatever service they have provided us, also we find their costs genuine!
it was good, but I want it to be even better.
charges are too costly
Good
These days professionals are finding tricks to earn more money. I had booked for fridge cleaning services. The professional used a steel scrub to clean the exterior. It bought scratches on my fridge top. And when I asked the professional he lied on my face. Pathetic customer service as well. No use complaining. Salon professionals are worst. They use expired products as well sometimes. Please please do not download this app if you're a new user.
Convenient services. Like it so much that i keep on using it everytime i want something . Update: so far very much satisfied with the services peovided.. love it‚ù§Ô∏è
our first experience is good. pleasing approach and behaviour of service staff noticed.
While you ask for rating professional there is a mislead when you give each out of 5 star,1-1-1-1-1star for 5 asked questions for their poor service it counts all the 1's and then final goes him as 5 starred...very cunning...
very slow
Awesome cleaning
mamta was excellent
great work
Excellent service. Fully Satisfied.
no customer service support for calling. Even if they call no proper response from them. They will say all cock & bull stories
amazing
I am very very unhappy...abt the genuinity durng the process of refund..I have cancelled my booking in August 6 2021..(.Air Conditioner...)..I am yet to get refund...almost more than 1 month..how can we get connect to them??? Rs.780/_ has to be refunded...Urban Company.. team kindly look into it...and kindly return my money ....no customer support service??? I really wonder ......these are the things where people can lose their trust....
Do not go for House painting with app. The experience was no different than having to deal with local painters. The work done in a haphazard manner. Cleaning on floor left, color peeling, had to deep clean my wash room after the paint. The painter did not come for whole one day. The color was to be done as earlier but they colored it different. On top of that after i shared my feedback it was shared with them and they called me back. Where is security, surely need to sue them for for this.
Electricity work is quite expensive and unprofessional team.. two work uncompleted and charged for same .
good work
punctual and maintained all safety measure during job
UC did an excellent painting job. I will hire them again without any hesitation. you should do the same.
If we book a hair cut,it is showing that no professional there to serve you Then what's the sense in making us to use the app? Fix the problem soon guys!!
good service. fixed all defects
They are charging 2-3 times the price for the same product. The advice given is not professional at all and is aimed at making you spend more. If something can be repaired, they will change it and then charge 2 times or more for new part. The customer service is even worse with arrogant personnel mocking the customer and openly acknowledging heightened prices.
Very poor experience with Urban Company. They are total fraud. They will purposely not respond if you book revisit.
the service was very gud the person did great work .
They are essentially subcontracting work to so called professionals .....they don't check if the person visiting you is even qualified. It's a hit and trial with Urban Company....sometimes good professional people sometimes just money scammer's who just keep finding faults with ok equipment.
Not as expected
I am a regular user of urban company services but still these people don't value their users, I booked an appointment at 4pm ( as per their time slots) for my mother and they accepted it but dint assign any beautician and made me wait for it. Then I get a call by 3:50 that they want to reschedule it for 6pm or tomorrow so in short they have no concern about our comfort and convenience. Such a bad experience, I am never going to book any services from you guys.
very nice experience.. will go for it again
They r all chor log bhikari har baat pe panelty sale road pe bhet jao bikh mange ek ek chiz ki panelty lagte rhe te haram khor sale 1star ke bhi like nhi tum log
A very helpful aap, for all your needs
Annual membership amount deducted without my consent. Worst experience.
Good
Great job
so far so good
nice work done
very good Service
The service associates are very unprofessional. They don't follow the slots on time and keep on rescheduling the serive. I'm so annoyed by this behaviour. One of my friends faces same issues with this service provider. I had complained many times and customer service centre and manegerial levels don't take any responsibility or action. Such an annoying!!
Don't trust their painting services. They did grouting and gone away in 1 month
good
After updating this app is not working at all infact its not opening only worst app how can I continue to take any services when it's not opening
Bad
Buggy app which does not update.
I liked the service.
Horrible with spa. They take money for booking and booking never happens . It is fourth time in 3 months they have said, can't send professional, as she has pending jobs. Then they refund money after 5 to 7 days. My money remains parked with them, I schedule my day according to the booking and these guys don't know if professional is available. Spa management and Ac repair management in bad.
Only a overhead small storage to move and it charges me 850 rs huge amount.....very disappointed
No customer care support option available .since 9 days I'm asking for refund and there is no response! Always asking to check with the bank. The bank clearly informed the money is transferred to UC. THESE PEOPLE ARE WASTING MY TIME,MONEY AND PATIENCE!
Thanks for resolving my issue. Wish you have customer care number for faster resolutions.
extremely poor customer service .. pathetic policies leading to customer dissatisfaction
Assigning different professional other than the preferred one without any notice, is not good practice.
Company partner ko bahut paresan kar rhi hai kamishan bahut jyada ho gya hai upar se penalty lga dete jo ki partner ki galti bhi nhi hota hai help line pe call karo to bolenge rifand ka polishi nhi hai jitna paise kmao utna enko kamishan de do fir ye company me kam kar skte hai nhi to help line wale bolte thik hai aap kam mat karo
Good and worth
Ur plumber Rahul Verma took Rs 1500 from me for purchasing sanitary spares and he never came back...urban company assigns fraud technicians for services....it's a big shame on ur part
Bad experience
Worst OTP service
service is good but its little high on cost..
The most reliable set of professionals for all household and grooming needs. haven't had a bad experience yet and UC has become my go to
Very handy
Hopeless service....i had opted for a service by 9.30 in the morning till 12 no one turn up( money is already charged for the service). And call centre people are just buying time..
service is satisfactoryPersonal behaviour good
Good service Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è
Good service
Very nice approach to satisfy the customer
salon service shd be taking more precautions due to pandamic.
Fraud company very less lead chiter for chor he majdur ka paisa khata he
costly than individual work
I would like to clear that I'm very satisfied with almost all professionals who came for service . But This rating of 2 is exclusively for URBAN CO policy of claiming BACKGROUND VWEIFICATION + SAFETY CAHRGES from Customers for each services amounting to Rs 49/- Post Covid since last year onward. Why Customer will pay for Background verification charges for their professionals and for Safety KIT when we are already paying service charges . This need to be changed
I had terrible experience....I had my confirmed booking with the beautician on 9th Sep, and to my surprise neither the beautician turned up neither picked up the call....neither the service center staff was helpful, instead of finding a solution, they said sorry and would call back with a solution....and I get a call after 2 days unknowing that they have rescheduled my appointment (without my concent)....I had requested to receive service on 9th Sep not 11th Sep. URBAN COMPANY NOT DONE!!!
Useful all
Really disappointed by the service. Booked for kitchen cleaning with utensils removal and keeping plus microwave cleaning. Only one person has been sent. In the advertisement it's shown that the professional gets lots of liquids and work is done by professionals?? What kind of service is this since I could have called people locally and got the same thing done?? Really disappointed.
exellent work and full satisfied
They keep deleting my bad review again & again. Horrible service. I had booked for several cleanings. The dude had problem with everything, such as for my dining table cleaning booking, he said cleaning the table is not included, he actually said that, & he had similar issue with other cleanings too. After I gave him a bad review on the app. He returned the next day, came into my home & forced me to give him a 5 star review orelse he wouldn't leave. & he told that the company him to do so.
good
This is pathetic and very unprofessional! This is the 3rd time the service is cancelled, first time the guy, Noor called in 45 mins and told he can't make it bcoz he was sick. I planned my day waiting for him to arrive. Was forced to reschedule, and now when I had it on 9th, again it is rescheduled just 12 hours prior for another date without asking me date and time. I changed date to 11th and now same guy Noor assigned called saying his bike broke!! Such a bad experience for first time!
Your app is not working for so many days..What is the point to have this app.
Update:- same repetition of issue today. Worst kind! untrustworthy App for salon&massage services. The agents aren't properly trained nor the customer executives are polite, let alone resolution of queries. The bookings& assignment of professional is as per their whims and fancies. I have had incidents of wax burn, incomplete services, demands of extra money. Untimely assignment of professional with low ratings with no quick rescheduling was insisted. CS will lecture you too. Money minting app.
service is good but beautician is too late
I booked for bathroom cleaning service 3 days before the scheduled day . On the scheduled day after 2 hours of the scheduled time i got a call from the customer support team that there is no availability of professionals and they asked if the service can be rescheduled to the following day . The next day they called again and said that the professionals are not available still and asked to cancel the service . Very bad experience the first time ,not even eorth one star.
poor service.. without work charge the Rupees
Very bad to read the comments..everybody being suffering..if any dissatisfaction face d,then all the customers being appeal to write down on consumer forum of India on the basis of RTI..EMAIL will be got on Google search
Awesomeüëç
Awesome service provider

Every time showing as professional is not available
Awesome
Feels like cheated, there is no customer care details, I paid in advance, than the package was changed without my knowledge or consent and than almost my 1/3rd payment was deducted.
They CHEAT you. The service engineer charged us 3500 plus claiming that he replaced few spare parts, but the same problem occurred again and another engineer found that the previous guy had just replaced a 50 rupee fuse. When I asked UC to investigate this matter, they were defending the engineers action. Horrible!
Great Experience.
Highly recommended for Ac service
Sir job hai kya, 8 year experience in water purification. Nagpur
Waste of time and money not worth it
Services provided by the company has gone worst and and leaving the services unattended
good
I booked a service and prepaid for it. The professional was not assigned and hence no service was provided to me. No one is picking up the customer care number as well. Do not accept booking for a service if you cannot assign a professional. Refund my money
Nice
I recommend the services of Urban Company. They make it a point to give their best.
Terrible service. Cancelled on me after the actual booking time. I had to drive back home for 2 hours just to be with the cleaners. Total operational failure. Such a waste of time.
Very bad service They late for two hours, the resone that there is no driver to take the girls Not recomeded to use
Poor service of home paint...nobody comes on time, finally i cancel my service request...
Horrible customer care service I booked a salon package and seeing so many positive reviews thought it must be good so bought their uc plus I had a booking on Sunday but the beautician cancelled at the last minute and since then 4-5 times it's been rescheduled but haven't goten the service yet there is no way to contact the customer care on the app 's just impossible I have already paid online that's why I m still hoping I get the service but won't book them in the future worst service ever
the worst company in the market related to pricing. for the same issue the uc tech asked for 4 times higher than the original tv brand service guy. shame on u looters. done with this company for life and suggest every contact in my facebook, twitter to avoid this company by telling about the incident. bloody fooling people's hard earned money by THE RATE CHART...... HUH
Worst experience. Un professional beautician, I took Dr. Renaud facial but it's not good. Not good product and not the method of facial. My face full of pimples after facial and my skin destroyed . Waste of money and time.
very good service
Perfect service
Horrible experience!! You can never trust their schedules, they cancel everything last minute and blame on their beauticians, carpenters, plumbers. This is not the first time but every single time it happens. They don't value customer's time and schedules at all. You book one slot they will call you at the very hour and then ask to reschedule! Please don't go for their services if you want to avoid the last minute cancel frustration. If only there was a negative rating, I would have chosen that.
Good service
Most Not user friendly application ever
Why the eff cant i pay online since like 3 weeks?. I need to go out and take cash just for this app?. Ridiculous. Would look for another app now
very useful
Good
great service
Horrible experience They only give false promises
Pathetic service. I had a body massage booking and no relief at all. An aunty in neighbourhood of mine does a brtter back massage than them that too in just 200 rs. I was robbed of a bloody 1600 rs for a pathetic service. My backpaon has not even moved an inch and i took tome out f my office schedule with so much of difficulty for thisüôÑ
very nice
Everything is wrong with this app. 1 Offers and coupons provided but on the day of the service, they do not assign any tradesman. This causes both loss of offer and waste of time. 2. We get that the customer support teams are provided with a script, but they simply lack any empathy or human touch, for that matter. 3. Every service cost is quadrupled compared with the market rates. Further, there is a silly safety charge over and above the hefty charges. 4. Same or next day bookings not available
Excellent service, courteous and well mannered staff.
Excellent
excellent service
Very bad experience in painting
Till time I have availed few services like installation and salon and I am very satisfied...
FRAUD APP THE CUT MY MONEY FROM PAYTM WALET WHEN I HAVE SELECTED PAY BY CASH
Worst painting experience
The app is good but again the people who vist are same , will try to fool u in all ways , I recently called the service guy to replace timmer for doubble door refrigerator, as only freezer was working and below fridge was not cooling that happnes cause defrost function stops working, service guy came and tried to fool us didn't even realise that timmer is faulty when I again ang again insisted then only he replaced the timmer, and issue got fixed and he was insisting in refilling gas & parts
Worked negligently, was in hurry to go other work by *Mr Sanjay Marathe. I have booked urban c to clean up home. But was very pathetic experience from employee mr sanjay marathe again he had called me to give 5 stars. The doors, tiles walls was dirty just being pretented that how he is expert in his work like a Master. As after his no body work like him. After ceiling fan cleaning he kept the dust on tiles. So great Urban clap. If anyone has doubt can visit my home also I have all photos click
My first experience with the booking. customer service is very worst. I was spending my last leftout money for an RO sevice. It was cancelled by the customer service person and refund I got was 1000 rupees less. I really disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è I never come back to this stupid company for anything after this. I raised a complaint for getting the remaining amount.
Excellent...
must take d services..
Good app for multi purpose and work is done quickly. No need to unnecessarily wait for solution and we get a solution within a reasonable time.
very good
awesome
So much poor services
Good and Prompt
very professional services.
want help with tiles work.. please add service of tiles also
Very good service.
Wonderful
saviour in times when u don't have any1 number in ur phonebook and wife is calling u again n again .... Filter nai chal raha hain, AC band ho gaya n bla bla bla.....üòúüòúüòúüòú
good service
App is crashing but super happy with services Using for last 4-5 years now
Nice experience
Good professionals are onboarded. I sometimes don't find the exact service I am looking for.
The service has deteriorated, frequent last minute cancellations and false promises for compensation from customer service team.
Your assigned person came and took 3500 for Ac repair and asked me to cancel the booking in the app. On second day, while writing this review, AC is not working again. He has handed over his personal contact card but he his not responding on call. Whom to contact???? Who is responsible??
It used to better. The last experience was worst. I opted for classical experience which was cheaper one, but the product was so bad that I had to cutshort the service.
keep it up
Nice good
No professionalism They will provide us with all the slots amd after the booking is confirmed. Before two - three hours. They will cancel and postponed it. Even without asking. The beauticians provided by the company are not professional. They will try to sell us expensive products . Just like any normal parlour facilities. And also try to personally approach and make contact to the customer.
Good experience n service
Worst service after getting massage my back started aching more than usual and had to contact doctor
Biggest concern is privacy. Ratings and comments are visible to the contractors, and the contractors have access to all the client's contact details, and can harass them for giving low ratings. Conversely there is no way to raise a concern without rating the contractor and commenting. There is no option to keep the comment and rating private as well. So you can imagine, all UrbanCompany ratings (including on Google Play) are fixed/false.
Lootera hai service man. Huge prices they will charge you. Lost so much money for small problem..
I had booked an appointment for 6 pm and it was automatically rescheduled to 7 am next day, when I requested a reason they says it is systems mistake, very poor management.
If one cannot watch workers working, they will do shoddy job and leave. Exceptions are everywhere, there are a few great honest workers also. UC hardly has any control on the partners or workers. perfect recipe how a company will be shut down in coming future. Management must not act deaf & dumb, act now else it's going to be too late. Many Thanks.
Do not do booking through this app. This company is full of quacks. I recently had a second degree face burn by face waxing which was done by their sent person. Despite complaining none of their executive tried to resolve the issue. They send untrained people to deal with you. They burn your skin. And even on complaining so many times they do not budge. They take their customers money and safety for granted. I strictly advice to stop using this app for your own safety and health.
The worst experience for my fridge repair. I will highly recommend not to use UC.
weI am writing this review for any new customer wanting to try thier service. Initial few engagements were good but then thier decietful and unprofessional tactics were employed. We had taken a specific vaccinated weekly cleaner but just prior to appointment they call saying she is sick and they will provide a unvaccinated replacement. Multiple complaints fell on deaf ears, reflection of a failing customer service and apathy. I hope this review helps with you decision either way you choose
plz provide a customer care number so that customers can call you immediately if there is an emergency !
I had booked for Washing Machine repair on 05.09.2021, an executive was assigned and he came down and said the mother board of the machine is gone and it has be replaced, as said it ll cost 4800/- also said "bill nahi milega" he took the mother board and came back to replace it on 09.9.2021, I had said him to hand over the old mother boards, he has not given the 1 which he took from home, it's a fraud done. Ridiculous!! Called him and said I ll complain he disconnected the call Plz look into it
The after effects of their last service is pathetic!I have avail their beutician service on 5th September 2021and getting a no. of patches in my arms,underarms after waxing which astonished me to the extreme. The scars and spots are getting deep.A company with a full of unprofessional, unskilled persons including their customer support team. Never ever dare to avail their salon and Beautician service.Already consulted a dermatologist but he is also hopeless.What will I do with these scars now?
very nice
Excellent
price's are a bit higher then the market
They have the guts to cancel my appointment and never call me back.) I messaged the assigned person through chat option at 9:40.... about my location but still no courtesy to come on time..... they charge the customers for rescheduling and canceling the appointments.... but who's gonna pay now??.... pathetic experience ever.... FYI.... I have their prime membership.@urbancompany_UC. Even after sending message on Facebook.... no solution provided at all.... pathetic customer service....
Not at all good with the service . They are not at time . I am waiting from 4 days for my fridge to get repaired but got no service .
very nice
You can't report images of poor job done by professional, you can't call them directly and raise your concern. They will not bare cost of their inappropriate work.
Experienced staffs, perfect
This is very pathetic service, i booked beautician for 6.30 pm by 7 pm there is no beautician assigned and while trying to cancel my appointment its showing 100rs cancellation charges. Whereas in policies its showing no cancellation charges if beautician is not assigned. This is totally fraud service. There is no update or any message of status. I was using for the first time and had this worst experience. If beautician is not available in that slot dont even show that slot while booking servic
What promised is not given, so don't opt for any service.
Very nice
My son called a fridge repair man to check his fridge as it was not cooling. Your guy came over n quoted 4500 to repair it. Anyways he paid 200/- charge to him. In the evening my son called a local fridge repair man n he said nothing to worry I will change the filter and it will work. He charged him only 250/- for it n the fridge is working fine. What frauds have you kept for work? Plz kindly check. If u keep these type of men who will overcharge customers u will be loosing your reputation.
excellent service
services are good enough but they charge more than what they serve
A UC professional - Sambhu Rajbhansi has run away after collecting 4.5k for bringing a water tank. He brought in a old product kept it outside our house and ran away. He had promised a international brand product and got a local branded product which is of very low quality and old. We have tried reaching to CC but we have no help since last 7 days. This is the worst service the company can provide Would also urge all UC customers to tread with
I took 2 services, cleaning and RO installing. Cleaning guys came and locked themselseves in the bathrooms and said finished cleaning and they did nothing jot even the surfaces are cleaned by them nor a house cleaning. So horrible and pathetic service. I took RO installing devices and the guy mukesh came and destroyed ro and said contact RO company and ran away. They never responded to calls nor refunded money. They call and say we escalated the issue and they are worst service providers. Don't
App is very Complicated . Do understand what to do for booking. Contact customer care also not users friendly.
Good app
very professional service...
Awesome service very helpful too
Your app is not working.. Wanted to reschedule my haircut appointment for today as your professional is unable to come on appointed time.. Since app is not working. How do I do it?
Budgets and other things used in bathroom should be cleaned
good work
Mr.Anibrata Naskar of UC did two Bathroom cleaning in my house . I want to give him full ratings i. e. 5* for his excellent job .
Glitch in the app..worst experience
Amazing service
good
They're not providing at home salon services even though, they were claiming
nice
Because this company cuts 15-25% of the workers' income which is so capitalist. Urban Company can be helpful but they can't cut their workers' income üôÑüò°üò°üò§
excellent services
Horrible service and no support to customer. Professional robbed items from home and no action taken by UC
Pathetic.
They have cancelled my booking twice,and deduct money,
the best experience
high charges
They repair one thing but spoil another thing which is not part of the warranty. Experienced it twice with two different repairs.
Excellent service.
Auto assigned the same person 3 times that didn't show up 3 times. Customer service said they will make sure it's fixed after no one showed up the 2nd time but no dice. Very disappointing especially since I've booked before without issue. No idea why this one booking keeps getting stuck with no shows. Very frustrating
V.v.worst.there is no guarantee of the products taken by the company.more than 1 month over my microwave's digital panel had been taken n that technician is only ran away.we r getting only enquiry calls from UC team.
nice company.
Why are you deleting the review?. I wish to mention that the service person who came for my AC service on 30th August 2021 is very unprofessional. He gave me a very high quote of Rs. 4000+ and I declined for the service. He then told me to cancel the service on Urban company because it is very expensive and I will do the same for Rs. 2500. I agreed for the same and now after 1 week the AC is not functioning. Your service agentsuse your platform to build there contacts and not for you. Such irony
Good
We are regular user of urban company services. But this time services that we opt recently from UC are not upto the mark. We got to follow up with Painting people no. of times. Deep cleaning service was also not so proper. Kitchen upper shelves are still full of dust and greasiness. Pest control person also came up 1 hr late. Request UC to make the services more better as it was earlier. Thanks
Don't go to this servise we r bookng to paint my house they don't respond any of my request and there is no costomer service number when they called u then u can say all the problems...and they send less meterial and we request for the meterial allmost two days continuous request ....they r not responsible for the workers....and we r request to not send to the same painter....they don't listen ....they send same painter...we face a lot of problems ....please don't book any service
Urban company has completely lost it. They are assigning male professional for hair spa service which involves neck and back massage for a female customer. Despite rescheduling I'm getting same professional assigned. I have raised this issue. We should have a preference to select professional at least for personalised services which involves physical contact.
Miss guided app which does not tells about Sofa cum bed optn than last moment they charge us with extra 499 for doing sofa cum bed where we have already paid 600 for the service
I am shocked that urban clap does not have customer care number... I placed an order by mistake but there is no provision to cancel... I think this is how they force customers to use their service and if you put review they will say write to us as if we are jobless. And they are so busy .. a company without any contact number what does that mean
wonderful
I am happy with the service provided by the company. Any issue faced is very well and instantly resolved
No customer care services, I have booked a bulk hair cut services. Now I'm not able to use them. Now not able to contact to explain my issue.
good multi purpose service
After making payment by cash it's asking me to pay online
Punctual, professional and cheerful person
One of the worst attitude people. Had cald to cut daughters hair, which says 6yrs old above in the app, but the person claimed that the kid shuld be 12 yrs above. He made mistake and instead of rectifying it he blames my kid , when she had hardly moved her head as i had kept holding her head. If a person cannot cut a kids hair the company shuld not let them accept the project. We are not forcing anybdy to come. Remove the service if its not executeable
Got my kitchen cleaning. The detergents they use are really good, and the man was thorough in cleaning.
The app shows amazing promises of their RO water purifier. DO NOT BUY THEIR USELESS RO WATER PURIFIER.. THE WATER WAS NOT PURE AND MY FAMILY FELL SICK AFTER DRINKING IT. Even after raising the complaint and Urban company taking their unit back, I haven't gotten any refund... It's over a month now. The gig workers are good but the customer care is basically toothless and just shuffling papers. Case number #4058351. Pathetic.
Rates are high compared to others apps like yes Madam....
Pathetic services with high price!! I got my full body waxed and followed all the precautions suggested by the beautician about not using soap or bodywash for 48 hrs during bathing but still got severe allergies on back n chest and now it's my marriage and I so regret booking their services. Also got cleanup done the way she removed blackheads has given me scars that are still there after a month. I think we book salon services to look beautiful but you guys spoiled everything for me.
They have trained professionals for women. Affordable rates. Highly recommeded.
Good services and well trained professionals. Can be little cheaper in rates. Also should allow us to mix and match the services from prime and classic salon services
1 week se Ac repair nahi karaya jaa raha company se itne ghatiya technician rakh rakhe jo logo ke sath fraud karte hai mere ac ke saare genuine parts nikal liye aur usme duplicate parts laga ke mujhe de diya aur technician 1 week se pagal bana raha hai aaj karunga thik kal karunga thik. Company walo ko phone karo woh bhi daily ye hee kehte hai sir aaj aapka ac 100% thik hoo jayega.
very good service
They are charging more than what mentioned in the rate card. Please don't go with these guys. Costs are also too high. We can get done the same work much cheaper with local workers.
great service
Glad to get prompt service from UC.
Excellent massage polite and humble person very talented guy I will recommend many more
Worst after sales service one can expect. I called the technician for some problem in my washing machine. Instead of solving the problem, he created another problem. Now I'm trying to contact customer care. They keep telling me that someone will call me back with solution, but nobody actually calls.
More options should included in app.Also edit package should have access to write what actually we are expecting.
O mm
Perfect service
Whenever I face some trouble at home, I just take out this app, and it gets ever thing sorted, keep up the good work guys, some improvements can be done in design of the app, specially for screens which comes after I place a request, overall decent app.
Easy and convenient service. Very helpful for a city-hectic life. Above all, the service people are very polite, professional and experienced. They also maintain utmost cleanliness and sanitized all the equipment before using. Thank you Urban Clap.
Very poor service
Was very professional and expert beautician
nice
nice very nice
nice service provided ..well on time and friendly customer service...thank you
Worst service center they dont call back and they did not arrange person as per the booking slot
Good work
Excellent job done
Refunds aren't made...
Good one

Urban Company is serving with the best of the professionals, safety and timeline. They make life easy and comfortable. Much thanks
Worst experience they are not on time
There no place were I can reach customer care. No phone ,no email and not even a chat box.
I would require massage services in Lucknow too... I live in near Agra expressway I understand it little bit remote area however u will have many customers who would want to avail the services for spa and massage there
Very very bad service
They are not addressing the issues
v.nice

Salon experiences have been the best
Such a pathetic experience with urban company. I booked service with Shilpi for 4:30 pm and before 1hr I confirmed the bioking as well as shared the location with the professional. She called at 4:07 and just by not responding to her calls and infact I called her just after 6mins i.e at 4:13, she didnt respond and still my booking time was 4:30 but within that 6mins she cancelled my booking. I mean how pathetic and mean people you are.
Rahul is very polite and expert in his job. Excellent experience.
too much expensive
Nice
Very nice and efficient job
Two times I have tried to avail service with purchasing priority membership and twice person has not turned up or not even bothered to update customer ..also customer sevice team failed to solve the problem but confirms membership is non refundable but no service given
good job

Not Happy with today AC service...My AC not at all cooling
Service was excellent
Good job
the company is highly recommended...the technicians are well qualified.
Hassle free n reliable.
Booked a painting job through UC, and they delivered it well. Happy with the overall experience.
better booking facilities
excellent
Pleasant experience!
The most horrible app
Urban company Will close soon in Bangalore
Service charges should be lowered
Experience is excellent. The carpenter called was very polite and did his job perfect . Five star for the carpenter but 4 stars for app. Coz till yesterday it was taking booking but personnel was not assigned but today I got the personnel after 2 hrs of booking. I was so happy after carpenter work. I immediately called for bathroom cleaning and to my surprise I got booking and personnel was at home just in 2 hrs. Before time.
excellent work and in time always
fantastic services
The ICS COMPANY of cleaning is worst they did not arrived on time
Excellent app. Excellent service.

excellent work done by shahnaz and thanks to urban clab.
I was supposed to use this urban company service for the first time in mumbai , but they are so unprofessional that , the person assigned for my service called me and said he is not well, I told to information his company not me. And then I received a message saying ,that the service has been cancelled by the "costumer", what the heck? If u guys can't do your job kindly don't fake it. Disappointed
Gd
Polite, honest, punctual, courteous
super service
Will nover chose Urban clap if coustomer care not available over phone. We All need instant if service provider has no interest in tele communictio and only interested in letter than for sure no one will use your un till it's urgency. o don't want to watste time in messages, I don't like this app anymore
too heavy charges and extra charges
Not getting through customer support service, since morning getting calls, but at there end no one speaks , I had booked my water purifier installation yesterday at 4 pm, waited till 4:45 pm and later received call to reschedule the appointment, so I did for today, don't know what's on received about 4-5 calls but no one speaks.
rates are little higher
Terrible service... they charged me for an undelivered service. The beauty salon never showed on time scheduled and not even in an hour time. I cancelled the service and yet they charged me. I'm still following on my refund
they clean the ac very professionally now my ac cool as new one.... thanks for urban company
Excellant
nice service
you show us something else and do something else
Kent RO filters replaced by Urban Clap are not genuine products for my recent booking and it seems there is no accountability of UC as they don't respond to complaints. I would never get any further bookings in UC with this experience.

wonderful experience, services are excellent, behavior and conduct of beauticians are excellent.
very nice experience
I love this app.fully satisfied with every service which I took from uc. It's good to know that urban company only assigned jobs to well professional.
Worst app No plumber available
high charges compare to market rate
Worst experience urban company doesn't listen to complaint of services dont ever go for long term work
Best services by UC
Very bad
Super
Urban company keeps on increasing its prices and every time I book a service I have to pay extra from the last transaction. This company is just looting people for the same services. Worst app
Most worst experience. My Washing machine is under repair and I had booked for repairs duly paying mim.charges on 31-08-21. With repeated calls , Technician who got nominated this work Mr.Mohd.Saleem, is always gives false appointments. He came on 01-09-21 by making lot of Calls @ 15:00 hrs. Diagnised as defective door. Submitted Quotation for replacement of component . Acceptance given to go a head ,he took the defective part and left the place assuring that he will bring new part for replaceme
Thrice the Booking was done for the men's facial in a single day. And each time the professional brought different product for the service and had to be cancelled. Worst experience ever. Not at all recommended.
super good
Excellent service
very expensive
Very bad
So pathetic service üôÑ üòë Service partner Jaganath from Urban clean company not completed service whereas customers support is not working to sloved tickets
excellent app for home services. The professionals are experts in their fields.
Hopeless technician, after servicing Ac Started giving Problems
PATHETIC SERVICES.. Does not provide timely services and will stick to their terms and conditions when it comes to money.
Very bad service, professional not assigned after Booking and money deducted from my account. Again book the professional, but same no one is assigned. Customer support service is worst as tried contacting but just got the message of they will call in 60 min
should have CC number
excellent
Regret rating in 5* earlier. AC servicing done on may 9th.The service technician refilled gas as well,so ‚Çπ2500+ bill here..We were okay with it as we thought it does need gas after not being serviced during lockdown This gas fill comes with 90day warranty. Within this time thrice it so occurred that thr were shortcircuit&MCB trips The same technician came,made a regular check& kept telling it should not happen again. Now it's 4mnths &I'mpaying ‚Çπ2500 again becoz during warranty no one told gaslk
Don't download this app Fraud company
very helpful service
They're good for basic services like plumber electrician, carpentar, etc. But if you're looking forward to Have Painting services then please stay away. They will take 35% for confirmation & then rest 100% of the amount is to be paid only then further work will be carried out. Once done they will shift dates on their own, their assigned professional won't respond either, they will give you different reasons for delay everytime. So do not take any such big services from them!
Nice
Classic cleaning of the house done... Done a good job ..
worth the money you spend
Good service
best fast services..
Horrible service. Assigning non professionals
booking was done on 5th sep5pm...mechanic came on 6th seop3pm.20hours after booking..it's not right
Very nice service
Felt good and relaxed. Good service üëç
Good
Chor company. Fraud. Just after your money.
Services provided by urban clap is really good. They hire professional people with good knowledge and in this pandemic time taking all precautionary measures. This was my first experience and now looking forward for more.
great service
Mr Kathirvelan did a fantastic job in a very hygienic and satisfying way, cleaned each and every nook and corners. He did complete job without any fuss and smiling face. Overall its a fantastic job.
Initially good,but now few technician collecting money offline and fooling customers with wrong information.shameless company
Good Job
Review
Booked hair coloring services & they provided poor service and on complaint simply not reverting on emails or haven't schedule any call yet to rescheduling this as per their promise on call.And there's no customer service contact no where you can directly contact for your issues .There should be 24√ó7 customer service contact no which is missing ,a very basic thing for any app.
Very bad experience.. I have booked two times for service.i had to cancel my appointment because uc told me no professional is available . First uc give uh appointment and u wait for them to come then at a time they cancel ur appointment.. So I m very disappointed with their service
Worth using Urban Company Services
wonderful services by Urban Company. I tried salon at home and believe me, there are having very well behaved and expert people. thanks
1. Poor service. 2. Support team is really good in making excuses. 3. When any transaction fails that time they don't refund it in bank account instead they just make transacion processed status in app. 4. After using their waxing service I got pimples on my body when I raised complaint about it, they called me after almost 1 week and after 1 week they were arranging dermatologist. 5. Massage therapy is also very average.
Thanks a lot UC for taking my washing machine's PCB and returning it after 8 days, unrepaired! üëèüëèüëèüëè
Good service
Worst company ever. They charged us before and work hasn't started yet. They fooling us around since last 2weeks. Pathetic service
charging high rates for the jobs which i choosen
nice

Great experience ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Urban Club Women therapist Geetika Very Professional Therapist.
excellent service n cheap
FARUDS. They'll sell you extended warranty plans saying repaired is covered. Butlater they tell you only service is covered. AVOID THIS FRAUD COMPANY.
op
excellent
Good service app.
Punctual,efficient and pleasant service. Satisfied.
Kitchen deep cleaning service requested. Person came with a fixed attitude of not really wanting to work. Passed comments several times that kitchen is very dirty. This is unprofessional behaviour. Not acceptable. Person who came to provide service deserves negative rating. And if company has more such people same would go for company too. After speaking to company through his phone,(call back 60 minutes!), Service left half way.
very very polite and professional all the more very clean job
Good job satisfied with my AC service,Techinetion is also well behaved and have good knowledge.
Two days back booked service for washing machine. Still nobody came . Last service done on 12th June so part replaced that are under warranty. Service person called and enquired about the issue. When he came to know that parts are under warranty so he didn't turned up. Very disappointed.
Professionals are fraud...and urban company never replies or resolves complaints either
Fake rating system
excellant service by mr chandrasekhar
Good
Booked service 1 day prior to requirement. Professional just gave her number and i called. She said she has some meetings and can not come on time scheduled I said i will reschedule with someone else. But i was not assigned any professional for my service and this caused issues in my schedule. Totally disapointed. All ads are waste if you can not deliver to something. Customer servicing of urban company is just giving me missed calls, how am i supposed to call back on that number.
good
Good job done by your person....
My recent experience with UC has been extremely bad. I booked and no professional was assigned and I rescheduled and again even in that slot the professional wasn't assigned. This is so disappointing. I don't think I would want to book from UC anymore cause my time and money. Both are being wasted.
Worst service provide by technician they make fool to customer
There is no link to connect for any service related complaints!!
good job
Good services
they are make drama very poor experience wasting time only
There is no platform for customer service. I have By mistake made payment twice for the same service due to network error and now I am not able to reach anyone. I have written 4-5 mails to helpdesk and got a reply that someone will call back and nobody did. The team doesn't understand the grievance and sensitivity of customer's requirements it seems. In this pandemic situation not attending to reimburse my extra payment turns my overall good experience of service done to below average.
Booked AC servicing once few months back with urban company and it was worst servicing ever done to my AC. That person did not even know anything. I myself would have serviced it better. He Just did little this and that and left the house within 5 min's. Pathetic.. Next week after that i called official carrier AC company people for service. And they did very good servicing at very reasonable cost. I really wonder who gives them 4.6 rating üòÖ.. don't know but it cud b artificially boosted rating
My problem is now solved by the urban company team.
Keep up the good job!!
I had a manicure and pedicure booked. The foot filer had dead skin on it from other customers and the nail brush was used infinite times it seemed. When I asked how do you sterilize the tools, she told by spraying hand sanitizer on it. Who sterilizes with hand sanitizer only? I had to cancel my booking then and there looking at the tools. I was really excited to get my services done but it left me extremely disappointed. Urbancompany really has to come up with a solution regarding hygiene.
Very relaxing!
very nice,has Deep knowledge,n excellent work done,solved problem
Become greedy charging extra
Initiated using services of Urban Company, so far services are satisfactory. Hope it will continue to be good.
satisfied with service
Today i had a nightmarish experience with Urban Company beautician, she applied color on my forehead while applying on hair. Still not able to take out color from forehead. She promised to come to rectify error, but did not turn up,No response as yet from Urban Company.....after taking my complaint.
very professional
good
ok ok üëå
Very pathetic and disappointing services specially the customer service and they do not have their panel centralized. They make a lot of trouble while initiating refund. They do not share any booking number or any Ticket ID number so that you can trace the exact status.
Worest App.. Time waist service.. Goys Don't use this kind of app. Thu,,,, Ne...bh.... Che.... Lanja..... Ko.... Ka....

Yogita has done her job fabulous. Her service is really good and professional.
Quite costly for average services
Request you customer care number for each City
So far i have had a good services from UC. however, of late the salon at home services are prized higher than before it was moderate prizes.
Excellent and educated work
Good and timely service
Bogus company.
Highly unprofessional behavior... Without resolving my issue they simply cancelled my service without consulting and deduct cancellation charges and for refund I have to wait for a week. I have wasted whole day waiting for their reply. ...
good service
excellent service
Nice app
This is fine.
can Depend on this App. Good Service
For cleaning service .. they took 500 rs in advance ..promised they will send professional but didn't assign me professional...bad service..I wish I have negative rating to give
No option to connect to Customer care in the App. Just FAQs to confuse the customers.
great experience üëç
Worst App, professionals come without tools, not able to connect... RIP
This is amazing.... My experience is great!!So professional... So relaxing... Thanks a lot...
Poor customer service...first time I booked it and it turned out to be a nightmare...they don't have any beautician to assign.just wasting customers time..
Spare parts are double the rate compare market but technician is on time always and good service
first time I choose roll on wax.experince was very good.
Bahot hi ghatiya company hai They don't have any professional my humble request please delete this ap they just waste your time or money also
I booked UC painting services for one room and doors windows and grills for that room. Had very high hopes. But had a very bad experience. There's no transparency in their process. There is no proper breakup to show what I'm paying for in which head. Also, the box full of materials they send, you're not supposed to know what's in there. Their quality of work was pathetic. Didn't remove previous paint and finish is not upto d mark for the repaint parts. Will not recommend their painting service.
brings so much value and help to the society. keep it up. keep the pride of India high...
No customer live chat or email Id is available.
Exlient
good service
You people are charging double amount than the market rate for type of service you provide! Poor quality products and unsatisfactory service with such unreasonable price. It was a waste of time and waste of money. Charging only for the brand and marketing!
very bad
very good experience with Urban Company
It is good but when they release new upate next time they should add 1Rk option for home cleaning section
Good with safety and cooperation
Pathetic service !! Take bookings by keeping price ambiguous and take full money first and keep on reschudling booking till customer looses his patience. Worst service experienced. Don't recommend them for IKEA furniture installation. IKEA should remove them from their authorised installers list. Worst service !!
call me
Loged it. Excellent service for all stuff
Service not good and technican not reach at time and not lift calls all so overall service and urban company service bad so bad
very professional and expert's in cleaning services
Very Nice apo
Pathetic service, scheduled a car cleaning on a Sunday and it was rescheduled thrice, you really can't count on them, moreover if they assign you a technician/worker for any task and that person arrives at your place and considering his unprofessional behaviour you cancel the task, there is no way you can rate that person...UC can never get a good rating from me, I am using them as I think they have a market monopoly, will certainly switch as soon as there is any other similar service provider.
Till now no service man arrived in my place. I can not contact with the service man with all my efforts
Happy with the service üëçüèº
excellent service
The service is very very good and the beautician is very polite
good service
Good satisfactory service
The technocian for Ac install/uninstall is such a rubbish person. Start increasing the fees as soon as he stepped in. Not ready to lock the gas bcaz willing to earn extra money with such practices. If this is like that then why you fixed the rate for certain job. Really bad company and assigned people..just looters
Good urban vgood
Awful painting experience. Surveyor says he can do se work 20 percentage less without UC. And my main door painting done 20 percentage amd left since I said that was not colur that had choosen
value for money
Excellent App, CARRY ON
The issue which i raised on 05/09/2021 is still pending they only provide a system generated message that they are looking into the customer grievances but actually they do nothing.....!!!!! Yesterday i have raised the issue and then I got the callback their executive gave me a feedback that they could not arrange for the professional so in this way they did nothing.When we use to book the service and cancel it we got penalised but on this happening we as a customer can't do anything....
Great facility for every work
Reviews of all services in the app are curated. Had hired for 2bhk painting, waterproofing and grouting. Started work on 24th August and finished on 4th September. Bath Grouting is already peeling apart. Lack of tools and training are the root causes. The supervisor is stretched thin and results in lot of rework. There are no quality checks after by someone that is not part of the working team. We have to run around for touch up and fixes.
booked for fridge repair. Firstly, that guy arrived a day late.So evening 5:30pm appointment change to next day 10:30am. He did not arrive till 12:40pm, Finally arrived, checked it for just 3 min. & said we have to pay ‚Çπ2568. We agreed, waited for him to buy parts and he arrived at 4:45 pm. Did repair, fridge stopped working in 2 hours again. Called him, came next day at 12 noon. Asked for ‚Çπ1000 again. Fridge didn't start again. Said he will come only next day. ‚Çπ3568, no repair. No professional.
nice service, video call facility is very good, and also it is free of cost.
Horrible customer care service. Do not use the app. A local plumber or carpenter does much better job for reasonable price. They just ransack money in advance, don't do any work properly, do not even have a contact us option. We just need to be under their service, till they call you back, according to their own convenience, abd still not get the issue resolved. If these are the things you are looking for, why not Urban Company. For they know how to get on your nerves
Great experience
Cheater company hai partner our customers dono ko bebkoof banati hai.
Bahut bura service se pehle hi pesa mangta h Mimbarsip ke naam pr
Great app to solve all problems.
Worst possible customer care experience. Raised a complaint through email that there ac guy duped me of money and got a reply that it will be resolved. After that got a reply that my issue is resolved which it clearly did not. I have written 5 mails after that regarding the same issue and I get the same reply everytime that my issue is resolved. They have made it impossible to talk to someone regarding a service once it is completed. This customer experience when I have been a pro member.
I have booked cleaning service of my house,uc have scheduled this service 2 times but did not send professional for cleaning an today they again called me that they are unable to send professional very bad service requesting you to close the service as you are wasting my time . Why r you telling lies you wasted my time and .faltu service please close service of fooling people.there was no option of giving rating in minus then it would have been given by me -999999 stars
I'm not sure what's up with the cleaning personnel that you send. But each time someone comes they either break something or damage things, are they not trained? In spite of saying repeatedly, please let me know if you need some help or can't understand something. Items damaged: mop broken, lamp damaged, plant leaves damaged while moving, damaged a bathroom glass while moving roughly.. The whole glass infact fell. I'm not sure what the lady was thinking. Was fine the day before. Disgruntled!
Very bad sistam
Excellent
Wipiu was excellent she did massage as per it required by me.

Terrible service and unprofessional
A life save app
Nice service, but have less employees to attend the service...
it's amazing....and well hygiene ..... professional are good ..
superbly message
Company doesn't have customer care number if customer want to call them we can't after dialling the recorded voice is telling us to enter 4 digit number but from where we have to enter 4 digit number when I asked professional she told me even same thing is happening with her. Why contacting you is so difficult. Horrible company. I want to change my contact number for that also options are not available.
good server
Most pathetic professionals who don't know how to speak, not at all courteous and are always rude
professionals of urban company are very good. I am satisfied with services
nice carpenter very good urban company
Worst people hired, very unprofessional.
I don't like the review of urban company because on 1st September I call urban companies man to cut my hair and he don't cut it properly üò°üò°üò°
excellent
This was my first experience with Urban Company and it was a good one.
good
I don't laiket
Service is very good. However App is not convenient for multiple services booking at same time
excellent service professional and polite.
Don't book urban company please . Only money west . I'm a urban company professional . Poor service please don't book üôèüôèüôèüôè
good app
The job specification is well defined but the customer has to be aware. Some technicians do not follow the specifications fully though majority of technicians follow the specifications.
good
The experience is poor, very unprofessional service, no hygiene
Ms. Rakhi did her job well. perfect gave face message. very calm and friendly üòä
good Service
Second time failed.to assign professional. Custom representative promise to assign professional then they never call back.
Always hindi ads.. no respect for local language but want business from non hindi belt
I can't choose my therapist
many times payment transaction is getting cancelled
reduce the price
Very useful üëçüèø
Worst services , not professional towards his services, as they are people know ,they having much customer base..cheating on the name of membership..
Urban company is expanding and increasing the scope of work. more training to professional is required to enhance the customer experience.
very professional, and good work by urban team.
Good Service
amazing experience
nice
I had booked my Geyser service, but they messaged that we called 3 times to reach you but unable to contact. Actually I attempted the calls , but there side no response at all. Finally my booking closed without intimation
very nice
Incredibly poor customer service, professional charged me 2500 to repair the thermocol in my refrigerator, no spare parts replaced. No explanation from urban team either
Urban Company professionals are not professionals anymore. They do not arrive one time, they do not do their job well. If you try to contact help center then you cannot because there is no option to call them neither there is any option to chat. So you are helpless with your booking.
gud...
Good Service
over all good service
Guys please never take pain relief massage therapy from UC..They send unprofessional and untrained people. I am having chronic back pain issue,after explaining my problem also they had sent an untrained lady and it's been 3 days i am unable to even walk properly..My pain has increased to next level. Tried reaching UC many times over complain option on APP but no response till now. They have one number which always says we have huge number of calls on waiting and no response.Shame on you UC.
Excellent app
super rrrrr
Service was ontime
nice
Very poor service. Assigned person doesn't turn up as per slot and Urban Company reschedules as per their whims and fancies. Customer support is also below par inspite of a case manager being assigned.
Good service
I have paid for Rs. 299 for uc membership & also paid Rs.273 for hair cutting today as per the schedule provided by UC. But they will not depute the professionals for service as per the given schedule & also customer support not responding quickly as per our requirement. They have wasted my time. So i am requsting UC, kindly cancel my uc membership & refund my money accordingly . Worst service experienced with UC. I will not use uc service in future.
Experience with one of the plumbers is pathetic. He mended a flush, charged me for jaguar and put a duplicate part. Unfortunately, the flush went bad a day after the warranty period. The guys at call centre do not acknowledge this. Pathetic is the experience .
always give a good service
Very satisfied with Hetal Sutariya. Was perfect and as expected
I had good experience with their beauty and house painting services and and both service dealers were accomadative good... thank you team
Without class Don't go by the advertisement. 1. You can't call customer support directly 2. Package are made intentionally complex and after booking you get half service and they charge you more for full whereas initially only you opted for full service. Still confused, check rating for the past 1 month
The urbanclap employee came for haircut and free detan. He suggested/insisted me to upgrade free detan service to a face cleanup worth 800 by paying difference. But later I found that there is no such facecleanup service worth Rs 800 present in UC app, but it is for 599 only. I saw he used oxylife tan remover. So dont know which service he gave. Also he asked to rate him excellent infront of him. He didn't have any wallet payment option either.
Service was scheduled at 11am and till 12pm the professional was not assigned And against my wish the telecaller assigned one and made us wait for 2 hours, because of which I had to cancel my other appointments. Highly disappointed.
Ther is no Helpline number or customer care to provide assistance related booking queries and very high cost in the name of COVID
nice
Everytime, booking on every service, safety fees is being charged apart from membership fees
Excellent service.
Waste app chuthya banaraha hai
as always there should be some offers to opt service frequently......
Ac service exceptional üëç
Part rate card and technician rate are different
good
good behevior
Excellent App with Excellent services especially during the pandemic times
ok
I love the service and the behavior of k.laxmi is very descent
Even though as service providers, they do not have any platform for complaints or customer support. I hired their pest control services twice, in Mumbai as well as in Kolkata, and both were ineffective. Within 2-3 months cockroaches started appearing. I couldn't find any customer complaints no in the app to complain. PCI is anyday far more effective and efficient.
Worst service. Shut down the damn company
Worst haircut ever. Didn't like the service
Urban company professionals are very well trained
The app has gone from. Been fantastic to drastic
when the customer doesn't understand the exact issue..he usually expects a visit of the specialists person... here, the technician asks everything over phone from me...and later provides his suggestion that it is not possible. terrible
Excellent Service. Fully Satisfied.üëçüëç
simply excellent
They do not adhere to what they speak in customer care.
person behaviour good.
OK nice service
Good service
Accuracy
I booked a professional but no one came on time....waited for 1 hr ...no response from the uc team ..no helpline to contact....first experience bad experience....waste of time
excellent app with prompt service
Super Services by Urban company
Price is unnecessary High..They come and ask for extra money. It should be more transparency in terms of pricing+servicing.
The whole kitchen & all rooms were having pest control liquid. This is not all modern way of pest control. Cleaning of your mess is your responsibility. Now I have higher another people to clean up your mess. Every where liquid. Not a professional & high standard job.
Excellent Service
excellent work
Professional services at your doorstep.
You people must understand the value of time of other perosn...worst experience...
My refund has still not debited in my account so dnt give advance payment
Home cleaning Service at Vizag has been totally unprofessional. The home cleaning work has been offloaded to a third party and the workers have been given one rin soap and some other chemical which even the urban company are unable to answer. Needless to say the workers are ill equipped and Untrained. But the workers themselves worked hard to their best. The company needs to review it's hiring of third party firms whose standards are just not acceptable
I faced many Issues after the booking. No one was assigned and after receiving many calls from company the issue was not solved. Very un professional behaviour from company customer care officers who called to help me.
Cheaters. Frauds. Worst service. They claim that they have 100s of professionals in the city and these are not professional at all. They keep asking you to reschedule and the professionals keep denying your service. Worst service on the planet. You guys better join a management course to learn how to serve and manage customers.
Very bad service, dont get booking in time ,they always reschedule due to unavailability of staff. Pathetic.
Very unreliable.....
The company does not care about customer's time,not committed to a fixed appointment that has been paid for and above that does not even care to send a message or call that the commitment can not be honored. However the money deduction process is butter smooth. Probably they don't have competition in the market and probably have tasted some success and it seems that it has gone to their head.
Good Service
Not good for classic catogery very low rate packages in provide luxury service's very uncomfortable sply classic catogery iam not happy be a U,C classic catogery professional üòî
Thieves are managing this company and no intensions of paying refund after cancellation of service.
Fraud company h.....
Tried booking for salon services from months.But they show no slot available everytime.
Customer service is bad, portfolio is good though. I booked for revisit for the bathroom cleaning service i took and the assigned person denied and I am unable to reach customer support.
Very bad experience with this app gays don't use this app no response and the gays are playing games really very warst urban company
safety kit fee is collected but not passed on to technicians.. very bad
Truly Professional
Too much costly.
My hold off amount is not refunded. No response from the team.
Very poor and unsatisfactory service by urban company. After kent RO servicing, the professional didn't came back for the problem we faced after a couple of days. Even the customer care executives calls and promises to call back but never did.
service is good
Great Company with Best Value Services
Okok
Very Experienced Staff, polite, disciplined and they use very high quality products
satisfactory
Good and professional company
superb service
Nice service
very professional , very courteous and very safe.. highly recommend
Guys if u are thinking to take the services from them, then never ever take their services. They are frauds and liers. They just do fake promoses and lie to u all the time to hide their mistakes. I am giving them negative markings. I would ask my friends n family too to stop using their services. Completely unknowledgeable service staffs and no customer support at all. Totally disappointed.üò°üò°üò°üò°
Excellent Service
I made complain but no one called me even after 24 hrs
I had a great experience the first time but this time the services which I booked created a big confusion so the system needs to upgraded
excellent service
Not satisfied previously not giving any rate
.. D
The service was satisfactory
Every service in one click. Good to see such amazing on door service by Urban Company.
Waste services.. After booking slot also we were unable to contact.. No contact number.. We have to wait till they call us.. For me they were rescheduled three times and cancled finnaly by them.. If you have high demand please don't show timeslots unnecessary wasting our time and making fool
Excellent service

Excellent Service..

Easy to use. Transparent pricing and trained technicians.
sometimes rates are higher than others service provider
Good experience
Illiterate type of professionals u people are hiring, they do not have any knowledge about the issues. One day they say this is a permanent solution and another day they say that they forgot to tell that issue cannot be resolved permanently. I m going to uninstall this cheap app
very nice
Excellent üëçüëç .
Painters did not come at appointed time ... Help desk only escalates matter after 2-3 calls. Pay Advance and then forget. Concerned team does not give call back. Frustrated with response in last two days ... no particular contact person assigned to solve your queries or issues. wanted painting to be done for Ganesh Chathurthi .. but next available date is 7th .. how can they finish job in two days ...
Very poor service not provide the service on time, engineer denied to come as per the suitable time slot
Excellent Service
Waste Of Money , Very Poor Service
very good...... excellent service.......totally satisfied....
good service
Kitchen services are totally hopeless. They come home look & say- it takes time, therefore will not do and just leave as is. Book only if you're ready to spoil ur day
The stylist provided her service very well. She behaved very fine and did her job too comfortably. Excellent.
I always use UC with a scheduled cleaning every week. However, in last couple months my cleaner was changed without any intimation. I was still ok with it, however now is the limit. My new scheduled cleaner was on leave yest (booking scheduled every fridays), so when UC called i specifically wanted same cleaner for sat at same time. Since she was not available at that time, they booked her for noon and app updated accordingly. Today while checking, cleaner was again changed without informing me.
Tiday I done , deep clenaing for my 3 Bhk flat. Work done to the satisfactory level. All their staff were very cooperative. Kishor ,Vikas,Tejas and Sahil all these worked dedicatedly. I will definitely recommand the work from this team. Thanks alot.
Superb
Booked for water purifier repair. He behave rude and what he done also not statisfied in 2 two days system is not working. For TV repair he done extra Wholes on waals by without taking proper mesurment.
Urban Company has the best services to provide for everyone. Indeed this app has all what we need for cleaning or relaxing üôÇ
Horrible Serivice
I have found UC to be professional and they mean business
Worst experience..booked a service for AC repair and then due to the service provider denying to come had to cancel..but now urban company is not refunding the amount
Till now, Urban company and its services have never disappointed me. Employees here are highly professional and trained well.
Really useless and a waste of money . Inspite of reminding the electrician to get larger drill bolts , he ignored the message and the work could not be completed because of his ignorance , and they still charged me for it . The money would have been utilised in a better way if I had used it to wipe my nose . Where's the zero star option ?
Not able to book sercie neither able to find any contact no. In app...pathetic App
Such a worse app. If the services are not available then why are you showing the slots as open.
Nice app but they have added too many extra fees , so total amount gets bigger than actual price
Professional services and great customer service at extremely reasonable prices
very good service and products.
nice aap
Worst customer support, their pest controls are useless, waste of money. Once raised with them, they told that they'll provide follow up complimentary service, it was just a false promise, they never reached back.
Its not number 1 company ,its chefs and services are poor .Urban team now days ,very busy they taking booking but later no come on time nor responding
Fooling customers. They charge hefty amount even for very small work. Just of no use. Prices too high. Won't recommend to anyone.
perfect and super
Very HELPFUL APP
One of the worst cleaning company, I booked four times their service but they didn't show up they take bookings and last moment they will call and say sorry we couldn't find anyone, they are so unprofessional
Excellent service and professional technician...iam impresses
great service
88. E E
The services provided by urban clap are too good,my only concern is with the beauticians,they never arrive on time..almost all of them come half n hour to 45 mins late..Someday it's ok,but all the time not acceptable...Please let's value the importance of time..
simply great job
No one showed up for service Noone informed us they will not be coming. Wasted our time.
Pathetic. The services have gone for a toss. The beautcian can burn you,she can peel off skin,she is liberated enough not to give post wax/threading treatment, and the customer care executive will say that Urban company has got so many customers,meaning,those complaining are just useless. They can say anything,but aren't willing to listen to you. Better opt for local parlours. Atleast we woukd be saving on some money.
While UC is adding new and better services. The salon packages are clubbed in a way that are no more economical. I had loved the addition of the hair services. Today when I logged in to book, I noticed the division of the grades of "Salons" and the services under them were more expensive than our parlors. The good products/services like the roll-on waxing are only in the premium category which earlier was also there in the other ranges.
Fake promised
Good
Excellent experience with urban company.....they are doing very good work
it's very bad experience. not once.. 3 time.. u cannot call to customer care
Do not use this platform at all! Their prices are more than double you will find locally and their so called partners will just come and spend 5-10 mins and give you a price quote of minimum Rs5000-10000 for anything and everything! They don't even spend time checking your device properly. When you complain about such service to their customer care, they just say we're taking your feedback! If you check the reviews, most of their customers have mentioned the same. Stop cheating customers!!
A very good performance.
Great
Worst service ever. Will definitely not recommend. They broke my AC on the name of fixing and are denying to come for visit. Horrible customer service.
I had a problem with the service but it has been resolved to my satisfaction. Thanks.
Urban Clap should be more careful while onboarding Professional as one of Urban Clap professional came to my House for TV Repair and taken my TV for repair then he called me on my mobile number not thru Urban Clap app and said because you have pressed display problem that is why you need to pay minimum Rs 4000 though as all colors and pic is ok so if you would not have pressed display problem then you would have need to pay Rs 2000. Now till date he is not returning my TV from last 15 days.
Irritating customer care!
It's a scam. I made a payment of 14k to get my ac fixed and made the payment by cash the guy who came to repair entered only 1660 in the app and took all the money for himself and urban company says they can't do anything about it. Horrible experience. I am still waiting for them to contact me regarding this complaint and it has been way too long. Don't book from here. There are so many companies outside that do better job and also take responsibility for their work. I won't even bother to rate
Worst service, with worst professional people
good
They are Cheating people by selling fake spare parts in more than 3 times the cost for appliances repair. As a company Urban company entered in the marked for repairing the appliances and providing salon services but now they have fully modified and forgotten their root value. Now with time they started keeping spare parts for the appliances and they ONLY provide services on their spare parts. I have ordered genuine spare parts from LG but their customer care refused to provide services.
Service is good.
Good Service
evey second professionals bike gets punchured often and that's the reason framed for delay...professionals dont come on time and you end up wasting your weeknd waiting for them..
Excellent service.sanjay kumar pathak is very nice person awesome service
PATHETIC SERVICE. not able to reach professionals any way.. pathetic... really pathetic service.. not easy to communicate to customer care as well.. it's aways difficult to find way to hear human voice for your concerns. I feel it's really unprofessional service. TOO BAD.. your team wasted my important 2 hours waiting and your professional not picking phone, not reachable.. no response.. really bad...
Very useful
Very good service at affordable price.
Pathetic Salon booking service. Booked at 7 am due to busy schedule. Calling the beautician Rina Kumari since 6.30 am but she has no courtesy to pick up call or reply to chat. Then at 8 am they want to reschedule as per beautician availability as if we are free here. Why are yoy giving slots at 7 am when your employee don't want to come.
wrst service
Pathetic service ....I booked few salon at home service on 3rd sep and got confirmation and allotted time slot was 5 pm ....bt they call at 5 .15 and said they are not failed any beautician in my area so can I reschedule my service ...so I did it for next day that is 4th sep. Again they confirmed my booking and alloted time slot was 11 am and assigned a beautician to me ....now that beautician named started messaging me that can I again reschedule my service coz she wud be busy at 11 am...
very nice service...i liked it
Wonderful experience,
Literally ***** ppl.. they fix the iss temperorly and after sometime again the same issue comes and the worst part is the tech don't even bother to answer the phone..
Most useless service for repair and very over priced. Absolutely callous attitude. You keep calling help desk but no action taken. They keep calling and promising prompt action but take no action. They really cause harrasment to the clients. Never go to them for anything. Uninstalling the app.
I liked their services but i dont know why they charged 49 extra for ppe kits,because noone wears ppe kit. They only use gloves. They should waived off 49 rs.
Professional is very good service but Urban company very bad Beawar not good Beawar partner ke sath
The worst cleaning company to deal with 2 times they call me on the exact time of my booking and telling me that my booking is cancelled and gives me ridiculous reasons They wasted my time and even did find any solution to fix there own mistakes
No comments...pathetic service
Dissatisfied .. staff with zero knowledge
very good
Many times after payment they cancelled my services..and the professional not even responding, after cancellation it will take more time to refund
great service
Pathetic service, the so called professionals don't ever show up on time. Their personal hygiene is questionable, especially since the customers are paying a hygiene convenience fee. I recently purchased a membership subscription, and I wish there was a way to cancel it.. but there isn't. Pathetic service .. please hire some professionals that know what the word means, or set proper expectations.
I got charged more.. I should have paid the employee directly
polite staff n excellent service
It was my first booking via urbanclap and turned out to be a nightmare. My experience was unpleasant. If there is no beautician,you should not give a slot. She made me wait for 1 hour and she didn't come. I mean its insane. We took out the time,you just can waste our time. Proudlly uninstalling the app and will share my experience on other public platform and social platforms.
Nice I have given 1 star but I changed it to 4 star for resolving my problem but need to add contact information for customers to connect for any problem
liked the water purifier service and the cleaning services used so far
Worst Company..do not book them for any services..Totally unprofessional and liars.making money only
All services are veryyy good
Better Service.
she is soft spoken n her work is excellent
Absolutely Seamless experience. Had an issue with payment once but the customer experience was instant.
great
Customer complaints are not solved
Barbers (Hair Stylists) don't use basic hygiene despite such Pandemic episode across the globe! They didn't even have sanitizer for Ram's sake ans started misbehaving when I enquired. Calling these bearded terrorist like fellows Home is risky. Won't trust these rating you show on the App for these Barbers and opt for names and faces that sound /look decent.
Amazing Job.Keep it up.
good
Poor customer service and poor spa. Developed body aches
Poor service. They will never arrive in time even if you book a week in advance. Most of the time they will damage your AC/ Fridge while doing servicing. It's always better to call your neighbourhood technicians.
Its getting worse. Very dissapointed. Beautician neither called nor provided service
New version confusing . 03 sept 2021 ‚ñ†‚óè‚ñ°‚ñ†‚Ä¢
This is the most pathetic app I have ever seen. Never ever does the job professionally. Whenever I book any service they have end number of excuses to cancel or to reschedule it. They don't have any proper number to call. No chat options. You can only request for a call back which they will do on their own time. This is the third time they are cancelling my service without giving any compensation. Worst customer service. They just want to disconnect the call.
Excellent service..Thanks
we live out of India.... we come once a year. earlier managing small repair jobs was a hassle. as chasing professionals is not an easy thing and they would endup overcharging. now UC has not only made services easily accessible and punctual but also affordable as well. UC customer support team is excellent and very professional ..... Keep up the good job Urban Company and thanks for bringing this change ........ Keep rocking. going to us UC services in Dubai as well.......
Service was extremely good
Very bad company, i request cleaner to come and when she didn't attend at the time i called her number on the app, she said I'm off today üòÖ I tried to call the help line but they were useless and they don't have solutions
Good service
please start services in Udaipur
ren and grace are very helpful, polite and punctual.
Worst experience! I had a booking today for 9 AM but they dint assign any professional and called me at 9:30 AM and asking me whether it is ok to reschedule the appointment for 11 AM!!! And when I agreed even at 11 AM the professional wasn't assigned and later they told me at 11:30 AM that the professional who was about to be assigned to me met with an accident. Again some other professional got assigned and now he is still playing around with me by just delaying! Kindly respond and help me out
too costly
The free services provided as offers are fake. It shows on the app as first but doesn't get included in the bill and so beauticians refuse to provide the free service.
Bad service
I had book UC services multiple times, but this times experience is very bad, I scheduled for salon at home service the beautician came late n she didn't even bring her PPE kit n then when I asked about it, she showed me tantrums n then cancelled the booking by herself n left... On top of it app has reschedule my booking according to their preferences isn't it great???
excellent job done
Beautician is never on time....changed the beautician but still facing the same problem.
The complaint resolution isn't satisfactory because they don't stick to the resolution provided and without even cross checking with you, they would book something you hadn't asked for
Excellent work and very professional . Very happy with their service . Highly recommended
Not reliable at all Booked it 3 days before and the day the need the service they just rescheduled it without informing me
Very üëç
Please keep the identity of the person giving feedback after service, anonymous. I had a bad experience with a service person calling me back asking for justification for my feedback. Probably a quality assurance person can connect with the customer to understand the feedback better
Excellent concept of providing home service in the daily life essential areas. Quality of service awesome and services providing partners are really good.
Service is very good
The cleaners did not clean the chimney and also the wall adjecent to the kitchen katta. When i asked them y, then he said thats its not in the package when clearly cleaning chimney was definitely part of package.
Remove your services if you cannot complete them. Worst customer care as well. Cancelled four times consecutively bcos of non availability of professional even after booking days in advance.
Urban Membership We are buying the membership for better discount & Offers but even after subscribing for the membership we are getting a discount of only 100rs on the total billing amount than what's the use of buying the membership if we get a fixed discount of 100rs. The discount rate should be more for the members. Please consider this point.
very nice
good job
I purchased two hair cut service and the complimentary services written on the package was changed at last minute after the professional visited us. On checking with support its told that the complimentary service package isn't available.
Service is very bad
So far Excellent service for various services.Thank you Urban
Very worst ever experience. Kindly please don't book this service anymore guys. . I booked for bathroom cleaning, the job was left incomplete. The professional promissed me to complete the job in two days and force me to make the payment. That's it, after getting the payment he absconded and no reply from Urban clap as well. They will behave like professional but they're third rated criminals when it comes to money..
Terribly a wrong decision to hire person from UC (your so called experts you claim always) for Chimney Cleaning Service. The person damaged (literally broked) one of the main clamp while dismantling for cleaning where oils actually gets stored. He initially told us tht he will get it repaired & took the stuffs along with him..after repeated callings, he finally came & dumped the same items without any repairing. He had initially tried to make us fool but later had admitted his mistake. Now what?
Verry bad
Hight rates never recommend
They never give full and correct invoice for services
Nice Service.
Pathetic service providers..don't go for UC for any service..
Very bad, i have sent mail regarding my issue and I have received a message shall get back to you but till now no one have contacted. Very poor communication
Nice experience
Your professional told that there was a short circuit and the bord is not working.. He has taken the board for repair and it's been 5 days and no response yet. Only reason t chose UC was for the time and professional service . I'm sorry to tell but I didn't get what I expected. I could have got it repaired for a local person for a cheaper price and fast turn around time.
excellent service..very well trained staff
logging in authentication is not that good only login otp feature is there some time due to bad network the otp is lost and multiple otp are not received. and cannot login due to the multiple otp which is very inconvenience to customers alternative authentication must be there.
Excellent & prompt service highly trained professionals
good
The worst service ever. The ladies were 2 hours late which is not acceptable and the cleaning was very bad and had to stop the service. First and last time to work with you
If project is allotted to Kaleem bhai then no need to worry for anything. You just chill and let him do his work. Based on his experience, he may suggest you to revisit your color choices. Then, my personal experience says that kindly take his advices about shades color combinations, stencils and patterns. I don't have proper words to express my feelings after seeing his finishing touches. My personal experience is too good for kaleem bhai. I followed all his advice & say I did right things
Rates are too high and not enough details for services
The app doesn't show any option to check available time slots. Directly jumps to no slots. No proper way to reach customer service as well.
Really very nice experience Professional, Perfect, Punctual, Polite Person, Good Service.
V.good
Highly unprofessional!
It was frustrating experience with Vimal Dubey,chimney service engineer then to make matters worse it was like Yogesh the customer support was kind of threatening to charge entire service charges as I refused to allow engineer to take chimney along with him. Worst service company with hidden details and not at all customer friendly.
Worst app.. Multiple time rescheduling without asking customer. And no rfund option very pathetic service.
super good service üëå
loved the App and of course the services... Waiting for UC in Prayagraj too ‚ô•Ô∏è
The service of Urban Company is fantastic. We get trained professionals at reasonable charges without any efforts.
should assign the professional atleast 4 hours before the slot. In my case professional assigned 4 hours later the scheduled slot.
It's been a month I have installed this app and trying to book the salon appointment but everytime it says no one is available for the service.... If you guys don't have proper services please mention it properly
Not very good at service, and not even answering to requests when booking is delayed by uc
absolutely great no need to wait hours in parlour to get required service. My baby hair cut is always perfect..and he is very happy.. It would be better if there is an option to upload photos for a clear picture of the work done .. thank you UC
Services r excellent
Very gud work ,very very happy n satisfied
Nice
excellent service...perfect work..nice approach
Excellent service.
Hardworking People but the Videos shown in the application has created too much Hype which is giving expectations to customers which cannot be fulfilled. just dont believe the videos in the application rather than that the service is acceptable good and appreciated in terms of what hardwork the employees of UC do. I'd expect a little low cost in the services because the prices are very high in terms of service.
Be ready to pay more when u opt for service in UC. You will ask for one service but by seeing your locality, residence technician will propose other thing and charge high. Better opt for local technician where no visiting fee, x fee, z fee,etc.,,
worth for money.. very good service
well designed packages with thought to details, well trained and pleasant staff. give full justce to the treatment. very easy to book and order the service. very happy since I found this company.
Experience was bad
Customer service is absolutely pathetic. been waiting for my refund for 10 days now, and it has not even been initiated yet. No response to emails, constant procrastination by the customer support agents
nice service
good experience fixing geyser. polite and cooperative
Booking payment made for salon services. No one turned up. A lady called up and said their is a delay, and will be assigning soon. But almost 3 hours, nothing happened. Sheer waste of time
The services are patheic. Work was to start 2 days ago. No sign of supervisor. Do s not pick calls. Call centre not contable. Very poor service. Stuck after money paid in advance.
Thanks alot for the help
Absolutely horrible proffesinals sent.. earlier as urban Clap the work had more selection process that brought only trained professionals, from past 2 services we see that the work delivered is worst with high cost. Mails were sent yet zero response from urban company regarding projects. We recently called a plumber who kept talking on phone half an hour inspite of coming one hour late, he broke the tap by giving is assistant and luckily I did take a video of it.pls call some known proffesinal
Good Service
It's a great app but the app should clarify about the hidden charges.
convenient and on time
Roshni
good service nd well done Mr. kamal
great jobüëçüëç
Reported right time, good service good job
Worst castomer service I booked AMC for my OR but your partner say your filter is not maching with my OR why you not clarify before payment now I tried to cancel my booking there is no option please clarify this and cancel my booking and refund the amount
Nice app
Worst services ever! I made a booking, they keep rescheduling it and then call me to ask why I rescheduled. Their customer service is trash and they again rescheduled my service without my consent to 7 am in the morning with no further rescheduling possible. It's not even my fault. I booked their service as I had to go for a function. They reschuled to a point where I have already attended the function now. I work in a night shift, I won't be available at the reschuled time. Disgusting!
Very bad experience for painting with urban clap.
I am posting this again cause you guys told me that your team will resolve my issue instead your team says that sir this is out of warranty we can't do anything. My first time with urban company, you destroyed my AC and now you are calling me to tell me you can't do anything and I have to book a new request where you will charge me more and than again destroy what is leftover. This is the support urban company provides. Please don't use it . Worst experience ever. Dont use it anyone ever.
good service
Service was Good
Superb experience..
Just rebrand yourself as Fraud Company. Was overcharged for a plumbing service and after raising a complaint on the app not only am I getting harrasing calls from the plumber but also the customer service. It's been more that a month after the service and still no solution at all. Abhiraj Bhal, Raghav Chandra and Varun Kaitan.. you guys really need to look at how your company is being run.
I have booked for manicure and pedicure both the avl kit were leaking and manicure kit cleaner was having a glass piece in it , the service lady tried to cover up that its a sea salt but i know tht it was glass piece because it pinched my finger tip
Good Service by Syed
Never been disappointed.
excellent work...
Too many sales and spam messages. Other people use contact information to send sms. No way to remove info. Horrible app. Their help center is of no use. No response to emails.
Useless. Pay first and you never know how good or ACTUAL problem will be resolve or NOT. Electrician or Investor kind of issues need to discuss first. BUT THIS APP DON'T WANT TO LEARN/IDENTIFY PROBLEM, THIS APP NEED MONEY FIRST FROM YOU!! Whether their technian will able to solve or not does not clarify. LoL.
Such. A bad service. For bathroom cleaning deep cleaning half of them will never bring machine to clean. They will just landup
I couldnt Make my Booking.. Worst app
Excellent professional job. Mr. Sameer is perfect and skilled in his work.
Charged me much higher after I verified the pricing of the circuit board for my washing machine online. Service personnel was decent well manared. Overall not a good experience regarding the billing part. Hopefully won't continue in the near future
highly recommend great service I am glad for an excellent service
very nice
I will install app first then I will change my rewiew
Great app to book varied services
While services are good they are discriminating against their employees based on vaccination status on the app now and displaying temperature records on the website. Dissapointed in them for invading employees personal space.
Bad experience
Rate is too high just double
UC services are very good but the app should have few more features. If you can add preferred language and map accordingly will help people to enjoy service better. Also, if there's a promotion running it doesn't reflect in the final summary order in salon or spa services which makes it difficult to convey and convince the service provider.
Liars, cheating, advertise misleading prices
Very nice app
Service quality has reduced tremendously. Quality of products used is pathetic.
Disappointed. The AC failed after a week since it's repair. Called the UC technitian again who charged exhirbitantly for replacing capacitor. Won't recommend UC to anyone.
Professional sis not complete the service. I was told I will be contacted to reschedule the service but no body has called me. I have put in a request via help numerous times but absolutely no assistance received. They took the money for the booking as well as membership and did not provide any service. Utterly disappointed.
very good service
Very bad this company
Nice experience
Not reliable service partners
So bad app plz not you's it chetting
okey
Hi mene urban company me ac service book kiya good service i am happy thankq Urban company all members üåπüíùüíùüíùüåπ

Worst service ever. Irresponsible beauticial who is not even bothered to inform that she is not going to come and when reached out to customer service they are unresponsive as well worst experience ever.
gr8 service
Very professional and through work. Understand the customer needs perfectly and taylormade solutions to all domestic tasks.
Not able to open app via WiFi in android as well as apple phones. Tried uninstalling app but didn't work.
I have ac issue but urban clap company is not yet solved my issue i spend rs 5800 waste of time he dont have skilled technical person totally waste of time and money
it's good service by uc technician
The most fraudulent company I have ever seen. Don't be in trap of these cheaters , they will take your money and your problem will still be un resolved. Boycott urban company. I have already spent my 3.5 K in AC and now these people have made my compressor leaked and now asking 50% of the total cost from me. They sent 4 technicians but the problem is still un-resolved. Their technicians have damaged my blower as well. Pathetic people, pathetic service and pathetic customer care.
she is amazing .I really liked her work ..thanku Kiran
Amazing
Exceptional service 2 Good
very very good
Nice app
Very good
I really appreciate their work and polite nature.
Beaware if using this app , charged for subscription i never opted for.... Raised ticket but told wont refund anything.. Felt cheated.
It's pathetic.. khuli loot macha rakkhi he
It is good concept
Thoda acha karo maja nai aya üëç
Refund nhai kiya pesa. Boldiya pesa apke account me aa gaya. Par wo jhut hai. Contact number nhai hai. Application sahi se work nhai karti.
My jobs had been completed by UC okay before, but the painting I requested was pathetic, I paid 30K and it was a total waste of money this time without proper cleaning
This is pathetic. They don't provide any solution to any of your problems. They cancelled my booking twice and then again was asking me to wait. One should never use urban company
good work perfect experience men
Very Very Very poor experience with Urban Company. Money not yet returned for the work was not completed by UC MAN.
Very happy with m all the services I have availed Recommend to many friends and family
Just loved it .thank you UC....its very helpful üëç
Good.satisfied
very neat and good work
excellent work by hitesh panchal
It was very bad experience with Urban company. I have booked both the service for Microwave & Washing machine, minor issues, i paid 190 +190 , Booked the service, after service when service people closed the case again i have to paid for Microwave_89rs & washingmachine_139. So why are you not telling the price from the begining so that customer will not confuse. So i will never booked the service again. Showing one price after service more price have to be paid.
good job. completely satisfied
Best service by Pooja. She is expert in her work. She is punctual.
very good service ..
The service charges are too costly... The covid scenario no options but just for a visit its too costly
Urban company bina information panlty lagati he jabki costomar censal karta he rahul viswa karma uc partners
Very helpful services offered by Urban company. Especially during COVID times
Hidden fees/charges. At the booking time fees is less but after service they take extra charges. Not happy . Bad experience
excellent. in all aspects
Nice
It doesn't support IPHONE properly.
Service is üëçüèª
Extremely over priced. A Big 'No'.
Extremely overpriced. Services are not at all reasonable for the prices paid.
All good :)
Lack of coordination between their Surveyor and Supervisor.
I have been utilising services from Urban Company for two years now. The professionals assigned are courteous and very competent. They provide very high standards of services at reasonable cost. The range of services is very vast and meets requirements of most Indian homes
Nice service
Bug in android app. How to share it with urban company ?
Worst customer service - Taking the money in advance and not delivering the promised service - waste of time and money !!!!
Worst service with familiar name..
This app has become worst from the best... None of the technicians are worth this.. Literally a waste of time. Better go for local ones.
üíØüëåüëçüëçüëç
Waste of time,local guys will come u for bathroom cleaning,guy is good,but not a proper material, they also use cheap Material,it's better that we will clean with our watchman
service is good. But I think he had to be with more patience
Good
Its a great app provides solution to everyday problem in household
urban clap very good service
great
service guy was professional and fixed the issue quickly.
Bad company for parteners...
I have booked a revisit for AC Service on 26th and it was scheduled for 27th sep but nobody has still visited and today is 29th sep. I have mailed the same but no response has been given from your end.This is really unprofessional. I have already paid rs3000 with 90 days validity but noone has shown concern for the revisit.
very good ,i want it again
I like your professional service but your online service is abysmal. There is no way to contact the company incase of a query in case of doubts in service we are to book and "help center " offers little to no help. 3 star is only for their professional safety guidelines but if this post was only about their app then it would 0 or minus
The service is really good.. thank-you
thanku
Absolutely Terrible Service. Don't use netbanking with them. After your service is done they will show more amount as 'pending' and never tell you why. Customer service is useless and you will have to pay additionally. Your local service will be much better than this.
Services fall apart right after the warranty period. If you are booking a service with them then expect your service to last as long as the days of warranty and then pay them over and over again. Something about this doesn't seem right. Customer service is of no help and if a problem arises then you can count on it never being resolved. Throwing your money in the trash is a better option than urban company
I think a bunch of unprofessional diiiiiiccccckkkk headed people have opened this company therefore, their technicians are exactly like them. Never on time. Never recieve calls. Never give clear cut answers. Bunch of m***erf**kerz.
fload, Please Don't install this application, please
It's really strange that your app doesn't have any options for customers to contact customer service desk, nor you have online interacting system. How do a customer get help from your company when required ?
Bad UI, location is messy
The job was carried out effectively
160 was the booking amount, but end of the job there was extra amount added and need refund immediately
Please try giving RTPCR services also
All good
Very good service and very good behavior, very polite person pooja ji, good work.
very professional service üëç
Mr Dinesh from Urban Clap came and repaired the Geysers ( 2 nos ). Very thorough and courteous.
Formly used the App from last 2 years but suddenly not able to book the favourite professional.. trying from last week but not able to book.. only the thing showing was no slots available.. highly disappointed. Urban Company should clear thos point why we cant book the same professional which we know is best for us and who work in past by them.?
I did have a bad experience before, but now they resolved my problem. They have a great customer service and I will use Urban Company next time for sure.
I am not satisfied U C app service charges is more expensive not good for washing machine problem
It seems packers and movers not available in Thirumullaivoyal Chennai, I don't find option/menu in the app
Pathetic support. I have mentioned 3 times that I want different professional but all 3 times same professional was assigned. What is the point of selecting a reason while rescheduling then! Very bad experience.
Concept is good but their charges are exorbitant,I moved house and had to book carpenter twice and an electrician.Carpenter was booked for assembling bed and there was no extra work but the carpenter visited and asked for extra 500 Rs to do the job. Same thing happened when we booked it for assembling cupboard ,the guy asked for extra 700 Rs.We also booked a technician to fix microwave oven and paid 468 Rs. The technician came,did some checks for 5 mins and said we need to pay 1600 more
Service providers are not available at all , what platform is this if service cannot be provided
Update: yet again after many calls and assurance that same mistakes wont happend, it happened again. It was great but recently its really bad and unprofessional, i have fixed booking with specific cleaners and they keep cancelling them last minute and it happened more than 5 to 6 times in the past 3 months with no proper explanation. what makes it worse is that the replacement they provide are not as good not even close. Very disappointed and cancelled my services completely.
good professional people and committed to work. my 1st time in mumbai
superb excellent service.... Application....
Pathetic service.
Thoroughly professional and very well behaved.
it is awesome
No customer care no updated its been 10 days my refund is not processed
super
This rating is for the last service, horrible experience and still no one has called me for the complaint that i made on Saturday
satisfactory
Booking cancellation fee is charged inspite of professional not turning up on time
Service is excellent
good
great job by Krishna Murthy
Our experience is not good ,the ac repair guy came and did the job but after few days it started giving problems again. No one is there to listen ,no place to register your complaints ,need lot of improvements as u r in service industry, what's ur complaint cell no. Whom to contact , every things is mentioned but not the customer grievances cell ...not at all happy
Very poor
For a very first time I was booked slot for salon service, but tracking of beautician are still not available at the end of slot time. When I was called beautician to saying your tracking was not showing to me, then he said " Mai nhi aa paugi and cut the call". Very bad behavior of the beautician. Very bad experience
always helpfull app and service
I booked a cleaning service , I had paid money immediately after that No body called me No body came for service person supposed to come on Sunday No response from the urban Company also
Connection Hose description says includes service up to 2 units. But plumber charged for 2 units seperatly. Customer care also supports the same irrespective of wrong description. Dont exoect Amazon kind of service or support.
Good
Don't fall into the trap of these crooks. 1.They are simply pooling the local service men and parade them with company T-shirts (and most of them don't even wear these) 2. They are more keen in getting the payment done and never bother to do the quality control 3. The so-called local partners cheat the customers in numerous ways which we can't imagine. 4. The staff are very arrogant with business like attitude - not sure what they are proud of 5. There is simply nothing you can trust about them. They have never fulfilled any promise - never on time Its a mafia at work in the disguise as a service company - Beware of it!!
Bad experiance .
Self added in reviews becoz i dont add anything without clients information how can add. And taking extra charges for safety measures for corona but not seen.
They do a good job
Very patient and punctual. Such a cool idea and I love it
Excellent service
professionals do great job but urban company charges extra amount for safety precautions but they don't provide safety kits to professionals as they mentioned in their packages.
Excellent
Superb service quality and staff behaviour.. will recommend to one and all.. tha ks UC!
excellent service.. thanks!
ok
ok
good m satisfied
Professional service, punctual, hygenic. Had a very good experience.
I have been using Urban Company for many years. It is good only for standard services such as cleaning, salon. Provides one stop solution. But for customised services such as painting, repair of appliances, UC doesn't have proper checks and controls. One is left to the mercy of the painter/electrician etc.
Like -"East India Company" Service professionals lose everything.
They openly cheating people ...I have paid 13000 for painting and they denied to fill cracks and didnt removed old color from wall. On top of my old color they applied new paint. Within 4 hours lot of paint cracks are visible on my wall. Even they unable to remove water mark on my wall ... ..I'm going paint again with local painter. During quotation discussion they told me to remove old color and apply putty and two layer color. I have raised around 10 complaints they nenver visit the site
Subpar cleaning services. Be warned!
How should I contact customer care? My payment keeps failing and I need quick help to book a service
high rate of cost
Worst customer service experience ever had in my life. I don't advise anyone to deal with them. I booked for 2 hours cleaning service from 3pm to 5pm and now its 10 past five and they are not here
Bad and Money frod Company Big Big money frod company
good service...
cost is too high for some of the services
good service
Not Worth for waht they charge
pathetic service. even if you have the ticket open they would close the ticket once it has reached 90 days from date of service
Booked pest control service along with cleaning add-on. However the cleaning service personnel called up to tell that he will only take out the utensils and the later rearrangement part is not in his service. Cancelled the services. very bad experience and no information transperancy. That's why avoid opting UC services.
I have been charged for the services that I haven't even received. This is a serious concern when the customer is charged and no services has been provided. I urge the management to look into it and refund the money which is kept at your side.
Very unprofessional, first time I booked since morning twice they have cancelled the booking. If the professional s are not available than don't make the slots available. Simply wasting my time and money
Good service
Why have you stopped cash payment
Good Service
It was awful in painting service they took advance amount 35% sent wrong materials. Painter didn't came on the booked day and time. No prior intimation. Help service didn't help. I lost 5435 plus 99 plus time and energy. God bless others üôè
If I could give 'ZERO' I would've happily given it. Worst Service. Why do u guys accept booking if can't provide with the service. It has happened for more than 3 times that they accept the request and then no call back or no professional is alloted and at the end we have to cancel the appointment. And the sad part is there is no no. to reach them for AGRA..
App good but service provider bad not proper knowledge
Usles
They send professionals
timely and excellent service
Very poor service, The boy come for services without open the filter,he said everything thing is gone like filter and memorian,we have to change and the cost will be 5000.The price of products of the company very high.
Poor service
Jitna bolti hai company utna karti nhi .join ke time bahot mithi baaten baad mai call karne par job se jude manager seniors ko call lagao to receive tak nhi karte .join ke time paise bhare hum coustmer ka ulta sudha sune hum aur uske baad kaam ke liye recharge kare hum sab ke baad bhi gulamon jaisa behave. Sharm aani chahiye logon ke saath cheat karte aur jo supervisor kaam karte hain tum logon ke saath .unke saath galat behave. Sharm karo sharm ‚òÜ1
high charges for some services
Much needed in today's world. Service is excellent.
Great job !
company should send vaccination certificate of the persons coming so that it can be verified that they are vaccinated
awesome
Bad customer experience

Jaimini is the one who did massage for me she was excellent.perfect pressure and took her time. very professional and clean.
I haven't found any customer care number/mail id/ chat option in your app.
Bakwas
had booked for clean shave and hair cut. very profession and punctual
Expected a better quality of service.
good
The Painting service i have booked from you was done badly. Painter had dispite with your measurements and charged Rs 3000 more. He did not complete the Painting of one door and painting was done hurriedly and badly. Entire Rs 26000 paid is useless
How to avail my second cleaning option?? They already charged money for three cleaning services for 6 months...and the second one can't be availed.
good work
pricey but very convenient for all needful services & assigned professionals are mostly professional

Love the app , Great Service, Easy to use
very helpful app, the staff are very professional and the work done by them is very good at a reasonable price.
If you want to do some cleaning work or small repair work then go with UC. But when ever some Electronic or macaninal repair work don't use UC SERVICE. They always use duplicate equipments and charge will be higher side. After some days you need to repaire again. This application has only instant review of services. But the reality is you can give proper review after few days of the work. You can see the problems after few days. I used lots of services from UC, faced problem after few days.
I'm extremely DISAPPOINTED with the service bcoz he used fake product I suspected it that time only coz fragrance of the product was completely diff. I asked him nd he showed an old lor√©al hair spa container. Now that my hair are surprisingly dry nd hard to touch I am very sure it was something else,my hair have never been dry I get spa done only for nourishment but instead my hair got damaged this time. I am REGRETTING my decision of booking my spa with Urban Company. Such a SHAMEFUL act.
Worst service. I made a booking for plumber for installation of wash basin and he refused to fix inlet and outlet pipe at the booking cost
without asking they reschedule the appointment
Excellent RO service by Mr. Logaraj

Good job!!! Keep it up!!!
Yah company Chor Hai professional Logon Ko Pareshan Karti Hai customer ko Pareshan karti hai Sarkar ko isko nigrani rakhni chahie aur company ki jaanch honi chahie company ko sil karne De
4 stars because there is always scope for improvement
Poor customer service and these even professionals are lying.. Such a bad thing for a service based firm like urban company to give such a poor quality service to customers.. and no customer support is functional... Hugely disappointed
UC has made a name for itself by providing quality service in every field it touches
Good service
Best company!
Excellent
Company simply making money. Never thought of good service. The service man are not well behaved, Company not taking any responsibility. Better to do your job by locally available personal.
he is such a nice person...great service
bhoomika was very good her facial massage is good‚ò∫Ô∏è
good work my 2 bhk house painting work done by urban company, good consultant (NIRMAL) given good suggestion as he promised every thing is done in time
Some of their masseuses are very unprofessional. They are late, without informing and the products they used are not New as they are supposed to be. Urban Company needs to check their staff better.
manoj, amit, vikram, kannaya worked very well
UC should inform/ train service provider about the work details.
Would never recommend you to book services from this company. Unreliable, unprofessional staff, pathetic service. Service levels are steadily deteriorating. Twice in the same day, they were unable to provide the promised services on time and then they take ages to refund the money!
Good app but price bit high
nice services
Very very bad experience
Horrible !!! I booked service Since last 2 hours waiting for it. Trying to connect but Neither beautician nor customer care is picking call. Pathetic
No option to turn off promotional notifications. It keeps bombarding spam.
Good
Excellent service
Nice Service
Nice
Very bad experience. Technician came on 24th May, changed Aqua guard filter & took Rs. 8000.00 but he has cheated us
Service is satisfactory
This is my first experience and it was really great. All the things were very easy and systematic. thanks
Never seen such a confusion app, no clarity of service and comparison. UI is over glorified than avtual
No management
Reducing rating now... professional did not come on time
good service
spring cleaners team was do excellent job
Excelent service
It's very good experience
Keep it up guys
excellent service.
I have booked first time and waited waited and waited... my first booking will be my last.... this was my trial as to how professionally service is been given we do not have full 24 hours to wait for your professionals to come.... very worst experience.. i have booked 4 times to call me back no call even came for the same concern.. this very unprofessional...
It has been 3 days since I raised my dispute stating I have paid extra to the professional. Nobody is calling me back to resolve the issue. I have been charged extra at the time of payment. This was my first time with UC and it seemed horrible.
Poor service .. poor time management.. we pay in one day advance for Booking. Still beautician doesn't come.. happened many times.. worst experience that too many times . Customer service never support us.
Beauty parlour services are good n economical... having good experts...
It's great platform and app. Hope to see the cleaning and painting services go live in Manipal, Udupi, Karnataka.
Seamless exprience, great stuff!
service was really good
Awesome
No means to contact the customer care or does not refund any cashbacks as mentioned in their offers, planning on uninstalling the app, as its not user friendly at all
Good service
Pathetic...Indifferent Service
Excellent
nice
75% of bookings paid in advance fail for alternative time. Don't understand why accept the order. Refund takes its own time after that.
good and efficient
Worst app....shows something rate are something else....please ignore such idiotic app
The worst ever services, cancelled the services just 5 minutes before service time and not able to speak to customer care also Worst to the core
Pathetic service‡•§ Hired them for kitchen deep cleaning the person creative scratches on my acrylic kitchen doors ‡•§ my glass hob was spotty all over with the chemical used by them‡•§ my sink was left shabby after using it ‡•§ Would not recommend their services at lot‡•§ Very un professional and untrained staff‡•§ it was a very stressful experience for me‡•§
Excellent, Professional service no matter if it's Home Cleaning Services, Spa or Salon
Excellent work , fully satisfied
Worst experience in my first booking itself... Booked 2 days before but in last minute they cancelled my booking. They don't have sufficient technician to provide service as per commitment.
Good service ! only star remaining was not given because it took much time to locate my address which is within One km from Patna junction
good
Worst company. Charging extra money on name of hygiene and Covid. No partners change mask or gloves when they do their work. After completion they only wear gloves and mask and upload pictures. Total fraud . Uc have been created to cheat people.
The partner is prompt. He extended professional service. He is quiet and gentle.
Excellent service very easy to use and on time
Good
una Seth Good sarvice helpful aap
Pathetic experience, these people are white collar thieves. Such startups have money to start business but dont have atticates to do business.
I booked for RO service and they didn't complete the service. Reached out to Customer care executive and she escalated, still didn't get call back. Simply looting customers.
good great
Very good services during covid
Very good service
üëç üëç Very nice
Horrible experience eeg this app.
Goood !!
Because this appointment was supposed to be at 6 in the evening yesterday but very unprofessionally told that beautiful is not available in spite of making a booming 3 days in advance.
I wanted a professional for myself. 2 of the beautician denied and asked me to reschedule I'm uninstalling this app
very good üëç
excellent
amazing service...please keep this high standards the same and keep making our lives easy!! Thankyou Urbanclap!!
Good
Excellent Service
I called the plumbers from Urban Company. They were very helpful and also guided on me which part to bring from the hardware. My first expierience with Urban Company was worth giving full 5 star ratings.
painting rates are different from what we hear and what we see on the app. So, a major flaw
Too costly. I'll not avail the service once pandemic situation eases out.
excellent work,polite behaviour, for any work go for urban company thank you urban company
polite and professional
Good
The TV repairman absconded with my TV and I had to plead him to return it back. An FIR is already there. UC did not have any idea of my TV in this whole nightmare of 20 days. Go for local service instead of UC.
I availed of Carpentor service. He was punctual and fixed the problem to my satisfaction. Followed all covid protocols
Very very worst , they are not cleaning the bathroom properly, and I informed to customer care, they told to clean the bathroom on next day we willsend the executive, but the executive didn't come, what to do, very worst service money waste
Very helpful
Very Professional and Expert Services
time bound & good service
Arrrived in Time and did the work nicely
Excellent
Professional team
Good work ok bala good cleaning
Good service
Idiotic company. Looters
Amazing services by Chena... She is the best
This is my first experience. I had booked an appointment for 9 a.m. which professional cancelled at 8 a.m. Then my appointment was rescheduled to 11.30 and still nothing from UC its already 11.40
Do not use urban company for AC repairs and sofa cleaning, had worst experiance. AC is now unrepairable. they just top up gas do not repair leaks properly and it only works for a week or less. Charge higher than the average market rates for poorest services.
Ford company
Excellent
I want to change my rating as it seems that UC is not having control over their AC service personals and spare parts. It seems that spare parts are either very cheap or old and repaired parts are billed to us. Spares and service have 3 months warranty and on most of the cases, it lasts only 3 months.
useful app
great service
Awesome experience !
Poor response. Not meeting scheduled timings..
I booked a ac service standard plan in which i was allowed to book twice in 9 months but after availing 1st service now its almost about 5 months and i m not able to book my 2nd service No customer care no also Pathetic service from your side You should atleast give customer care service to us....
good Services..
Very professional, polite and punctual staff be it beauticians, massage therapists, house cleaners, pest control or even carpenters. A wonderful easy to use website with great reminders and online payment/ feedback mechanism - A highly satisfied customer :).
Good Service
Its 3 or 4 times Expensive to the pro guys we found in neighborhoods. i called a carpanter to install glass racks one rack installation cost 139rs i installed 4 racks it took 5 min to him to screw 32 screws with machine i i paid 700rs for 5 min job including 1 screw for my wall clock. it was a job of 250rs localy here. Pros are in hurry to reach next destination and want all thr items ready to install where as many times u want a pro with you to go with you to market to buy a right product.
Fantastic service, professional, cordial and well groomed. Don't think I will ever go to a saloon anymore.
Worst service by urban company Paintimg service when you raise complaint for any thing you will prompoted for only call back request in 60 min and wait can be indefinate without option to call cusotmer care leave on there mercy
Waste better to contact local shop
expensive services
Recently the quality of service is not upto the mark. There is no Customer on call support?
Very good
Today was my first experience with you and it was not upto the mark. I booked stress relief full body massage specially for head and shoulders. Leg massage was good but if I talk about neck head and shoulders it was not good. I didn't get any relief. It was full body massage and She didn't even do hand massage. I reason of giving her 5 star rating is her behaviour. She was so nice and also I don't want to spoil her rating. I really want you to look into my feedback and do something better for me
I got cheated from urban company. Firstly, U cannot cancel the booking and that option is given to the technitian directly. For RO servicing UC cannot provide for aquaguard. I lost 2k for cancelling the booking. UC didn't refund. We cannot contact customer care, nobody receive the call. Don't trust UC.
requirement to do X number of request in a day is pushing URBAN service provider to rush the job. instead of taking time and do every detail check.. they are in a hurry to rush to the next job..they won't even take new additional work once its determined that there is work. most service vendor would like to stick to what was added as a service this is getting worse .. month by month.. electrician plumber carpenters every one that i have used in past 1 year keeps giving me the same answer..
Never works in ludhiana
Unfair booking and poor feedback
nice service and professional üëç
No response from Urban company. Massage therapist assigned dint turn up and doesn't respond to call. Very slow customer care service. Would like to give zero rating for customer care service and unprofessional attitude by the therapist
Very poor
pathetic that there is no live chat support or Phone support.. slots available 10 minutes back do full all of a sudden and appear magically after sometime... not 1 but all the slots
All services with very professional workers
excellent work done by Mr Praveen Kumar
very good house cleaning done
I am hundred percent happy with their service's buddy comes on time, does cleaning, gives quotation with warranty....really good üëç
Great app
excellent
I am extremely happy with the cleaning services. personnel are very professional and do a thorough job without cutting corners. I have repeatedly used the services and found the service levels consistent. two thumbs up
very relaxing
great ease of use
Bad service. Shoddy work. I had booked for home cleaning. There were three guys who came at 9.30 when the timing I gave was at 9 in the morning. After 3 hours one left. The work carried by the other two were so shoddy They had come to clean windows without proper tools and Colin.. I paid the remaining amount by cash. But there is no confirmation from Urban clap and now the app doesn't show my booking. We need to think twice before booking urban clap
The assigned cleaner didn't show up and didn't take calls. We requested for kitchen cleaning. We Kept all kitchen items outside and waited. NO one showed up for cleaning.
Good app
Great
2nd AC service scheduling option not easy to find. I had booked 2 AC services in April and paid upfront for both. 1 service was done then. Now, when I want to schedule the 2nd one, the app does not allow. In addition, toll free number or complaint section isn't easy to find.
u don't take responsibility of Ur own co which is sad customer books the service if good luck good person will come and if bad luck bad would come was unlucky once tried to seek help from u but all in vain
excellent service
Good

Very nice app
Bad service ... after finishing my manicure and pedicure move to polish past I asked for many colour the don't have the I told her it's fine I will choose Whit French she told me I have to pay more I said OK then she start to using beige base instead of the white cos she don't have... It was unpleasant experience even I called the customer service in UC Will not use it next time
I am highly impressed with the quality of service and would definitely recommend it to you guys , good service
Unprofessional Employees they don't even resolve your query. Mine is pending over a week. Cheap App #Urbancompany I am again adding to my review don't go with them they have not resolved my issue for last 1 week they lying never gave call back and don't tell the timelines. They have damaged my Microwave now #Urban company don't working to resolve it. Any1 reading this I have all the proofs they just ignore the customers very bad service.
Amazing Service
nice
I have been using urban company services for over 4 years. From the first time I have booked a service with it, I never had the need to visit any beauty parlor. It saved money and more importantly, time. Very professionally managed and a very friendly app.
good
excellent service delivery. very good technicians
Very nice experience
Your Company is still not really Urban enough.. while it has salon and spa services for women.. there's no Spa service for men.. we are restricted to only get our haircuts and massages..
Vivi has amazing attention to detail, very polite and patient. will definitely book again.
One of the worst service done by urban company. Avoid. Think 100 times before taking service. Pathetic experience.
nice n helpful
nice and excellent work and good employee in urban clap
Verybad 2times my booking didnt come even they deduct the amount of the service
great service to the urbans
Good
I just repair a fridge which is really silly repair ( cooling problem due to ICE frozen in cooling pipe) but the professional comes and do such repair that now water is licking from the top...so I again book a service to authorize samsung dealer...bogus service given by urban company
Service by urban company is always upto the mark.
Service of professionals deteriorating. I booked for Cooler cleaning. Neither he used any cleaning material nor equipment. Just used plain water to wash tub and cleaning completed. Very much disappointed. Not recommending any more
Bad company
very good
excellent job... thanks a lot
good
Nice behaviour
Excellent services, keep it up.
Good service
Prompt and better service at the appointed time. Really appreciate the service personnel for his straight forward service.
Earlier I was fond of Urban Clap Services But now it is unprofessional Today (28/08/2021) again I booked for cleaning services and there was a issue with the professional...
Worst. Ruined my washing machine and when I claimed warranty for that no one came to solve the problem. They said we will send a professional in 24hrs every next day I contacted them and it has been more than 2 weeks.
a bit costly but worth of it in view of full satisfaction of the customer
good
excellent
Technician was not familiar with Daikin AC. AC started showing error after service due to moisture in PCB but resolved when dried out by hair dryer.
good service
I'm not even satisfied with your company. We can give you enough money . What are you all thinking. We too people only. Why in our area the agents are not available?? I think so this app is only meant for high class people . We need the service to be pure and trusted.
lovely service
Great service
excellent work by Sureshbhai...
I applied for paint service paid them 10k and 99 for expert both are west of time and money both are highly unprofessional don't have value of time thay dont know anything about there work and both made fake promise.
Excellent
I'm giving a single star cause there is no negative rating this is my first time experience with the urban company I have booked a complete house cleaning service two days prior the schedule and they haven't even assigned the professional till now which is past their given time and no proper customer service no proper escalation of complaints. And what I wonder is this is what the service we get in the Asia's most reputed home services company. I have lost my commitments and cnt get compensation
Thoroughly unprofessional
Booked sofa cleaning service for 10 am , the proffesional has not turned up , his mobile is switched off. Raised 5 call backs with urban clap , not a single call back received , mailed them again no help, customer service is pathetic. Whole morning wasted in chasing urban clap
Super
Very good
Professionals never come on time or they cancel after keeping customer waiting. Very disappointed on 3 occasions.
too expensive
great as always
awesome for reasonable prices
I had an awesom experience....she was very polite and made me feel very comfortable
Very unreliable. Last minute cancellations. Highly unprofessional. They have no backup in case an assigned person is sick or due to various reasons cannot be available to meet the order expectations. Would have given 0 star rating if that would be possible.
Salon work is very good.. AC serivce is very bad..
After booking for a slot no one contacted at that time even I called there was no response.compsny person was also non responsive.really worst service
Pathetic professional and pathetic customer care. Due their pathetic professional I am facing neurological problem and they are not even replying. Forcing me wo escalate the issue in consumer forum.
reaching out to you guys is very difficult and not everyone can write email to you... my grandmother uses your service manytime but if she faces any difficulty she is unable to call you neither she can write email. Also No office numbers are given .What should a customer do?
Unprofessional services.
I was very disapointed when i see that there is no computers and laptop repair services...i wants to join and work with urban company ....i wants to give my services for the peoples who r facing problems in their laptops and computer hardware ..i dont know why u have not added these services..in ur app ...i am waiting when u will add these services .
Salon is pathetic. They keep cancelling and app don't have enough option to reschedule your appointment
GOOD nice techies
Mind less service opreter not work focus and backchood opreter never again i m using this app
Useful
Trying to avail carpentery service for last 10 days, thus far UC team is failing to find and assign a carpenter.
Jis company k cm har month change hota ho wo company chor company h
Achcha Raha experience
professional services
Always punctual and reliable services offered
My air conditioner is working like a tap after the second service I took from urban clap n no one is even listening to my complaint n situation is so worse that I can't find any information about how to contact them there's no customer support
Nice
Quality of hired persons (not professional) are fraud and they can even damage your appliance
I have never seen such a worst company like this. No option to call customer care.No email I'd provided And cancel button is disabled. God knows how Custmer will get refund.
It is good service and initiative of company
Very bad experience for kitchen cleaning microwave and fridge cleaning
nice, v professional, impressive service. Tried 1st time , to the satisfaction
Good work
Don't use its RO parts, I have used it's RO motor. 3 month warrantee they given and motor stop just after 4 month.
Professional denied to do the service and there is no way to contact the customer care. After the unprofessional behaviour if we try to reschedule it, then we need to pay RS 100 extra.
she is very good and followed all safety measures.
excellent
Excellent job
I never expected that portal like Urban company can be indulge in fraud. I ordered a plumber today for some repair, have already paid 218 inr via Gpay and your app doesn't show that I ordered something. I have no Booking, so how can you guys charge me 218 inr..?
fix some place not clear
Pls check offers properly...I have lost my 765 rs because of wrong offer published in the app... technicians are good but app is really confusing
I have been a loyal customer of Urban Company since the time they were known as Urban Clap. But, off late their customer service has become pathetic, for the lack of a better word. There is no option to call the customer care or even chat with them directly. Please understand, humans need to talk to other humans, not bot-ish FAQs. Emailing your helpline, not getting a response there too.
it's a convenient app. it can be great if they were a lil cheaper.
mrs venkata kumari is very professional and her service is very relaxing
I had horrible experience with UC. Waste of time and calls and energy trying to reach out to the professional .........who never bothered to call. Hopeless service.
Unable to login.. Not getting the OTP
Not RECOMMENDED I booked 2 cleaners at 4 pm, the company called me to cancel 25 minutes before my appointment!!! I already have visitors and depend on them to send me cleaners. They are totally Unprofessional, and shouldn't be trusted.
RO guy Nahid Pasha. Cane for a full RO service charged 2700/-.. after 5 months , water was not flowing and I had to call him again, pay 1500. To fix it. He insists to give UC review as 5 star at the end. I made that. mistake . Please don't give review for at least 2 months. See how the appliance is working and then give the rating. I would have got a new RO, for spending this much.
vaishali did a great job, she was very polite and knew her job well
Great
Everything is good except repeated robbing the end customer by 40-50 bucks during each service for "vaccination & sanitization charges" is unethical. A pair of gloves, few drops of sanitizer & a mask which is used repeatedly doesn't cost 50! Covid-19 appears to be a boon for UC for minting money using such novel ideas!
Great service
excellent service
Fraud company, prices are too high
Took booking but never sent anyone.
Not good service at all its been 24 hrs still no technician has assigned for services.why there is no customer care number. Are you all frauds?
Professional team. Very hard working. My bathroom was white and had tough stains. it's sparkling white now. some areas where the stains didn't go in one clean, I requested them to do again and they obliged. Thanks UC and Arvind.
very nice service,feeling relaux
Its a very good experience at UC as the service was superb and exactly on time. I really feel v happy to download this app and get the needy service so convenientlyüëçüëç
Worst service ever ..nobody is taking responsibility of anything..they just keep on showing tantrums .
Cleaning lady was good.. she was quick in cleaning... I had a bad experience with booking, while booking for 2hours it showed I get 30 mins free after booking it it disappeared.. talking to customer care also was not helpful.. They kept asking if I had any proof.. I trusted the booking system so i never took a screen shot. Even when I agreed I will pay for that 30 minutes but No help was extended... I feel cheated... I will never again book with urban clap.. Dissappointed.
The App is not customer friendly. Specially there are no way to communicate when service provider does not turn up in time. Process to call and talk to nominated personal is clumsy. Follow the process used by Uber in their app. There is lack of monitoring the person deputed for the job in case of failure . Reschduling must be after due discussion with the customer.
Worth the money spent
too costly
very good service..I like it
for various repair the app and services are excellent n we know the cost beforehand
very good service in Bangalore.
Getting no response from UC it's been a week iam waiting for resolution of complaint raised for painting services. Entire payment is done and now facing the music. Very very difficult to contact them. No response on mails neither on customer service number. Have to wait for UC team to show mercy on us. Pathetic service levels. Pls refund my mone. Would suggest not to opt for thehe painting services from UC as the painers they send are not professionals and doesn't maintain the quality.
Worst experience.....a guy came and refused to work...Pathetic. Insult aur kra gya apni......

urbin company is developing a God service motive to fulfill needs of society

Govind Mohanty, excellent plumber
üò°üò°üò°World worst service provider We called purifier repairs service man He didn't do anything noting asking for 2000rs we already paid on urban clap app 2647Rs no work done They didn't give refund also üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°don't use guys urban service I will post on social media also you check on fb Insta twitter with my name deepika you are making fool of people
Service charges and the rate card is too high on UC also the service person don't have the perfect knowledge. You need to call again and again for the same work after few months. They also don't give the good quality spare parts.
UC is famous for cleaning after their services. But they didn't clean our place.
Pease do not book a technician through this app. This company in Kolkata do not send efficient proffetionals. The person who came to repair and service are not efficient or proffessional. They only find ways to spend your hard warned money by selling their cheap parts to you though it is not necessary to change parts.
good
Changing review , urban clap doesnt deserve 1 star too , such big application established but not easy way to communicate coustmer care since 2 days am trying to find out way to talk excutive , plz plz improve your application and request to place direct option to talk excutives thats truly irritating
good job done!
Work okok.
Waste
Worst Service Useless ppl. What is customer care contact number? for Urban clap cant reach at all customer service executives.
good üëçwarning
Good
Location service pathetic. can't see any address in Mumbai, Delhi or Noida region. just useless piece of garbage üóë
Not really enjoy the services the professionals comes and do the services and ask for 5 rating with pleading.
Good job
Very poor experience
Had a worst experience today. Never go for the painting service. Survyer simply manipulated sft in the quote and the professional straight forward denied the ask.
i m glad since uc came to kanpur
Excellant service
Do you have a service for water dispensers? I can only find services for water purifiers.
thank u urban clap team
#tryurbancompany the service is so good and relaxing . this was my first try given to urban company the professional is very good at it work and the way they do it I am totally satisfied and happy with the service thank you urban company üíØ‚ù§Ô∏è
Making customer fool only by giving discount. Aur Apne staff ko PPE kit kyu gold diamond wear karwao aur uska charge v customer se lo worst app charging so much extra when you book for any service
superb work. I m happy with his service
They charge double extremely expensive from local services
The worst service experience I had with UC despite of so many complaints got no response. There should be no star option because it doesn't deserve 1.
Excellent work üëå
polite, clean and good work
Service is not great
Mixed experience at times good service but at times professionals not assigned on time and multiple follow ups are needed
Nutan gave very good service. explained the product and process. Fully satisfied.Thank you.
100% satisfaction
good n polite well service
she is very nice ...... Specialy his worküëçüëç
good and prompt service
the girl was very soft spoken..and work done by her was also very good
Thank you for fixing the issues with painting. My home looks beautiful now.
Good service as we experienced
I had a very good experience with the beautician. She did everything with so much patience and the facial was quite relaxing. I would highly recommend her to my closed ones.
wonderful service..profesionals are really great..better than parlour..
Worst,the company rescheduling service without asking customer opinion and needs
Nice worker
very good app
Spare parts and service cost seems to be on the higher side compared to the other options available
little bit expensive but work wise very goodüëç professional and friendly people
Worst experience.. Booked for a house cleaning service.. Haven't assigned a professional and asked me to reschedule twice...
Very bad and company
Unprofessional way of working, I have booked a slot at 6 before rakhii it went on rescheduling by the customer care executive and then it got cancelled as there was no one near by The second time the beautician met with an accident and then now the beautician is calling me after 2 days saying mere end se service cancel nhi huaa....how unprofessional!
got a very good job service
Professional system. Good service.
Your so called "engineers" are useless. They are more of a pick and drop service. They have no idea what they are doing. They use 3rd party servicing and this 3rd party will do whatever the hell they want. My money is gone either way. I have lost more than I have gained(service worth gain) using your nonsense app which is only good for bathroom cleaning. When it comes to appliances servicing, you/your engineers have absolutely no clue but either way burn deep holes(3-5k loss) in my pocket. üôè.
There is no respect for customers time and patience. Pathetic app. And pathetic customer service. Would like to request everyone no to waste your time and effort here..
Money looters in the name of service. This is the 3rd time i fell prey for this. This time, i booked a geyser service and the person do not have the required skillset as it is a branded product(repair person said). They refunded me the 198 rupees and did not pay back the additional 50rs which was charged for corona expenses. I strongly think that the repair person was aware that he could not repair the product from the pic shared before his arrival. Asked me 100 rs once which i anyway refused
good but little costly...by adding extra charges
I was allotted to Rama. She was very patient and friendly and I loved the service.‚ò∫Ô∏è
Most third class app! It's showing available slots. But when I am selecting a slot and going to pay the app saying slot expired! Reh if you can't give service then just shutoff your business! I will give zero dependency on the app!
Bad experience
Great service.....
None of the time slots shown work, I requested a carpenter visit and all slots shown were expired, then why show them? Do not fetch expired slots from the API and hide the day from the UI.
efficient salon service at doorstep
Excellent
keep up the good work
Professional technician excellent work experience repaired my geysar and it's working perfectly now.
it is valueable app
They show less charges initially and then end up looting customers. Charged me 4 times the initial amount i paid
All technician are waste fellows ..they will not give proper service n response ...I need the urgent call from ur call center..
Great app. One stop solution for all needs. I book for bathroom cleaning, kitchen deep cleaning, AC service on regular basis. Also booked for plumbing and carpenter services. People reach ontime and rates are also reasonable. Thank you for the wonderful work done everytime.
Good experience
Paid 1year subscription for haircut, option not visible to use that package, no cust care to contact

Best Service in Best Price
Horrible. .
Bad experience we book the kitchen cleaning which on 24 July 2021. From Raja Kumar.That fellow have destroyed my New Hob. He had made scratches all over on the hob as we have warn and told him earlier regarding this that be careful with glass top do not you any scrub on it. Even though he made the same mistake and there are scratches all over my hob top. Another thing he have changed the colour of my hobs buttons. They were steel in colour but now they are looking horrible. No refunds till date.
No use of online free consultation and visit oppointment charging is expensive(350) without full testing on refigirator not giving perfect solution too.
Guys, I'm unable to contact your CS. Looks like my account is on-hold for some reason?
very good
Must try this service, Urban Company has a professional team
I could not book service, i can only book error they flash. Dealing with them is a waste of time
Good
Worst behavior of the professional.Booked for Bathroom cleaning.There are 3 tariffs in that, I booked the basic tariff. The professional visited my house and told me to upgrade the tariff to the highest one. He denies to clean if we are not opting the highest tariff. Urban Clap is this the professional way to run your business?.
Highly Unprofessional and Overpriced, The Technician Quotes a Random Price whatever comes in his Mind at the time of service. I had to wait for 3 days and reschedule/cancel the booking thrice just to get a TV unit assembled. Finally the local carpenter did the Job.
I thought it's the best in service. Ofcourse service is the best obviously, but the professionals are not good as we expected. They all are escapists. I booked for hair cut today at 8:30 am and was waiting for him, but he called me@8:45am and saying indirectly he's not wanted to come to me. Last time I booked for my Father hair cut, the professional came on time but he didn't put the siccers, he used the trimmer with out intimating. How can UC keeps such kind of waste fellows.
The surety that the technician will come is the biggest USP
I have worst experience in painting project, quotation vs job is different. Customer care no response even complain.Here after i will not take any services from UC .
Waste of money for unlisted services. I booked for plumbing service where plumber visited and quoted unrealistic cost. To put a washing machine outpipe into existing drain he was quoting 1000 rs (local plumber took 150rs) and asked me to cancel booking if price doesn't suit you. Then executive called me from UC and told that this is what our rate card is else you can cancel.
I referred but didn't received scratch card or any offer
The best app for home services
It never lets your down. Good with salon service, AC service, sofa cleaning
Not urban company, No 1 fraud company. We booked an electrician visit for checking the feasibility of AC wiring from the mains. The so-called electrician knew nothing about the wiring. He opened 2 boards and peeped into something. This all took 10 minutes. He charged 300. Damn it !!! Till the last moment, he didn't know if the AC wiring was possible. Onnum theriyadhavanayellaam edhukku da veettukku anuppureenga???
Zero customer support by this app... Beauticians are pathetic and no grievance redressal...
Frauds
Poor service,
Have mostly had good experiences with UC. There are an array of services and it is easier to book and most of the technicians are professional in their work. Customer care unit of UC is also very responsive and are keen to provide alternative solutions where required. Overall happy with UC.
It doesn't give 30%off on second ac service
Please don't book in urban company any service this company is fraud
Poor
Froude company h public ko bevkuf banake pese lete complaint ka koi nahi de rakha or mene apna orient ka coolar thik karwaya usme fan warking me nahi tha new motor lagwai or Deepak naam ka tecnician aaye the unhone 2000 rupye mange mene de diye 17 July ko urban clap me booking li or 20 July tak cooler thik hua or thik 1 mahine baad 20 august ko cooler me same problem aaj 25th h Kai baar tecnician ko call kiya wo phone pick nahi kar rahe or urban clap ke app per koi complaint facility nahi
Help full app
Extremely disappointed with their service. I wasn't able to reach the customer care at all. There's no way to contact customer care as the given options are not working. I booked a Carpenter to repair my bed. The repair guy came and told it can't be done under this section. So he suggested that I cancel my booking. As per his suggestion I cancelled my booking but I didn't get my refund yet. The point is I cannot raise a complaint or contact customer care. As this is a service providing app, they should take care of it.
This app is very important for all persons
good
Love it
Useless app with zero customer service
Great experienceüëç
Good time punchuvality
Good
Pest control experience was worst still cockroach are roaming everywhere.. Waste of money
Professional people doing the right thing at best price

Poor response..
Ro installation k liye 2. Dine se koi bhi technition ku assign nahi karre diract technition assign karke fir cancel karate time west
Very good
Everytime they cancel the booking just 10 minutes before the booked service time. Disappointed.
Excellent
Great services. ‚úåÔ∏è
Very polite and understands what customer needs.
good service provided by urban company but I would keep improving for much better customer experience and keep up the good work
all they did just open say that its need to be repaired for that i am paying 450
Awesome
Govind did an awesome job I really recommend this app if someone is moving an new house
Services are top class no doubt( But all north east girls services are good, Not the local girls from karnataka(they don't give good and easy service, they are frustrating whatever I got)) Once I booked facial, that didn't suits on my skin I guess, i have got so many pimples on my face, like full face with pimples.
Bad service
I booked for deep cleaning but the cleaner just brushed and didn't removed stains and at last told this is maximum he can do. It was worst service. I should have never hired urban company.
Worst company and Worst service been provided. Multiple times my booking got cancelled and reschedule due to lack of resources. I have waited multiple days and one thing you hear from customer support is that you don't have resource
Excellent job by UC
Very bed service.worker deliberately destroying machine
Little Expensive
Excellent job done
Very bad service not assigning propal person for proper timing after cancelling amount not refunding immediately totally wast app

Hey UC, Why don't you start providing services to Aurangabad Maharashtra location, huge potential here, as everytime l face lack of expert service provider of every section, Purchasing power of Aurangabadkars is much higher.. do consider this suggestion... It will ease people's everyday life and increase your business too.
very nice lady
Good service
Worst experience üò™
Not available in all locations of pune
A talented young man.
Pathetic app there excutive are really rude and lier they took money for services and don't turn at all to complete their job my first experience with this app so bad. Unethical business app frauds
They are talking about professional people but in reality they are not sending professional and also not maintaining professionalism. Very rude people are coming. If they have not touch our products then also asking for money. Worst experience.
Update: they called, asked me to submit a screenshot to a link, then hung up. The link doesn't work. No calls since Was logged out of the app two days ago and have been trying to log back in. It just keeps saying, you can't view this information, or some such nonsense. There is no way to be reach their customer care. No email address, no number, nothing. How terrible!
Good
I have very horrible experience with this company I got big rashes after facial. And they are not ready to refund my amount. I have already share pics as a proof as well. I have already mentioned the detailed incident with customer support with my forehead pics as a proof. But there is no response and call from urban company.
Excellent. Thanks.
thankyou
Saloon and cleaning services are good but repairing services are worst. Professionals will use highly priced non branded parts which wont work even for 10 days and when you call them again for repairing they won't respond. Even if it's in warranty period nobody is reponding
Very unprofessional...deleting the app.
Service not avaliable in ghaziabad up
excellent
Awful experience while booking plumber service in Ahmedabad, very bad customer service. They hired local unprofessional people and pathetic service. Its better to use local plumber instead, this is a big headache. I should have never trust these guys. This is a good reason to uninstall.
Pathetic service. Slow app. A company of absolutely unprofessional people. Not following any covid protocols. Would NOT recommend for any service at all !!
Very bad app
Always showing unfortunately no one available to serve you
Excellent
good service
Reliable and Skilled Professional Services being offered.
Worst app for services apart from Salon services. there partners have left working with UC because they don't get their payments. And UC is unaware and simply wasting customer's time by rescheduling with same executive. Worst app for all services (except salon).
WF company..its420 and like dog üí© company... everything...all field pitting on there big hash and mouth....
I booked 4 white washing my house. Thrice I was told to come at the gate but the expert never turned up. Bkg was cancelled. Then I bkd and paid for cleaning along with the membership. The company gave me appointment of 36 hrs later. But no one turned up. I was told to reschedule it. I asked to refund, I've been denied refund of membership charges. What is the use of membership if the work is never done. What do I do with the membership if you don't send your staff. Pathetic is your response.
Chor company h customer ke sath bhout badha frode karti h
very good service and highly professional
service is good, but expensive.
Time schedule is not proper.
Prompt hygienic and professional service
Wonderfull services by Urban Company. Hatsof
I booked for cleaning the bathroom. The person was not so professional. Bakwass cleaning
Customer escalations are not getting solved at Urban company now. They have become big to start ignoring the customers
High charges
No strain removed waste of money
Very bad
Little bit expensive services as compared to technicians charges in market
Repair costed a lot and same water dripping issue happened again within 30 days only. Absolutely pathetic and unqualified repairmen. Total waste of time and money. No convenience.
Good service
one word I'll say perfect
When will you stop charging 99 in the name sanitiser..I thought of giving your partner a senitizer..stopped using..sorry..
Awesome
Good
Very good experience
Staff is not experience at all.
Dirty experience with their complaint addressal...The one repaired and went not able to contact him ..within 2 days of repair problem reappearing ...nobody is responding...big money poor quality poor response ...Its better to contact known and trusted people for our work
Painting service is not by experienced people.
I've booked various services through the app and the best thing about UC is they are reliable.
great support by urban
Booked 4 times but no member is assigned for the work
I will recommend
Very bad customer service very rude behavior executive ..Lack of knowledge..A.c technician md Saleem very poor..overall bad experience..
Cheap products used in facial
Excellent services, definitely I will recommend to every one go through URBAN COMPANY.
(I already wrote a review but not sure why Google play isn't showing it) I am quite disappointed. I booked a carpenter from this app. He came late and said that he will do the job later because it was late that day. He took the money without doing anything and said that he will come another day. He gave me his number and when I called him another time he didn't respond (even though he promised that he will do it). He basically took the money and didn't do anything. I am disappointed.
Charging visitation charges twice for same booking.. trying to book electrician but not booked due to this concern..
Prices are vert expensive
Little expensive.But services very good
Services from urban company are really great. It was very difficult to find services locally and deal with them with their charges. Urban company has made life of people easy. Thank you very much I would request urban company to add services like wallpaper fitting tiles fitting kadiya services
I have booked a appointment for ac service on 23/08/21 next day I have schedule an appointment at 11:30a.m.then in the morning technician call me and told I will be late and I will reach at 12:15p.m.but now its around 4.45 p.m no one came for service.I have call him almost thrice he tell after his job done then he will come.very very bad experience about UC.worst service ever I had.Name of that technician MD zeeshan ansari.
Waste of money
Pathetic
Good
good behavior
Don't trust Urban Company app. I booked for water purifier filter change, first time they came very late but did the service and got all the money. With in some days the water purifier started leaking, looks like new problem arised. I claimed the warranty request, its two days from my booked service slot, no body reached for service and no response from the team or technician. There is no option to call the support teqm, so sent mutiple emails and call back request. Nobody turned up yet.
Everytime i make a booking i get a call at the time of booking that there is no professional available. There customer service team is horrible they do absolutely nothing to ensure customer satisfaction. Horrible app. Need to look for alternatives
Awesome
Worse servie..lost my job brcause of this app..i will ensure the MD reaches this review and will go to consumer forum
thanks urban company
Worst experience ever. My professional charged as wrong after questioning the price was reduced. And he asked me to make payments to his personal gpay account and not to company linked. and we denied to pay it.
Best service provider at home
Big cheating company. They damage everything and leave. Customer care is bogus
Fantastic
.. .. . .
Great experience
Very bad customer service. Not getting a callback since days and there is no option to call them. Very disappointing
good service
Very unexpected service form UC..... Sent an unexperienced boy Who doesn't know how to service the appliance .... And also not done the mentioned work ..... Very annoying and unexpected..... Would never ever use UC.... Worst experience ever
very reasonable and quality service . thanx urban company .
Excellent service. Considered all needs.Thank you
great job ...1st time I take any service n I m fully satisfied...thanku very much
service was very good...
good experience with UC..

Poor customer service. They will try to delete the reviews as well. Don't ever opt for RO services from these unprofessional dimwits.
excellent
No customer service or call center details in app. I have referred my friends and placed many orders but refere amounts not crediting.. Do reach out.
Very professional,very clean and systematic
Nice job
Worst experience ever! The hair stylist was highly unprofessional and I am very very disappointed with the service. I wouldn't even give one star review. My mother and I asked for a trimming of our hair and he shortened our lengths too much and all my hair length and volume is gone. And now I would not recommend the services to anyone. Hugely disappointed.
Worst app.
Good
Kal maine ek cab book ki to driver mujhe force karne laga ki aap cancel kardo.maine kaha ki mai nahi cancel karungi to driver ne kafi misbehave kiya.fir maine dusri site se cab book ki.
They charged 899 for just to clean washing machine? Work done in 15 minutes but some drain cleaning was charged 450 for 2 minutes cleaning....too costly . Why 450 was charged for duct cleaning when it was done in 5 minutes and additional charges of 299 taken for labor charges....another 150 was charged for descaling powder...this is pure robbery of 899 for a small work of cleaning the machine. 450 was charged without any reason. I will never book urban company for cleaning washing machine ag
Much needed app for day to day life , very good experience from the urban company convenient payment methods too
My washing machine was repaired by urban company professional, and after that it's again stopped working,they again visited and resolved the issue, after that again it stopped working, and it happened for the 4th time that they repaired it and it stopped next day , now I am trying to reach them but they are not calling back, I paid 2k for the service and they are not responding back, it is waste of money.
Pathetic Service. I booked 6 days ago, Two times you have rescheduled it. Two days ago you rescheduled and now again telling me to reschedule. Extremely Pathetic Service. I am going to expose this on all social media platforms and ask all for followers to stop using this pathetic platform.
Cutomer service support is poor, professionals doesnot come as per booking appointments and no one take any action, Highly dissappointing!
Good service, hygienic, taken all precautions.
Neat & clean work
I opted for face spa-999rs, which included blackheads removal and steaming . But the therapist didnt provide me the services
amazing app gave and amazing service and also a great discount
This app is very amazing it helps us in cleaning and helping
I recommend Urban Company confidently
When there is discount I use it otherwise I'm not willing to pay AED 59 for normal haircut I'd rather go to the barbershop myself
Goon did plumbing
price is bit High
Looters......

No 1 furad company very very bad service waste time and money sulekha service is better happy service
Awesome üëå
I think the referal is totally fake, I thought of saving the money with the referal thing, but not sure why there are terms and conditions for it, the referal is only applied for limited services, I didn't liked it. There is no fairness on referals
My geyser was less heating I book a service from urban company the service person was not professional after servicing the geyser screws were missing later geyser did not get on I personally checked and found that the wire was loose I repairs by my own... Very pathetic service.. I don't recommend anyone to use the service part from urban company
Absolute rubbish... the app does not have a option to contact the service head or report an issue .. plumber calls says he's not a cleaner and cleaner says he won't clean the Tank .. not his service..
May use AC Services Excellent
grate collaboration, they need to drill down all the services, I have searched for the cushion revolving chair ( Office Chair) cleaning but couldn't able to find the service.
Fraud company , Professionals may be good but company is fraud, I won't be surprised if some day , company wound up and be in scam list. BAKWAS COMPANY
Never take painting services from urban company. They didn't send complete product to get work started and painting agent denied to start work as complete material is not received. Its been more than 24 hours and they didn't resolve the issue and my money is struck with them and you won't even get option to cancel the service
I used this service first time and believe me my satisfaction level is very high about the problem solving capabilities from this team. They're really know what we need. Thank you so much Team for your valuable time and help. I already shared my experience with other people and I also shared this information in different WhatsApp groups. Once again thank you so much.
Damaged my AC..And now not responding.. Worse ever app i have used.
superb
Professional technicians, timely work done, safe and economical! Happyüòä
good
Excellent services. Salon and spa services. Mostly all of them are very efficient and polite..
Good job.
This app is not proper work & requered for apdate mor apdate
I have booked the bathroom cleaning service through the app. The booking was scheduled for 24/08/2021. Professional was assigned for the service. However without any prior information the booking is rescheduled for next day. This is really un professional and not expected from UC. Also I don't see any customer service number wherein I can call and cancel my booking. This is getting worse.
service and the professional experience is amazing
This app is a revolution and provides opportunities for so many people
excellent
Highly professional. Most dependable.
Worst experience ever with urban comp.. Engaged them for painting job.. Payments made in advance... Painter leaves the job incomplete with many finishing issues... Customer service doesn't respond to calls.. Local supervisor doesn't have an update about what's happening... Three full days of complete lack of response.. House remains upside down due to painting... Worst coordination... Sincerely recommend not to use urban company for any service... You will lose your money, work will not get done
I m not able to download this app, can anyone plz help to do that urgently...
very good service
Bad Job now not like earlier
Service engineer didn't have equipment 2 service
Pathetic service..their after service complain assistance is a hoax....
I have used urban clap once but I am having trouble in using aap. I want to switch to classic services but there is no such guidance clearly visible and also help centre does not show options for switching to classic services.
Very very disappointed. It's a scam to try and rip off money from customers. I booked AC wet cleaning service for today. The guy just took it upon himself to check the meter and told us to pay 2500or he can't do the service. He kept arguing for 40mins as to why we have to pay him the money and how we will write a bad review if the cooling is affected after they leave. In the end he called urban company and told them that if we don't refill gas with them they won't do the cleaning. It's a SCAM
super
Mr.surendar singh the rela6 manager did not give services for his family issue lol . Silly services
good service providers
Really helpful in emergency
they have network of skilled professionals, who go above and beyond to get your job done. Really happy with the service.
good work üëå
The professional Mr Rais was good and polite. I showed him a hair style and he did the same haircut. is got the desired haircut.
it was good
it's okay nice
pathetic experience. no help from customer care. spoke to almost 30 of them no help on refund after commitment.
Door step services worth trying.
very professional
very very nice work. Rinki chudary has done excellent work
You guys have redesigned the way service is being offered.
Awesome
Good
People are very unprofessional and irresponsible. Customer care is out of the world will spit on them
super work
This company is an air condition service company‡•§
Professional, perfect
was polite and did an excellent job
Used bathroom cleaning from Urban clap. As per UC, it will make bathroom new like. In reality it is just a normal wash with some chemicals which are not at all effective. I am sure home Harpic wash is better then that. All most 70% strain left after that wash. So think before calling UC.
I booked a makeup artist in Urbanclap for a pre bridal cleanup. This is my very first experience and I was assigned with a makeup artist called Neha, I called her to confirm twice that she is running on time, she req to reschedule four hours from the initial timing which I requested for. Post after also she gave me a confirmation that she will be coming on time. She cancelled the booking in last minute and came up with a new timing as per her convenient, Very worst experience.
Feeling cheated Not an ethical way to ring fence a customer. Trusted and took yearly package for RO RO was serviced and within day output was not more than 500 ml after that one need to wait for 10 min for second refill. I had to travel so was put of station Came back on Friday and blocked appointment for today Rep came and sweetly informed tank is gone you need to replace and it's not covered How I wish should have taken AMC from Eureka PHOBES . I am Retd Army Officer feel sad being cheated
ok
The carpenter has taken all safety measures and did his job excellent
Gr8 service
Service was good, but lot of rashes on my face now, due to bleach, lot of tanning increased, I don't know about products, didn't suit my skin well
The price is too high for spares. could body contact UC
very patient n polite..look into details on the nails.. gave alot of suggestion for healthy nails n foot..very good...
Does the job but you will get good service depends on your luck . Charges are on higher side . Definetily need a revisit on charges .
good service
Good services and best price
First time I booked an appointment and 1 hour before they cancelled it.. Telling me that the Beautician is not available. I tried urban company as I have a 1 month old baby and don't want to go out but very poor service or no service at all.
can opt this service, if you want your product to get reapired at your home
good survice
Pathetic experience with their services,very poor quality,no product responsibility for their own faults,had a very disastrous experience for the first time. I would like to suggest not to go for this app ,based on my experience, otherwise do try and than regret it later. Not even a single star ‚≠ê for their services and customer help to resolve their issues.
Experience of was great, but currently facing issue with address. Only once I booked service for some other city .Need to change address on app .I am unable to avail servieces because it selects address of some other city every time
My experience is not that much good
Worst company
good work
I made a booking from this app but I think it's a lot worse than this app. I think this app is very bad
Best services app of the century
Not good. Response for refund poor. Communication almost not possible
Ac services guy was worst
Update: They don't let you delete your account !! Terrible! Used it in 5 cities probably gave them quite a few lakhs. And now they have bad providers that give last minute cancellations or no shows just wasting your time and bad customer service who won't follow up or treat you like fools. 6 last minute Cancellations in 4 days!! They have driven me to the point of wanting to delete my account, uninstall App and looking for alternatives like Housejoy etc.
all went good I expected
Timely arrival of technician and overall courteous behaviour
App gets stuck at 90%
Very Good services.
Parts cost is to high
Placing immediate attention on service required
need to inform if services are delayed.
Good
I paid for two AC servicing and I got only one. there no option to schedule second service
Not happy.. I got my fan fixed on 9th July and it stopped working today. I never thought I will be paying 500+ just for one month.. Won't be taking any service anymore
Very bad service received and after complain they said I will give u again best service but they give me nothing even not a single call back very bad behavior
I have ordered for hair cut. The person who come to do so was so novice that he cut my hair like that my face shown like I am not that person which was previous one. Never order hair cut. High price and low serivce
the best service company for all your needs. I used their services thrice in the same week.for bathroom cleaning, carpenter and electrical services. each one was too good and was very professional. thanks a lot urban company
Professionals are not really professional. They are just local people and didn't find any professionalsm. I have booked two services beauty and bathroom deep cleaning. Had very bad experience.. My maid cleaned in the similar way with an acid for just half of this amount. I could not even give less rating for them as they were pleading to give 5 star otherwise they would loose their job.
Excellent service provided by the employees.
good
good mannered . excellent service
It was a great experience üôÇ
Azaz did a wonderful job and excellent professional .
Excellent
waxing was really awesome..I would like to call again
nirmal and bapi shipone has done awsome job
It's quite a poor experience I had with Urban company for my last request of washing machine repair, The repair work was scheduled in advance but I received a call 2 hours ago asking to come earlier than the scheduled time, since we had a planned day, we specifically schedule evening time on a holiday to get the work done, and it was not feasible. I later received a call again from another person, informing that due to lack of manpower, we are rescheduling for tomorrow...So poor response
cost are on little higher side
I like your service
Very unprofessional you people accepted request but were not able to assign beautician
Good

good
They cancelled the Appointment on time and without even taking content rescheduled it to some other day The worst service I have probably got If we are to get ourselves available according to you then why there is an option for scheduling Appointment Utterly disappointed
good experience
very good service
It will be great if you'll respect somebody's time and get the services when they need it. If I have to wait for 2hrs for your professional to come and then cancel appointment and run to a parlour at the last moment then what's the point of your services. I could've saved time on my own anyway!!! Disappointment!!!!
Worst app
very good service üëç
Worst service for water purifier. After main service request was booked 2 times of revisit services.
Urban company should shut the shop very unethical and very unprofessional management
Cleaning service was excellent.
very good service.. overall happy..
excellent
ok.
Good
Highly pathetic, the workers that were hired to clean the house were so lazy and lethargic that they did not clean the house properly, infact lied to us that the stains were so stubborn that they wouldn't go, on the contrary we hired a company for painting and inspite of cleaning not being a part of their jobs, those guys managed to remove the stains. We were promised a refund and got the money back in the urban company wallet. How am I to use their services after such a abysmal experience??
nice app
your rates are more than double than the market rates .
Rate too high... better call local person.. who can take 50% lesser..
I have been using this app since 2019, the services were good in the beginning but post covid the service has gotten worse, be it for salons or for pest control. Super dissappointed with the service providers.
Excellent way to get small works done. Very useful app. Most needed. Highly professional workers
I have taking bathroom service was perfect
Pathetic service..Professional was not assigned even after 1 hour of scheduled time and there was no commuciation. Finally we had to cancel the booking. Worst experience, don't rely on urbanclap.
It's a wonderful Experience.
Yep, a nice company, but they commision they take from the workers is on the higher side, they could reduce that & optimise their resources.
Very good & professional services.
Good for home services
Ridiculous and worst company service and customer support, one should never opt for their service, ridiculous
good service
I just got a minor repair done for my Washing Machine. The new practice of not providing the invoice for replacement parts, reeks of a complete SCAM. I believe the technician overcharged me by atleast 300-400 rs, but that's on Me for being trusting of his word. I've had good experiences previously with UC but this one has left a bad taste. Not sure if I'd avail these services again
Are ZTtzd
Poor service at last moment it got cancelled couple of time, very bad experience, they reschedule your booking of their own, not even call back or confirm from us....
Nice service with nominal prices
best
Very bad Service, unskilled Employees
the best app and professional groomer, does the best haircut in no time ü§©ü§©
nice job
Good for professional home service's
Safety and support charges should never be charged to the customers. Totally unacceptable.

Horrible experience and service rendered as the silver faucets paint is peeling off and stains haven't gone from the bathroom floor. Please compensate the price paid or provide us with a free bathroom cleaning service
The app has technical glitches which lead to scheduling issues and professional's availability every single time. The support team is not trained well to actually resolve the issues, they call to say "please give us another chance" vs resolving the issue. Horrible experience with the app. The professionals are however very nice.
Very bad. Not professional at all. Keep cancelling and rescheduling the appointment.
This people doesn't have chat support to discuss problem. Dont know what kind of service is this.
The service which I had opted for was cancelled by UC just 10 min before the scheduled time.
Urban clap is the worst I have ever seen. You guys are most unprofessional. When you have assigned someone to come at a particular time, on what basis do you change it? Who are you to change it? Absolutely unprofessional!
Awesome
Very bad service in Vijayawada No punctuality for salon services Slots provided while booking have no meaning
Do not opt for Painting Services, they truly cheat with u. Whatever shown in their add, it's completely wrong.. They are very much unprofessional in this service. They will fool you. They don't use any modern technology, they don't have any trained workers. They will just show u big pictures. And ultimately nothing will happen. You have to repaint your house by calling other vendor. Please do not trust urban clap for painting services...
Waste service
I'm writing this review based on my personal experience, I have booked pest control service but as per urban company policy they have written they will study of your entire home/ office then they will start the processing. But I got a wonderful professional sleepy face üòàüòàüòà I want to instruct him about the pest location, also he can't able to carry his belly not able to ruine my entire house. Thought of writing a lot but play store not giving space for me.
Unreliable app with Zero customer support. You can't depend on Urban Company. They cancel the booking at the last moment. We booked an appointment for Saturday, no one showed up. When we reached out to customer support they informed that no one is available, we must book a slot for Monday as Sunday is a busy day, even if the app shows open slots for Saturday and Sunday.
Stops working suddenly
Worst company, worst service, worst executives and worst professionals.
Lies.. Misinformation.. no value for customer's time
There is no Customer care number ? If there is a query where to go ? Sent an email but got a reply to check help center !!
Amazing service and total professionalism
excellent work.. completely satisfied..
It's a scam company. Beware of anyone who takes advance payment for a service yet to be provided.
Initially i booked for a service and no beautician was assigned and later i cancelled that particular service.i was expecting my refund amount but i didn't received. They were telling that refund is been initiated and i didn't even get a single rupee with the name of this company. Firstly they disppointed with their delay in service and now with the refund in amount.
its worst to use..its cost is high price to spair parts ..Im experienced for just plug wire to refrigirator is 1100 RS ..,you people think about it for just 150 Rs wire they will charge 1100 RS ..I think one rating also waste to urban company
Good job
nice experience
Chor company
Worst experience.
I booked a salon service and the person rescheduled the service without any information to me. When I cancelled the service to get my refund I only received partial refund and the customer service explained that 299 is the membership charge which is not refundable. This membership charge was added to my cart when I was making the payment and I never opted for the membership.
good professional service
v good
I Booked online and pre paid for the service . Few hours before delivery i was called and informed that they will not be able to do the job even
Excellent experience.
Very very poor services provided, my underarms were horribly burnt by wax and customer service support denied to help or support. Even Pedicure and facial wasnt upto the mark. Poor service, poor customer support, horrible staff. Also, you cant approach them, as no contact details are mentioned on website. Many other better salon services are available Since a week trying to get salon service, everytime they don't have professional, it's been two weeks, just reschedule and no one turns up...
nice work
Lets have a quick cal, urban clap is collecting money frm evry customer for safety fee support,for sanitization and for gloves. per day a technician performs lest take 10 issues that goes to 1000( per issue 100) btw y cust shud pay for gloves and sanitization and specially for health insurance paid sick leaves and for thermometer..its the company that should provide..openly these guys r doin fraud, and mainly technician never sanitizes himself and always insist for 5 star
Worst service by the app. No way you can contact customer care. Referred someone and they did not get the service even after paying. Not at all reliable. Don't use it, Urban Clap is fraud and just taking your money.
very good
Technician comes .. checks the tv (hardly 3 to 5 minutes) and tells high repair cost (‚Çπ7000)..if not willing for repair then he just collect ‚Çπ499. Requests to give good rating and goes....It's a routine in almost every category of Urban company. Same got repaired outside for ‚Çπ1200 and the TV is working fine.
usefull app
They are just looted the money. They gave offers(aug 2021) to book the service for discounted price and I made the complete payment as prepaid to avail that discount. But they charged me extra money (included in the invoice). They said, due to technical issue offer was applied and I have to pay the remaining amount. I came to know that this after service is completed and there is no proper explanation from the team as well. I will give -1000 stars for this looted app.
Pathetic...utterly pathetic...literally Pathetic...no other word can match it well...UC beautician booking is not a service, it is a suffering...nothing but mental torture..
Excellent
excellent work
Poor service
Service levels going down as UC plumbers and other professionals ask for cash to avoid gst in invoice
Professional dnt get assigned on time and services are not provided...rescheduled according to their convinience....
Good Service
Very bad experience.. used other than L'oreal products without our information. Hairdresser not coming on time and cancelled appointment at last minute. I had called atleast 10 time to customer care but nobody response properly. Now somebody of tham called me and without saying anything disconnect call. I hv recording also. Don't waste your time and money.
Good job
I had booked service for window cleaning. The person mr. Jamal Hussain came on time. He started with the kitchen. Within 15 minutes , he said he can't do this job. I was shocked because he just took his stuff and left ! I was very very disappointed cos I had taken leave and was counting on finishing with this work . I hope urban company definitely does some justice to me , and hope they don't keep such unprofessionals. I wouldn't recommend urban company to anyone !!!
Poor service. Technician stole the parts of A.c. worth 3000‚Çπ. Only 800‚Çπ refunded and another technician asking for more than 3000‚Çπ to update it. Worst service . Did not have any option to complain.
Great experience with UC, Best Service Provider in India always gives reliable & trustworthy services.
I'm not able to contact the customer care number.
Not worth Need clarification
Bathroom Cleaning was BAD. I had a booked bathroom (for two bathroom ) cleaning for my parents. First a person named ADITYA SHARMA from urban company arrived with another person (WHO WAS NOT FROM THE COMPANY) they cleaned bathroom with formality then they said they can't clean it and said give us money. Then I said you have not cleaned nicely I am cancling my booking so he said please don't do it. He went alway and came after 15 min . He came and did nothing proper and l am disappointed. üëéüëé
Don't ever book salon stuff, over 4+ reschedules and last minute cancellations. Don't use Urban Company if gou actually have plans, because they will change them.
Provides well trained professionals, all kinds of services available @ ur home. Been using for a while, had good experience with AC SERVICE & INSTALLATION, Bathroom cleaning, Does their job Clean & Neat. Highly Recomended.
perfect service
Worst service ever.
I have booked a service but in last moment got a call call from customer care and informed that service is not possible today.
I booked for a salon service at home and the professional (name: Dhara chauhan) was late and when asked about the same twice she got frustrated and started yelling at the top of her voice and after witnessing such unruly behaviour i asked her to leave my house, she is asking me to "shut up" and starts abusing! Am in a shock that such huge and reputed company is associated with such cheap and rude professional! Highly disappointed, will never be able to book any service through this app in future
Its nice very prompt & clean service but the visit fee not adjusted with repair charges
good
I opted for sofa cleaning .I am happy with the service.
Women salon service is good
I area of improvement, bring an option to schedule services. I should have option to schedule monthly/qtrly services so I don't forgot to do that. Example: Bathroom cleaning, I would like to schedule it once in 2 months. Now I have to come again and I might forget to do so..
excellent service
Steps of facial were good and relaxing.
Such a cheap and cheat! This is the first time I'm using it. I had opted for salon services. No one was assigned even past the schedule time and no updates from urbanclap as well even though we are using paid services! Worst call back service. There is no proper way for escalation. I really wish to give negative star if it was there. Everyone here are busy and not simply sitting at home to wait for ur damn services!
I can't be able to download app
perfect and quality service thanks
When is it coming to Ajmer :(
Waste of money. Spent 10k+ on seepage problem in my house and the problem never got resolved. Their surveyor, supervisor, workers are all on a different page and take the money in advance with all promises to resolve the issue. They complete the work somehow and vanish. Afterwards the result is not achieved then you keep calling them give them bad rating, nothing happens. You just feel you are cheated.
good service
well trained profetional and service by UC.
Very bad service
Local service providers better any day
It was my first booking via urbanclap and turned out to be a nightmare. They took the money without even completing the work and I was left in a situation to get the work done from outside and paid again.Their claimed professionls are actually inefficient and clumsy. Proudly un-Installing the app and will share my experience on other public & social platforms.
Worst experience. A rude non polite beautician visited my home , late by 45 minutes and denied service as I don't have an air conditioner when it was not even hot. When I requested for refund. Urban clap company deducted Rs 300 for going through this harrowing experience. It is a personal experience. But if such people are employed by this service, then I will better opt for other services.
awesome job urban company üëèüëå
Very very bad...the scheduled time was 10 am and it's 12:35 and the team has still not arrived
great services provided by Urban clap
Flawless work by knowledgeable persons at a very reasonable cost.
Prompt response and attentive
Over charging
The assigned professional came an hour late for cleaning the bathrooms and then refused to service in case we didn't upgrade the request. Talking to customer care was counter productive and they cancelled the request without assigning a new professional. Left us in a lurch hours before the guests were due! Horrible experience!
good and excellent ever and emergency service and reliable price. If there is any problem in our house üè† we remember urban company
very professionally managed services and on time services...keep up
very useful
Worst service , request you all don't go for UC service .. batter use near by professional..
Pathetic service...
They don't show up on time.Had to be followed up for ages
very nice
Too many reschudles. For a simple parlor booking it is taking 2 days to schedule. Had to face 15 - 20 calls from urban company. Instead of we paying then, we should be paid to attend all these calls. Just a suggestion, seems like handling this business is becoming too complex for you. Just try with something simpler. Also why evert professional forse us to reschedule?
costly
Above excellence! really liked the service
pls maintain clarity on subject of issue..mentioned fan repair but they are doing just sanity check for that price
Worst experience, Engineer visited 4 time to repair AC but till date not repair 21/08 update - The Engineer asking money but Ac is under warranty.
good app for all the House hold work
good.
Good
If he's taking 300bucks just to clean some debris then this service is too costly
some services are really good. but at time we experience something unexpected all together. but certainly urban company has improved upon its services.
Very Baad
Close your company If slot is not available from last 4 months.no slot please shut down your company
Very Good company
My favourite go to app ü§£üòÇ

one of most innovative and useful idea I've ever seen.great thank you urban company for making my life easier.
Not available in Riyadh!
Good service and Timely Did it
Disappointed with the call back received for an A/C issue service which had a valid warranty
I have a bad experience I have paid a full amount for a Pesticide Package still a visit is remaining I emailed many times no response at all and neither I can raise a complaint through help center.
professional services
I had some difficulty booking all the services on my own. However, my husband helped me and I could then book my salon meeting for today at 11 am.
price too much
Good service
Good experience in uc
Such a pathetic customer service. I have booked a service at 6:30 PM and they have not assigned professional till 7:00PM. Worst is they have not even tried to inform prior few hours and not informed even after submitting my request on their helpdesk. Would not recommend.
1. Worst service done by unprofessionals. 2. Under Deep Cleaning package - dusting and washing being done that too 50% 3. Damage of mica by rubbing scrubs and floor stains due to rusted tools. It's a painful experience ever had with any Professional service provider which completely ruined our house items.
Worst company. No clear differences given in app for different services under same category. After booking, professionals cancels the booking by saying he can't do with chosen service category. When booked other category, new professional says no machine available. Urban company is eating interest of customer's hard earned money before refunding after 5 working days. Don't go with this app
Since I booked my first appointment with one year subscription and they are keep on rescheduling my appointment without my consent as if they are providing me free service really disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
giving wrong information about services
excellent
App log two day liye ho aur apje pass plumber nai hai . Urban company se plumber ks simbal delete kr degeye. This is not good for company.
Many last minute cancellations and rescheduling appointments with professionals that I didn't request then providing reasons that I've found to be false. I liked some professionals but the inconvenience caused by the call center rescheduling caused way more hassle than what it's worth.
very costly
My saloon service money got deducted twice and I have not received refund yet its been 7 days today
They have not yet returned my money which I paid online its been more than a month
It's awesome atleast salon service one can try it out.
Booked Salon Luxe ( luxury experience high end brands) - Wax and Glow Roll on upgrade. The beautician who was assigned did not use the specified product - Cirepil mojito but instead used Rica rollon which is shown under lower plan - Salon Prime. On checking with her , beautician said she is not aware of this product nor did she do pre vax exploitation and post vax 2 min massage which is mentioned in the package. Urban co is charging higher amount in the name of luxury but giving sub std exp.
best service
very good service provided
They are giving good service in all departments which they are servicing so far. Have used their salon, massage and locksmith services and it has been a great experience. Also their pricing is reasonable and helps to reduce the monopoly of electricians, plumbers, carpenters, etc in huge apartments who charge exorbitantly
Nice
excellent service by Stella.Thank you UC for sending the experience person.
3rd class service
Professional, Transparent, Clean
she's very good next time also i will take the service with her only thank you so much I'm glad with this beautician
Bad service. I booked full house cleaning. But the way they clean room and bathroom is not good. I can see black spot on floor, corners etc. Called them but they are telling warranty over and etc. Wastage of 5000 rs. Will not recommend to anyone.
reting problam
ek dam bekar h koi bhi na kre join sale pese nhi dete kutte h ye log ek dam ghateya h yeüëéüëéüëé
Best wishes for the UC team
Charges are premium but most technicians don't follow the protocol nor are they aware of details of tasks mentioned at the time of booking
Fabulous professionals, customer centric approach. I'm a regular customer now. Cheers!
Till now... Very good service provided
Most unprofessional service ever experienced. Cant stick to their words leave alone resolving someone's issues. Harassing the customer mentally as well as financially is their only expertise. Dont ever rely on them for any service.
Bad experience,worst service,dont waste your money ,full wastage of money.
all good
splendid job done.
Nice user friendly app, and thank you for providing us such options online
Very good experience from UC team
good service...
Ms.Jyoti was really polite cooperative and highly professional with her work I would surely recommend her
Worst experience
There is no option or intimation regardingy cashback dissatisfied
Very pathetic services. I was promised for sofa cleaning & they didn't do the dry vaccuming for removing dirt particles. They did wet shampooing. However, once they left and sofa got dried I am still seeing stains which were before. They used hard brush on the fabric and now the fabric looks too old.They messed up my floor. They didn't clean it and they didn't even move sofa a little bit by themselves. I being a girl, moved it for them. Whatever is shown in ads it's totally opposite of it.
good
Skilled people
Good Service
Too high prices from last month
The app stopped working. Not able to book anything. No customer service option. Horrible
Very nice üëç
paid 500 for just to clean the drain
Good service
Its waste of time and not at all happy with the services offered by Urban. i suggest people don't choose the urban clap for any of the services except for Toilets' cleaning. Urban never maintain the quality as well as professionalism, No proper response and The professional who was visited to repair the washing machine not done 100% work and damaged the washing machine while doing the repair. Urban said will compensate but they are not even ready to speak and stopped responding. In spite of shared alternate numbers to contact us always says my number not reachable. I couldn't figure out what is the moto of Urban..... As long as customers don't know the facts and quality of service offered by them they will try to cheat the customers. I request every one to no to choose their services, its supports only to grow their company.
Standard of repair/service has become like any local...just looting in the name of service Wrong spelling of my name, you guys can't even copy paste correctly
Terrible services. We asked for our chimney to be serviced and normally one would think that for 700 Rs he would thoroughly clean the chimney, but he simply started wiping the chimney instead. When confronted about their lack of disclosure the company people said that the money would be refunded but instead they call back to say the can't refund the money. Terrible services, would definitely not recommend.
Bad service. I booked installation for water purifier yesterday. Your person didn't come on time. He told me that he will be an hour late after I called him myself later. And eventually he cancelled the appointment as he couldn't find my place. I had taken off from work for it and he wasted my whole day.
She force me to give 5star and aisi emotional story creat ki uske personal life ko leke ki koi bhi manipulate ho jaye sirf 5 ‚≠ê k liye ..so aaj me 2 ‚≠ê de rahi hu change karke.aap service do ki costmer ko force na karna pde.

I think an amazing idea to get such an app launched! Getting all the services to our door! (specially with the busy lifestyle that we have got)
Excellent, well behaved technicians and good service. Keep it up.
Pathetic performance of the app. Very very slow and takes forever in loading. I have seen it for many months now and I wonder why can't you fix it??
Extremely bad.. very disappointed with the way they behaved by cancelling and resheduling the service.
Good servics
UC makes life easier by providing quality services across grooming and home maintenance. In the last 2 years, I have seen highly trained and polite professionals delivering impeccable services. I have found the app to be very user friendly, reliable and safe, which makes UC as my number 1 choice. Kudos UC team, look forward to more services to make urban living fun and easier.
Worst people urban clap guys demand for rupees....my visit is under warranty but he said kindly pay thru Paytm.
Hi Lehar, Nikhil, Simran and Shalini I have sent the bill of Flush tank and I have paid Rs 500 for plumber to fix the issue created by your staff so refund my amount to bank details which are sent you. Still I have not got the refund of cleaning. Total i should get from your company is Rs 2299/-
Good service urban company
good
My experience has not been good with the services of the company, as well as with quality and services of their professionals. The company has made my wallet UC Cash expired , without reminding in time through SMS/ WhtsApp/ Email, inspite or Covid circumstances. They do not understand this and do not redress issues. It is a loss for the customers.
Very ghatiya customer care
No profesional are there
Worst app ever why mot serving in my area
i recently booked for geyser repair, but some reason rescheduled the time. but at the last moment UC cancelled my request. says that delhi NCR services for geyser has stopped by them. Yesterday on 17/7/21, booked for ac service, now app not working, ac stopped working, I don't like thier ac job. I recently booked for mattress cleaning first day no one available, 2 nd day they insisted me to cancel order, demanded double price, but didn't show the rate card. My booking money was deducted.
Awesome experience. Our AC is working 10 times better after servicing. And hopefully electricity bill will be drastically reduced next month.
I am not satisfied because beautician is too good but uc wax cream are not good .. after wax my hand was feel etching and seen redness full and and feel so bad
ok
Nice service
Great app impressed Thank you
very poor service
Total miscommunication. Used it for kitchen cleaning. Guy who came for cleaning didn't have the information about what all is included. Needed to ask company about every little item if it is included. And I have brought full deep cleaning package. Then after the job was completed,he was not able to complete the job via app which wasted more than 2 hours and multiple calls to the customer care. Really disappointing experience.
My AC was reistalled from one location to my new place of residence. It has developed some problem after two months and 25 days. Accordingly I lodged a request for revisit. The technician refused to visit as the address shown in the app was my old place of residence. Inspite of me requesting to resolve the issue and assign a technician to visit my new address, they are assigning the job to the same technician who is repeatedly refusing to take on the job. As a result, I have been harassed.
Very bad experience for company
The technician who came to repair our aqua guard took it for a day for observation ( this was not needed at all and no one takes it for observation) . When he got back our filter  we noticed there were few changes in the filter. After 3 months of time, we had to get it repaired again and came to know that all the parts were removed and replaced with duplicate ones. Such a waste of time and more importantly our money . Please do look into this and hope you can fix the problem as soon as possible.
Verry poor service no response from the consumer service .. No work done even after frequent payments
excellent
They are taking membership amount and not giving any services..so that mean you have to spend 300 with no use. . Alfter spending 30 min on call they will say amount is not refundable.. I think this is a new fraud ... Taking money form the customer by telling you will get offers on services but unable to provide service ... Wah wah. .
Good
Excellent
good experience.
it's good service
All services are good, but rates of services are higher side.
Do not become a member, you hv a minimum spend of 250 here or else they will not provide you any se≈ïvices, so the first time they entice you to become a member by paying 399 the next time they tell you that you hv to add services to avail their service the minimum amount appears to be 250
Very nice service on air conditioners. Very polite staff and sincere. Takes good care and very competitive pricing as well. Can confidentally rwcommend to others. But covid compliance has to be emphasized.
I had booked UC for Bathroom (2 nos) deep clean and Plumbing services on different days. Had hard time on first day as the partner did not turn up even after committing, but the second day experience was good. The plumber (Altaf) who visited did a "Very Good Job". He knew the issues very crisp and clear, was carrying all spares, did not have any issues what so ever. Both the bathrooms were done on 2nd day by different partners and they have also done a "Good Job".
Pathetic after sales service. Had invested 20k for seepage issue and it reoccured on the very next day despite getting 1 year warranty on it.its been 2 months only following up.no one cared to come and check and resolve.
Trying to book massage therapy from3-4 days but massage for women option is not working.. Worst
Excellent
Terrible experience in bathroom cleaning,he completed the device of70 minutes in just 20 minutes,aarogant person, finally canceled the booking
excellent job
nice
Service whenever required. Done professionally & well.
All good but one will die finding an option to contact customer support to talk for an issue
very good in professional service and please continue the same with strict rules and procedures
Payment deducted.No booking registered. No customer contacts provided in app.
Very nice
it's high cost
Excellent service
I think prices is little high they should do something about prices
it was great service for me thanks a lot Suchitra mam
Very happy after getting your service.
Boisy is very good from UC - hennur
Little pricy but very effective. Great service at a premium price. Let's face it as Indians we like to get stuff at a bargain. If UC could provide an option say like "Good" "Better" "Best". It'd be great. Also, we'd have a false sense of getting something done at a bargained rate. Just a suggestion üòÉ.
Sofa calin k liy kam se kam 3 bande hone chaye
I like the ladies who come for salon services. but urban clap should pay for their travel expenses, products and uniform atleast.
Efficient, hygiene stds maintained, would recommend to everyone.
Third class service team, third class company
value for money, polite technicians, professional service, freedom from market search for skilled technician
Excellent UC services and app also.
Quick, time bound and excellent services
After adding the service I am clicking on proceed but app is bringing me back to main screen please help
Does not work!!
App was crash
Not worth it, too expensive
Good
Excellent service

Bakwas services rendered by the Urban Company.
superb
This app doesn't proceed ahead for booking..stuck on summary page. Please fix all bugs before release
Charges are extremely high, service person insist / misguide to replace parts rather repairing.
Punctuality, professionalism and cleanliness of service providers are worth appreciating.
All their so called "professionals" are not so professional. Twice I have faced the problems with booking from them. They app gives you assurances like "Warranty" and "10,000 protection against damage" but don't buy into any of this, its all a lie. If the "professional" does a bad job or damages your property THEY WILL NOT REFUND YOU OR OWN UP TO THEIR MISTAKE MORAL OF THE STORY - URBAN COMPANY (Previously) URBAN CLAP) is a scam company. They are "Professionals" at robbing their customers.
Excellent
Guys.. Please think 10 times before paying for UC membership. As, I got confirmation from excalation manager Ms. SHIVANI, Its non refundable in any of cases. Beware üôèüôèüôè
Unable to book a service slot
good
Worst app ever with rates
thoda expensive pad gya
Very bad service
Useful only in case of emergency. Otherwise, seems suitable only for elite class people as it is costlier (especially in services like plumbing, electrical, carpentry, etc) because the servicemen generally charge higher pointing (forcing) something costlier service in the App other than the one opted by the public. The service people are generally dishonest to both public and the UC.
nice
Very helpful app
Zero customer support...Stop harassing your customers!!! It's been more than 21 days since my issue is pending.... everyday I have to call you multiple times and I am told that someone from the senior team will contact you and will resolve your issue but no one calls and it's frustrating to see that such a big team of yours is unable to fix a simple AC issue. The weather is is really bad right now and I need that AC to work more than ever...I am not going to use it in winters for god sake!!
Hey, I am not able to book a service. When I click on summary, a membership page appear and after following instructions it redirects back to summary page. Please help.
App doesn't work... Trying to checkout but it keeps on going into a loop and wont checkout.
Extremely satisfied
it's good for ladies.who don't have time for saloon
Use less service they charged u more from market and never follow the timing line just to the marketing without any service They charged money only and if ur lucky u get service otherwise totally depends upon local vendor only
I have used Urban Clap for a long time but now when i am trying to make a booking i get the advertisment to subscribe to urban pro and i've tried reinstalling and everything i keep falling back to the home page. Get better I.T. support Urban company, like what's the reason of making the app if u wouldn't let us place service order.Disappointedüòí.
really a nice experience
I'm not able to book 'women's spa service'. When I click on proceed after selecting the service I want to avail, the app redirects me to the previous page. Moreover, customer chat support is available only AFTER you've booked an appointment. How then do I solve my issue given that booking itself is the problem? Please fix this!
I think you guys have never used your own app.
Not able to club two services too. Also, not able to place order for services. Nevertheless, when I am not able to place the order, what's the point.
Very gud Service...will recommend
Very Complicated to use
Sabse ghatiya aap hai pese lutane ho to yha se bulva lo
Very good service
Unable to download the app.tried Many times
time to reached and service is excellent easy to finding....thank you urban company
I have booked for ac gas refilling on UC in June 2021. It was double the rate of market but i would consider it as if something went wrong thwn there is a policy and we can contact. It went not well and in Aug2021 i contacted UC to get it repaired which is under warranty for 90 days. The UC Support is more pathetic than its technicians. First of all their is no direct number to contact them.and they stop responding too. Its all on your luck if you get the proper service else you've to suffer.
I have raised a request for revisit of technician as my air conditioner is not working after the repair of very next month..... The technician has not come to check and from 4 days it is showing that the job has started..... I have never expected this from urban company.. really hate it
excellent and clean work
i am so happy this service very very good
The guy who came to clean my bathroom broke my hand faucet. Bande ne inform bhi nhi kiya aur chala gaya. 1st complaint to expire hi ho gai aur Urban company se koi reply bhi nahi aya. Aaj jab Banda aya to usne hand faucet ko tape kiya aur chala gaya. Compliant thi ye aur iske liye bhi outstanding due dikha raha hai payment ka. Firstly, I paid for cleaning. Sohit Mistry(cleaner) from Urban Company broke the fuacet. Now why to pay? Also now will have to pay for a new faucet pipe and plumber.
nice service
This was my personal experience. My friend booked a fridge service through urban and had a service. The fridge works fine , and she referred me to book the same person through urban. But the guy asked not to go with urban, as he will do without service charge. After a week the fridge again stops working. My friend fridge also stopped in few weeks. After paying Rs.4380, the guy cheated with low quality items for both of us and not replying to our calls. So think before you Book ur services .
Excellent smooth and superb.
Attitudes get truly reflected when businesses grow and services can not be maintained. I have first hand experience of such a callous response of the service representatives who have at each juncture promised to revert but have only been procrastinating and have remained indecisive. Complaint was raised instantly with the sight supervisor over a week ago.I am as yet patient and hopeful of a systematic remedy to the grouting, waterproofing and paint work at my apartment in Gurugram.
good
professional behavior and good work.
Service was good. I recently did a pest control service, it was handled professionally.
good
Very poor experience. No one to help you if there is something wrong with your appointment. Probably one of the worst apps available on the market. Highly recommend NOT to use this app. The Customer care is useless.
It is very bad urban company company is frod
nice
Having issue in logging to the app, tried on multiple devices getting same error. Please look into the issue. It was working fine 2days back.
The have amazing staff but the company has the shittest options like when you select carpet cleaning they do it for only one side the staff tells you this and not the app while buying it. They ask for extra charges then for the the other sides the policy is not clear on the website. Would rather buy the vacuum cleaner myself and do it.
Kindly send me contact no of Hyderabad TG .we are looking for your help by
This is worst app cheating more peoples
Satisfied with the service ,and guided new things also Thank you.
Just used the service twice but happy so far. Only problem so far is updating my address on the app.
good
amazzzzzzzzzzing service.....keep up d good work
v nice service
Initially I was skeptical, but professional and polite technicians.. would definitely go for future needs and repairs..
Invited my friend to join UC, neither my friend nor I received any rewards. Fake refer and earn by urban
Pathetic experience in ac repair professional can't identify the problem I raise revisit he denied to come and behave unprofessionally raise complaint against it costumer care Defends thier professional and cut call no solution made
They promote stainless bathroom cleaning but in reality there is no such thing as tough stain removal. They were not able to remove hardwater stains from tiles. Local service personnel are cheaper and come at low cost and best quality. For AC installation they did not send experts rather some inexperienced person turned up and it turned out the gas leaked completely after a week of installation. There is no estimation for painting and instead they charge for visit when other brands do free.
good services
very professional and safe during covid time
helpful app
good job
excellent
Excellent work done
Not repair my washing but money taken urban company worst service
Very good service
Just now got the Ac servicing done and the staff was profesional, polite and did the servicing as per the expectations.
You just keep on waiting for the professional....and killing your time
it was nice
Very satisfactory
the app is as easy as can be.
she is polite and good
It's good but most of time we don't get person for whom m looking for
over rated. Worst experiences and too much expensive for small works. What is the point?
Worst app and worst service ,they always give time and take money and you keep waiting from morning to evening but they won't come. If possible I would like to give them negative points. Really believe me it's worst app never do this blunder of booking them for any service
best service
I got the toilet cleaning done and it was done so nicely and professionally. The staff is also very humble and Courteous
Worst app install no
Third Class Service from Urban... on 29th June Executive visited from urban company for AC Service... After one month AC is not working and Now Executive is not picking our call and Urban Company also denied for registration. How that possible without registration urban company provide executives for AC Sevice.
great
Best in class with acceptable rates for services offered
Excellent job done by the boys
Excellent
Extremely bad experience...we booked an AC repair service in south city one Gurgaon on 13 Aug 21, guy named Mohd Khan came & asked us to cancel d service from Urban company n said will do the service on lesser amount..Just want to inform u you these types of ur workers r trying to gain their own profit..Obviously customer needs d service on better rates. U should take strict action towards these type of employees or workers..Its a loss for company..
Its quite easy to navigate through the app & see what services are available & go through its detail as well as book it.
excellent
At my location there no professional available. Still they had taken my membership without coming professionals availability. Fake company
GOOD
very nice service given by Srinivas he is very polite and work knowing person thanks to you and to him also
Nice service
Rajesh is very professional & good worker. He cleaned the bathrooms well. It is suggested that Mild perfume be sprayed, to reduce the smell of cleaning chemicals
excellent & professional service. thanks.
Awesome service, prompt and helpful technicians
Good service provider
good service
Your not assigned any service provider and cancelled my request after three days..The fraud service your doing.please revert back my entaire money 530 + rupees. Please don't do fraud business. Please don't book any service through UC.
Good service. They do their job by keeping their customers at top priority..
excellent service
Per job price is very very high for electrical and mechanical works, especially if travel costs are charged separately. What UC charges for 5 things like installing switches etc. is 3-4 times local next door mechanical or electrician.
UC Partner came and left the job incomplete and since then I trying to reach UC to discuss about the service provider and my money. It been so long I am waiting but I have not received a single call from UC after requesting so many times for call back through App.WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Don't use this app at all.
Left with severe burned marks after getting the wax service done company hasn't even bothered to call back even after sending 100 of msgs on help center. Absolute worst company give a damn about someone's body andlife Adding to this experience it's been 2 months that I am under medication and my life's been hell because half of my day goes into applying creams and washing affected are than again applying creams the marks are still there in my inner thighs and underarms.i need an urgentcall back
Nice service and skilled staff
Poor and worst app don't use
The app keeps crashing and I'm not able to make any changes
Professionals are not following Covid protocol mentioned by you in your discription and for which you are putting extra charges. It's better to go for local services.
price mentioned is uncertain as it increases to unconditional final rates. Need more transparency during quotations.
service is good. but a bit costly, as compared to the quality of service. need to improve the quality of service, especially in west bengal. app is user friendly. customising few services is little difficult.
good
If anything goes wrong in the service, you're on your own. No way to contact Urban Company
Very professional service.
Urban company is very worst service they only send technician for service not for work very very worst service
There is no option of getting help from an actual customer care person, only bot replies
The last resort but definite solution
excellent job
very good for salon service
The person was to profesional
Wanted to give (-)ve rating,I tried this for the 1st time for bathroom cleaning, but did not work well. Professional denied to provide the service for the scheduled visit for cleaning bathroom. He did arrive very late at my place. Thinking not to use the app ever, will get it done with local cleaner as they are cheap as compared with this and they don't have much drama.
very well trained professionals and one stop solution for everything
Their service has become pathetic. I have had numerous unpleasant experiences. Speaking to their customer care is just a waste of time. Better go research yourself for local services. Highly unrecommended.
Worst experience with urbanclap technicians. They are not skilled and running a fraud company. They have taken ‚Çπ3100 but didn't resolved my AC sound issue and when I am asking for the refund they are saying we will not refund you. I will recommend everybody not to use urbanclap services. They are cheaters.
Worst aap ever..... No customer care no is there..... I tried to contact but no response only one msg pop up ur job is complete.....
Please remove all early morning slots. Your lazy professionals don't arrive in time.
Aug 2021: You commented it was fixed. I checked again, its not fixed. This app is unsafe as its accessing my info without permission. Uninstalled June 2021: Problem is, asa i installed and gave my number, it sent me OTP, and automatically picked my OTP. I checked my app permissions, and NO permissions were granted, so UC is not supposed to read. Old review: I dont use urbanclap but i keep receiving its sms with no link to unsubscribe. Please unsubscribe me. .
Very Good App. Problem of Toilet/ Latrine blockage solved very nicely.
I was charged 6500 just for an installation. They changed the copper wire stating dat its outdated n they cheated me. My brother who was doing the same job n now working as a manager in a 5 star hotel in the technical divison now said these guys cheated. Copper is used for longer life n as I didn't know they used me. Furthermore, they asked me to refill the gas, which was also not needed, as per experts, from the readings they said. Please go for some local vendors u know
not up to mark...after accepting order professionals are not attending the order. very bad ..they are cancelling our order by force
I had a poor experience with the services. You charge a high fee & your ads promise a class service but I got an inferior service being a Prime member. I was not at all satisfied with your service. Value for money wise -nil. I like the warranty features.
excellent...must go for it
Good
Untrained Technician only payment professional be careful urban company se
Fraud app they said pls working with us bewakuf bnate hai logo ko bolte h 7 hjar ka kit lo ap selacted ho but koi selaction nhi krte 8 hjar ka saman dete h or bad me training de ker bol dete h ye galti wo galti jabki inka koi nhi beautician koi rule follow nhi krte jo ye traning me sikhate h guys bhot pagl bnate h ye log ap koi bi join mat krna in logo k chakkr me ye ese hi pesa bnate hai fraud h ye log bilkul sub k sub me complaint krungi inko police me
Satisfied with service
They really send professional experts be it for AC service or beautician or for house cleaning work which is their USP.
Not happy with service at all Registered complaint against my window AC low cooling issue they come and repair I paid @3500 for it. after 15 days again facing same problem I personally called that person and he visit 2 times but problem still same. What is the difference between local & Urban engineers ??? Before take Urban company service I trusted on the Urban now I never recommended any other person even I have 3 AC in my house Can I get refund ? Or send proper engineer to repair Ac.
vry Nice nd Excellent performance ,nd honestly working,Sheetal Di
Their technician are not trained enough, they are calling their seniors when they are not able to identify main problem. One of the technician " Amit" he was not enough trained . He has broken one of the part of my AC...After his service my AC is not working properly.
Getting professionals at doorstep is something beyond happiness.
Worst service will file a. Case in consumer court
average
Very bad
Rahul did an awesome job
Urban company is very bad not certified high price work not setifid .....
Services have deteriorated. I cancelled by water purifier company AMC from past 18months. But lately, now non punctual service staff. Technicians call and speak spare parts not available. Urban company can specify the service estimate based on make and model of water filter and let the technicians go through the requirements before repeatedly start calling customer. Technician start disturbing of details etc out of nowhere. Not worth anymore. Service was better when it was UrbanClap
Awsome experience üòäüòä
Awesome serviceüëçüëçüëç
Spa women service good for my mom. Thank you Urban Company
NYC performance Vinod sir ki team Gulshan, meetu & harikant ji ne bahut acche se work kiya ghar main bahut dust thi per jagah kum hone ki wajah se bhi accha kiya kam .
Super
I would strongly recommend UC . Urmilla Mam had been. very polite , frdly and the service was too the mark . Every step she did , instructions were given . All the protocol was followed by her..The facial massage was really relaxing ... Thank you ...UC..
Reena is really good in all the service. Her service was really amazing as well as hygienic.
Baar baar back hoti h
Very poor service. I called it's service for refrigerator. They charged me 3800 rs and the fridge won't even last 30 days. Don't go for this fake brand

good service
Urban clap never let's you down. Professional service, Professional Partners very well managed.
Very good service
rather than going out to parlours just book at urban clap.. amazing work n very professional üëç.
Your service is getting worse...your Professionals are actually unprofessionals. You dont give service on time we book time slot as per our convenient not as per your professionals, they give nonsense reason for late... traffic, bike breakdown, cops caught us etc... If this is the case then I have to stop using your service and switch to others how are new in the market recommending other to switch as well..
I have used their service for A/C uninstalation and reinstallation and service. very good work. Fully satisfied.
Very good Sweeta Yogita Jaya and sampat great job thanks urban team
Absolutely horrible service. Appointments cancelled and rescheduled without consultation. And then they try to justify with some ridiculous reasoning. No way to contact them. The toll free number never works. And this is after taking payment in advance.
First time i got an excellent service. Second time i booked for bath room cleaning two days inadvance(aug 16th), got the confirmation and a professional also assigned (aug 18th 8 AM). They called me (aug 17th 5 PM) and said professional has cancelled your appointment and can't accommodate till Aug 20th 6:30 PM. Finally after huge discussion they gave a slot for aug 19th 6:30 PM with no option. Highlight here is, In my second booking, i even paid for membership and i have seen the benefits prior.
on time service.Good work
good
Karnataka me nahi hai
excellent job guys.... keep it up.... done the job in a very professional manner.... highly recommended....
Very punctual and sincere
Today used the service first time. Very punctual, professional and gentle service personnel. Thanks a lot.‚ù§üß°üíØ
Wonderful experience!!!!! Kudos to Urban Companyüòá
Horrible
GREAT APP SO FAR, HOPE THEY DONT START LOOTING THERE CUSTOMER LIKE Ola uber did, later when they get successfully.
badiaa service hai
Worst experience...
Pathetic service...no way to contact customer care and my amount is also not refunded for the cancelled service. Till now not take any action
Excellent Service Group
There are lot of glitches lately with the urban company. there isn't any option to contact customer care before the booking is made. wrong invoice generation and incorrect details shared with professional causing trouble to customer. Need significant improvement on IT front and communication front.
Why are you charging Rs 50 extra bucks on the name of Covid. You are so shameless people that you are not missing a single opportunity to charge people unethically. Moreover you partners are not wearing any PPE kit and vaccination is running free on many centers. You don't have any right to do so, no ethics just money. Very unfortunate . I will make a complaint against you.
Booked for ac repair and I don't know what the hell technician did, he charged us more than 3k but ac is still not cooling. I tried to contact urban many times but no response. Then I called the ac company technician and he told that none of the issue was there as stated by urban technician. This is complete fraud from urban side... Highly disappointed with urban. Very bad service.
good service for all
Pathetic. Full services done including gas refill..valve. ..AC calling stops. Hardly 3 months passed. Now asking to pay full with reason warranty period over for same task again. Means their work is only workaround and no quality. Very poor. No quality commitment
good
Worst. Still rhe stains are there. Not done properly.
Totally useless service. Unreliable, irresponsible people. It's better to connect directly with professionals
reliable and prompt service with reasonable charges.
The technician are very nice and professional
Worst experience
Good perfect job
I have been trying to book a book a revisit (under warranty) since the last job was not up to the mark. I haven't been able to get any response or assignment, even after several reschedules. Please sort this out and I will change my rating back to 5 again. (I like the app and the services but this is a bad experience)
Other services withe urban clap was good..but off late their service is bad...they don't even have a customer contact number to place a complaint...
Good app
good
The app is fine but literally the beauticians are just so pushy to get you the more expensive facials that it becomes downright annoying. They will say all sorts of things and won't shut up until you actually agree to what they want and that is giving you the more expensive service than you paid for earlier. This results in you paying a lot more you initially wanted to. If this is going to be the case I guess normal parlor girls are better atleast they listen to you one day something.
Very good
Carpenter came, broke the mirror to be placed on wall and just left.. the service was prepaid and now who will pay for the damage I have no clue
Urban clap people are fraud and utter nonsense to the business Never ever opt for painting because you pay for the best paint at a high price and they use third grade paint which gets worn off within 6 months FU urban clap
Excellent Pedicure service. she was very polite and patiently explained every detail to me.
At last moment the professionals don't turn up... So plz don't waste your time.. their are many other very good service app available in the market now..
Don't download this app
Very expensive rate don't download the this app wrost experience
Don't download the wrost app
I had refilled gas in my split AC through urban company for enhancing cooling...after some days I found that the cooling was not proper and then I again raise issue at urban company then technician assigned by this company told me that there is less gas due to which cooling was not proper. After it I again contacted to urban company to resolve this issue then they denied for it. Very poor and unhelpful service...#cheating
prices are now high.
I was unable to get the service done from water purifier companies for more than 48hrs. Urban company sorted my concern in less than 24hrs. I got lot of cleaning and installation services done without any hassle and really good quality of service.
Very essential and useful app for all users please.
Very disappointing service. Three times I book for RO service but still it is giving not repaire. Every 15 days it is damaging. Yesterday they assign person who is on leave. The lady talk me cut call without giving me solution. Very arogent lady. No proper service. If possible I will give 0 star.
Urban company has not yet refunded my amount and instead of adjusting the amount they have charged us a new amount..disgusting...no one is solving the issue...its been more than a month..I would not recommend anyone.
One request u people. Please give us desaigner (tailor) service also...
super
this urban company deserve minus point ....
Worst experience ever .... The are just looting in the name of home delivery ... You can get same service at half rate . Don't get cheated by these fraudsters
Urban company is not serious about their work .They have no respect for customers time.I booked a painting consultation but next day the assigned person told that he could not come due to heavy rain and he will come tomorrow but even after 4 days no one came for the inspection.Very irresponsible act.No work ethics.Finally I have to cancel my booking despite my urgency and I also wasted 4 days waiting for them.Worst experience.
Urban company is very bad not certified high price work i,ve been with Urban company from tha star and it has only gotten worse by tha day...... U r anevel to cancel tha recurring booking from tha app...... U have to call them and contact them to stop it i called ther customer sport 5,time today and 4 time tha phone was picked up ‚≠ê and on 1 wuld speak 2 me . I called tha day before and asked tham cancel and they informent me thay have however they didn't and i had 2 cancel it manually .........
The worst company ever... I booked services for cleaning my bathroom and the men refused to come and behaved badly with me.. Pathetic company and it's employees
Never trust urban clap technician are highly unprofessional they damaged a part of my aur conditioner and I don't know how to get it repaired . No to urban clap in coming future.
Very reliable professionals
Here unprofessional team assign so called professional to serve.
Pls refrain from getting into the trap..they are sending people without doing a background check..they are basically running a racket whr their employees get easy access to people house and then they are looting and going theft...I fell in the trap and the beautician stole my gold while doing facial
Very nice servicea
excellent and approachable
No way to contact any one at Urban Company. I have been charged more than what was mentioned as the bill amount but I am unable to find any number or chat Box to raise this issue. How can I get the refund of the extra money paid by me?
Not happy with the service....totally unsatisfied
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! Worst experience ever. Cleaner didn't show up and didn't even think you call. Very unprofessional
Very poor
AMC Support
nice
stains didn't go from mattress
Hopeless rubbish crooked company. Beware of them. Do not use their apps and services if you feel your money is important to you.
polite, helpful & hardworking staff.
I tried more than 25times to book mattress cleaning with name of my apartment, but it keeps throwing an error msg stating 'professionals unable to locate the address' & there is no option anywhere to choose the time and date of our choice, but so silly it shows a msg 'select date' on a blank page....
Perfect Service
good work
The service has comedown from what it was earlier. Disappointed with the kitchen cleaning.
size of apron for haircut too short
Urban company app is not user friendly.The cleaning professionals assigned to me are incapable of doing cleaning. They didn't even know which type of cleaning option will be correct for our bathroom. No tracking for our cancelled booking and refund.
Worst service of urban company fake company all fake review accepting order then person call and say cannot come even custmer care number is also not there there should be no star at all for these but no option
good
good
i have to enter my address frequently. and make more options and clear options. like sofa seats with back support including.
Even after paying cancelation fee,, if we want to book again they ask pay for the cancelation fee and unlock the service,, rubbish
Worst and worst service provider no timesense
My experience with the Urban Company is not satisfying..as I have seen that your technician visited on schedule time but they are unable to complete the job..May be some time non availability of parts or no response....Should I think that we are paying for your services just for visit...? But in your app shows job completed...What a joke..
Good
Excellent service
The professionals are untrained and the customer support is also non responsive. Whatever they commit are of no use as professional approach is missing especially in Patna region. The professional (Plumbers) will deny to do the rework, will not provide any bill for material procurement and above all if you try to reach out the customer support they will also bluff.
Mr satish from urban clap has performed excelent services
Highly recommended
Please teach some professionalism to your so called professionals. Pathetic service and worst people hired.
appreciate customer support executive. they resolve my problem in seconds
nice service
UC has forgotten the customer handling skills these days.Had booked for Bathroom cleaning Services,but neither did the assigned professional turn up on the booked slot nor did he bother to call up and Inform the delay. After putting up complaint in the app, the call center guy caller after 40 mins and arrogantly updated that the executive will take another 45 mins to reach, the agent was so unprofessional in his behaviour that rather being apologetic on the delay,he just updated in a harsh tone.
satisfied with smile and electrician was professional.
Company is employing fraudulent practices. While booking, they mention charge as X and after service, they ask you for additional amount saying that earlier charges just for checking.
I have enrolled for uc plus membership since last 2 years coz i can fetch some real gud deals through it. The company is always trying to serve the customers in the best possible way.
Inspitemany times reschedule services urban clap failed provide services ...This is fake platform for services....I suggest all customer give them 1 star n make them shut the business
Initially booked person didn't turn up. Highly upsetting. Rescheduled. Next person was excellent. UC should not fail to keep appointments.
Good service
It was my biggest mistake to give paint Contact to urban company, first they make false promises and charge extra in the middle of the work , I will make shoure that deag u to consume from and expose on social media how u guys make fraud with you customers
Happy
They want us to use the USED COVER SHEET FOR HAIR CUT. SUCH UNHYGENIC APPROCAH THEY HAVE GOT..HORRIBLE.
Worst experience
Very well behaved and took all covid precautions before and during his work. well done
Great Top class
Nice Service.Polite
excellent
The company is claiming to provide damage upto 10000 if any damage done within 3 days of of the service. but after the damage done they are not responding to the complaint.
The boys were efficient in their work. Also their behaviour was polite.
It was my first experience in urban company and I got a very bad experience, I have done a ac servicing to put gas in my window ac but it last only for 4 months and I have paid 3500 for that.I have tried to call that servicing person many time who's name is Salman but no use phone is not available..now again I have to spent 3500 for ac serving what the hell..
Amazing service
Very satisfactory and nice work.
nice app
I have no guarantee that whether the booking will be done as per scheduled time. professionals aren't aligned as per the job and always professionals have in upper hand whether they can pick up the job or not. I have encountered 4 jobs got canceled due to professionals are in position to pick up. May be Cleaning Department can look into it and see process should be in place where all responsibilities are followed as specified. Happy to discuss in case you have any questions.
Pathetic experience ...done salon booking since 2 days, no revert ,no status update ...very disappointing
I am using urban clap service for 3 years now , allways they exceed expectations , No complaints , trained and professional workers always .
No proper data showing.....added items in cart not showing for payment...don't waste time of others
It's frowd company
Simply Awesome....excellent service by Dhanjay & Team
professional service
Good app for all the service needs.
Excellent job done by imran great urban company to keep such a good staf
Electrician booked for 1030 has not arrived till 1130. A sad state for your company. We shall not deal with you again. Nor will we recommend to others.
Good Service. Technician arrived on time.
Excellent services üëç
It's always a good practice to send the proffessional's with spare parts in handy or mention the details in the app with the price details at the time of booking.
Never seen this type to service in live
Not happy with the service
Poor work
Nice
I would obviously give reference to others to have service from uc. Very safe service in this pandemic situation. Very delited customer. üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Very very bad experience
I had ordered for plumbing service which the plumber himself cancelled but u c mentioned it as we cancelled and still didnt get the refund after 20 days now
good service
Awesome
Good
excellent service with professional touch
Nice but costly
Save and goodüëç service thank you
try to batter more
Charges are higher than in actual. 750 service for windows ac its insane.
Very terrible experience .i booked for sofa dry clean .under some unavoidable conditions i canceled the booking .i got refund with 100 rs less .while taking up the matter with executives .they said they will send a email on that u have to reply with your bank details .its being a day i replied the mail also but again and again they are asking the same details. They can't even trace what ammt is to be refund .
Every time after booking they ask to reschedule it due to non availability of service agents. After rescheduling also, nobody comes for the service and they don't even bother to inform you.Third time it is happening. Pathetic service by urban company.
My skin got redness after waxing and it's burning.
How can u give 1 year warranty. Ur making people fool
You should start provding gardening services too.
Sabse bekar company hai bs sabko loot tr hai or jo inke saath join hota hai to na unhe kaam milta hai or bs panelty charge Karte rehte hai bs paisa chaiye inhe to or kuch nhi sabse bekar hai ye chor hai ye chor
The quality of service is worst now.The cleaning staff are not trained properly.
Good Services...‚ÄãI am happy with U. C
Excellent work and effort by all staff
Excellent service
services of the company is very fine . His machenic Mr Arif visited my residence and completed the all work very professionally. I recommend his services for everyone
Urban company Assam has the worst of the worst technicians..... Very unprofessional and un knowledgeable people .... have no idea as to what is to be done as per the job sheet.
great app for cleaning. great staff
I had availed Deep intense cleaning for Washroom and the result was perfect clean
Worst experience
I scheduled a booking at 6.30. The professional said she will reach by 7.30, uptil now there is no update from the company nor professional. I think they do it after payment. I think payment in advance is a bad idea. The least a customer wants is timely information if you can't provide the service. Now I called, and the professional said that sje is not getting a cheap auto. Can you believe that? I had to call to enquire. She was peacefully returning home.
The time slot alloted to me was 11am today morning. But even by 12.00 pm no body turned up. And after following up with customer service new slot was alloted . Full day wasted because of this. Pathetic service. No value for customer's time.
Most pathetic service I would have ever tried local techinician are more better and there false promise trying to resolve the issue but never would recommed to use the app and prefer other company as this company isliye trying put money marketing and scamming customer not in resolving their concern
Zero customer care option.
Nitu was perfect at her job..happy with her service.üòç
It's easy for companies to create apps & let the customers beat their head with the customer care executives, while the bosses conveniently mint their money. My order option was inaccessible, nor was the technician or the customer care, and they have the temerity to level false accusation on the customer saying you are not attending the call. The call of their company representative itself dropped while in progress, and they accuse the customers instead. Pathetic
Awesome experience wity their service.. Have been using their services since quite sometime now. Appreciated and recommended.. Way to go!
Very bad company for the profesional.
Worst Experience, I have taken a painting service. I have raised a complaint against the painter regarding the quality of work and finishing on walls. I can still see the patches and old colour is still visible after 3rd coat, as the painter not used the primer. Since last 3 days I am waiting for the materials which is finished and still no response from urban company.
Useless app..no proper customer service..They will reschedule the solt according to their requirements.
rajkumari is honest, very well behaved and good with her work. thanks
Great experience üôÇ
No spa professional avaialble in zirakpur area from so long no action taken regarding that
Very bad service. Most unprofessional
Excellent service
Very nice service
Very unprofessional behavior of employees
Only useless tecnicians are engaged with this company. Worst experience . Will take thrice the actual market value of the item replaced in repair with utter dissatisfaction.
Superb service and first class people...
pls improve your service used products mat use kiya karo one time used bole ke used use karte ho not good
Their technician Sri krishna ran away with my TV and they are not able to give any update even after a week. Looks like my TV IS GONE. Will never take again their services.
This is very nice that the people are getting requiered services through Urban company.Erleier it was difficult to find out the sercive technician for the work Through the Urban getting the all service under one App.
Horrible experience, executive not assigned twice consecutively to booking, no callback received on request, no way to call or raise a complaint. So disappointed
I was a very poor experience. The service professional cancel s the booking with no reason and the customer care team is so rude to explain.
Nice
The most useful n worth services provided by Urban company
always prefer the same
I got satisfactory services ...well behaved person he was
Good and prompt response Workmanship looks Good
Nice
all over good and satisfied
Urban company when u can't provide that professional which I have selected then why do u show them as available. Tum online walo ne customers ka chootiya kaatne ka contract le rakha h kya?? A person book a slot after finding time out of his busy schedule and when professional comes at home he is different, what I selected , he was not that.. What all this going on.. From my side u people don't deserve even a single star... Shame on u guys.
Pathetic experience in booking haircut. Got cancelled twice on the same day because of unprofessional behaviour and poor algorithm. They confirmed my booking only to call me last minute that they dont have any professional for the booked slot. Happened twice on same day. Customer service is of no help,as they just kept apologising without providing any practical solutions
It is nearly impossible to get help when facing an issue. Still my issue is not resolved.
Good one
worst service don't go with professional images they are showing professional doing local...
good service
Horrible.I opted for the "best" service (move in deep cleaning) for 2 of my bathrooms. The "professional" said that they are just normal cleaners who use mild acid and washer powder. Kept insisting to get it done by someone else . In 5 mins my geyser switch gets short circuited and I had to call my electrician, so cancelled the order. He left without completing the job with the acid smell and the bathroom in disarray. Will NEVER be using UC again. Please don't let them ruin your day too. 0 stars
Too expensive
Fee seems to be more as compared to volume of work
Horrible that the company is using the registered mobile number for spamming with unwanted ads, and provides NO way of unsubscribing!!
Frud company
Good aap
The service was great but your website is below average. So this 3 star rating.
best services always
Their service is getting worse. Poor quality service, no one respond to your complaint, no one bothers to resolve your issue with the service, service persons come late by hours as if they are not accountable to anyone. Really bad experience in last few services.
Way too expensive for small services.
earlier had issues after doing online payment. After confirmation of payment from my bank I would get a message saying my payment failed from Urban services and my appointment would get cancelled.
Received honest guidance, which is really missing now a days. Thanks to the UC team and specially that service boy of plumbing category.
excellent job
Satisfactory.
very helpful app when in need
Urban clap is unprofessional now. This is like desi shop.. i had done booking for 12:30 pm In Noida and professional reached at my place at 1 pm. When I talked to customer care ppl, they said, we can compensate and give you 100 uc points but it can be used in next booking, because it is pre-paid order. It means, I have trusted uc and paid in advance so its my mistake. not recommended at all..
All my services be it hair cuts, skin care as well as pest control were top class.
Terrible app. After we've spent 20 mins in choosing the service, it tells us during checkout that we don't serve this area yet.
awesome service
Given full time and do well work
Fast service with skillful people under their supervision! Been using their service since they launched in Hyderabad üôÇü§ó

Is there a way to reach ur customer care. It seems not to user friendly from ui
Very happy with their service. I was given resolution even after the warranty had expired
Professionals are never on time and extremely rude, specially the salon services.
Customer friendly, good and efficient staff deputed for asked service.
Urban Company is one of the regionable and quality service.
To good service
Doesn't deserve a single star. I booked a cleaning service and since last three days the service has been rescheduling as the persons who's are supposed to come thy are not coming on time and also giving silly excuses and forcing customers for changing nd rescheduling, even after complaining so many times no improvement can be seen. I am totally sick , thy claim for best service but it's pathetic, plz don't take its membership they avoid those customers
Pathetic there service. they overcharge and they just deduct the money without any response.
After availing other service I still have the same issue over the years. UC is not at all accessible for queries and clarification unless you pay upfront. Very unethical practice. Useless Support. They are following this latest fashion of cost cutting by removing their call center number. Expect delays and time waste If you are using urban company and by any chance if your order doesn't get listed or if you have a problem good luck with getting any kind of support.
they are very punctual and make us feel comfortable
awesome
With the trust i requested for sofa cleaning service. In the advertisement they promise they would come with professional equipments like bosch maschine. But when the technician came with alocal maschine and with attachements missing. When i talked to cc they say they can provide this only. I was amazaed and appaled at such false promise and advertisement. Avail service at your own risk.
Awful EXPERIENCE .... just waste of money... they don't even know how to clean fans ... I wish I could up laod pics after the final product Looks Roadside labour's we're given uniform and chemicals no training imparted to them about cleaning....
Had booked deep cleaning services for my home..the guy did not turn up only and inspite of repeated calls to the company and the vendor,they just didn't respond.pathetic services.uninstalled the app after that.it was a very bad experience
Excellent service!
have been using urbanclap for a long time now..fully satisfied with all services be it saloon or house cleaning or repair work. you guys truly have skilled people
Good of
Very good service. I am more that satisfied. The extra money is really worth it.
If Urban Beggars get your number,they will daily ask for money by msgs. Don't you ever call them.
awsome app and helpful for now a days generation
I love this app
good service
Love ur services
This is worst. at 8:30am I booked for service and noone reached and someone called at 9am and told that they will reach at 10 to complete the service again called,informed they are not coming.WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THIS
Facial was done really good....app facial massage
prices are a bit more
Good to get services at home at reasonable prices !
I am really disappointed wth the service. Today one professional pulak mondal has come to service my geyser. He doesn't have the knowledge of this work. He has broken a part of my machine. Lastly he has admitted that he is AC repairman nd doesn't have the knowledge of geyser maintenance. I want refund of my broken part immediately.
good
My experience with Services offered by Urban Company partner is very poor. Service booked on 3rd Aug is yet to complete.Despite repeated reminders Customer care is also not responding properly. I advice not to prepay for any service otherwise you may need to follow up everyday until the services are rendered.
I'm ac Professional And Thank You.. Urban Company.....
We have booked painting service and they showed us a really good dream of fast and hasel free service.. work will be great.. but doesn't seem anything happing.. my house work is been stopped in middle due to material is not been sent to from last 3 days.. company is stuck with some policy loop and here we are suffering all house is in mess. We can't take a proper sleep. I will recommend go for traditional option atleast work will not stop due to such policy issue.. they don't care for customer
Nice
I have been trying to reach customer service...there is no way i can contact anyone.. i have subscribed for annual pest control and paid 4k.. n i cannot contact anyone as one of the visits is due.. twitter urban company support is of no use.. no response.. i need solution to my problem.. need a contact to reach out.. app doesnt provide anything.. help center does not have any option to chat or talk to customer service
Very poor service and too expensive. Money minded.. never book with them. It's better to approach some local service centers who will be much honest and professional.I booked a cleaning service for my AC. Two guys came and did some gimmicks without cleaning the AC. They asked me to pay 324 Rs as a visiting charge for not doing anything. Please do recruit some skillful employees rather money suckers.
Hair dye was incomplete though it was my product, also full cuts on forehead after threading...it was tremendously paining on forehead..kindly provide option to upload pics..we demand a call back as soon as possible Full bumps on skin after RICA waxing Unhygienic..uncleanness...never recommend.. Urban company waste of money..never trust them.. highly UNPROFESSIONAL service..
Full House cleaning of no use : 1.come hours after appointment (appointment for 1 o'clock, after repeated follow ups came at 4:15pm) 2.do not clean properly (use same dirty cloth without cleaning them) 3. Incomplete work (left out lofts, balcony, doors, light switches, lights etc) 4. Left mirrors very dirty and foggy 5.water stains bathroom tiles not cleaned 6.Floor not cleaned properly (all dirty lines on the floor after they cleaned) BAD EXPERIENCE, WON'T RECOMMEND, WASTE OF TIME & MONEYüò°üò°
Good aap
facial by Seema was excellent
v nice experience.good service..
Great service! Skilled professionals and amazing customer support.
excellent
urban company is costly
Lot of scope to improve in terms of co-ordinating the alloted hair professional or beautician(salon services) and the customerüëé They need to call back the customer within 15 min. maximum when he/she has requested for a call back..Delay in such cases is unacceptable & unfair to the customers.They are quite daringly alloting non-vaccinated professionals too even after extracting Rs.49(money for vaccine-safety,sanitizers for the professionals) from the customers.
Awesome service .
Horrible. They do not get back when there is a problem. Had very bad experience
Technically strong and good service
As usual like other app. No special things, however more or less experience not bad!üôè
My main issue is not resolved, Dripping in indoor unit, even though I had informed technician about problem, but he was unable to rectify the problem asking me to book for another technician by paying extra for water leakage repair....it's horrible, I had paid higher amount for full AC serving, isn't it logical that servicing mean to rectify all problems of Air Conditioner....even customer care is not bother to resolve issue, she gave me call & disconnected by saying she'll call back in 5min....
Looted by plumber rs 3000...urban clap looted 6000 rs worth of my time...no solution...
It has happened for the third time that the executive has not been assigned for the service. That too I had to complain for non assignment of executive. There was no action from the company. Pathetic. Had to cancel my program to schedule the service but in vain as no one turns up. Not recommended at all.
Worst AC service
Good
good
Superb convenience. Competitive pricing. expert professionals.
professional... he diaognised the problem in three minutes n the problem was solved in 10 minutes... BRAVO
Grateful to UC ,it resolves all our problems and covers day to day needs.Highly professional and very punctual.
Worst u guys provide wrong information thru SMS.. it happened twice
I booked for service but the agent assigned to me didn't arrive at the location. His number is not reachable. He neither tried reaching out to me nor was he reachable. The support function of urban clap is pathetic there is no possible option for a customer to call the help line line number. I raised a query for call back and it's been more than 1 and half hour I have not received any response from them. I must say one should not be wasting their time for the hopless service
great app
Prompt and reliable service.
More Expensive.
it was a fantastic service provided by urban company
Salon services are near and clean... No mess up at home to clean afterwards. Well trained employees and their behaviour is polite.
Urbanclap or urban company is awesome. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Very satisfied with the services offered by Urban Company.
Very papuler
Item not used original. Technician changed R O pump wich coast was 1999 tanken by me. Which was not UC brand.what I do?
Pathetic service. Twice out of thrice I availed the service and had to repent for it. Had requested call back 3 hours back still no one has bothered to call yet. App does not have option to call to their customer care. Ridiculous. Hope I don't use their service going forward.
Unable to reach customer care. I have not received my refund amount even after 15 days.
professional work provider. expected work done every time.
Pathetic Quality of work...will never recommend anyone to Urban Company.Highly highly disappointed.Popr customer service
Very poor...the technicians are not 5 star rated...i call them for AC service they damage my AC PCB circuit because they dnt know befor service PCB circuit was covered by polythene....they dnt cover it and water goes in circuit...for repair they want 4000-5000....this is totally unfair with me...they dnt have any way to solve my problem ... Sorry but very disappointed...call them at your own risk...
good
They r not co-operative
There is poor customer service, we are unable to reach them during the last service where I did payment and no person assigned
Good
Good service company
very good üëç
Not able to add address, not able to repay,
Worst service
Its a wonderful company and their assistance level is too good.
Ved Exprince
Excellent and expert service provided.
This app doesn't work.In Assam I could only book once.
Charges are very high, one ac installation total cost is around 5000
Urban clap ppl are cheaters..They say second time booking for same issue has warranty and it's a free visit and after we scheduled a visit they call and say it's not free since there wasn't any issue with the appliance. The customer executive wasn't ready to listen to us at all.. Expected better service from you guys..Don't cheat your customers..
Bad Experience
No feedback mechanism available
One stop solution for all needs at your doorstep.
Excellent experience with hair cutting. Not only the hair cutting was done well, the professional followed all safety norms and cleaned the area before leaving. The whole service was an excellent experience for us and has instilled the confidence for urbanclap.
Good
Worst service ever had
she is very polite and professional.
very good service and approach also it's good people
Excellent app I appreciate very useful and love it
Ealier have got ac repair and ro repair and toilet cleaned i have good experience
Useless company
Such a pathetic company, totally unprofessional. They take payment right away and book slot whn they don't know availability of their beauticians. On top of it they lie. They rescheduled my appointment twice on a same day at last moment saying they are still trying to find professionals then they rescheduled for another day but still their beautician didnt arrive and called me saying they can't find my location, which btw I sent on their WhatsApp thrice. So many calls but no one showed up.
good work
Given a chance I won't give then even a single star. They rescheduled my booking from 12:30pm to 5pm without my confirmation and that too at the very last minute. There is no way you can contact them. Feel sad that I booked services through such a company. Won't recommend them and will share my feedback everywhere.
Inspite of booking a service 4 days in advance, the professional refuses to take up the service half n hour before, reschedule it for the next day to hear the company agent call and say they can't make any arrangements. I was a loyal customer but not any more. Worst experience, can't trust these good brands also now. Call center doesn't respond after multiple calls and messages.
He did a good work
Very good .8
service was excellent üëå
very fast service but cash back offers are very limited.
Great service
Worst Service I have ever received from them. Guys please becareful while booking bathroom cleaning. I strongly recommend not to opt for this service. They even damaged my property and finally refunded my amount, but that doesnt help anything once property damanged is damanged for ever and it cant be replaced. So I suggest not to go for it and think before you book other services aswell. Please do not suggest for your neighbours aswell.
Worst experience ! Will go to consumer court against them!
This app should be removed from Google Play Store. The company is unprofessional and they waste the time of their customers by scheduling and cancelling services at their own will. I have uninstalled this app, and I will not recommend their sevices to any one
logged out and uninstalled in 5 minutes. I couldn't find the checkout page after trying and searching many time ..page keeps asking me to add services worth 1300 rs more to be able to checkout . Maybe will try webpage of Urban Company.
timing is important
nice service
Excellent Service
good
so good
Fantastic
After listening to stories from your professionals I feel you need to have a better HR team. You need to treat these professionals like people instead of machines. The app is good though the packages are not that creative and appealing.
Pathetic service...
Very bad service by beautician she has erased my eyebrow and dont take service request you after pandemic first time I called almost two years very bad and she has not apologized too and left. Her name is sridevi chennu
No chat box ton consult
Price hiked and services suffer. I have used their services since December 2019 and just recently found out that thay have hiked all rates. Previously there was just one option for bathroom cleaning where you could add as many as you wanted. Now, to charge more they have created slab within that and are offering minimal services for same price as before. If you want the same service you got earlier, you pay more. Just ridiculous how profits will mark the end of my relationship with them. Bbye UC
They say that they have escalated the case to higher management and issue will be solved within 24 hrs but you will never get callback you need to chase them 1000 times
Good service
Pop was not available with staff and was not mentioned in the website.
I wish there was a customer care so I could call and ask some general questions. My query is I need only single door painting. How much they gonna charge in Bangalore
Service warranty is a fake thing Booked termite control and got it done on 24 june 2021. Got the termite back in 1.5 months. Supposedly there is 3 month warranty. But worst part is there is NO OPTION at all through which Incan raise this in app. No customer care no.. no email id.. and no option to report against the booking.. Horrible this is
service by UC is really very good.
Adding time slot giving issue
An app with almost perfect well mannered people, with good experience. Very rarely had been the occasion that I got disappointed with the services. Totally recommend..be it salon or and electrical or plumbing help. Its a good platform to get the professionals.
Worst service offered. Booked for hair cut at 7 am and thr professional didn't arrive till 7.30 am and when asked he said you cancel the booking. He himself canceled and it got rescheduled for later time. Then what is the need for booking if you want to come at your convenience? Pathetic and will not recommend
Best service in raipur
Plumber and Carpenter experience not good. Their attitude was good but the work is B class. Need to call them back to correct what they did wrong.
Horrible experience with bathroom cleaning, Mr. A Naresh did not clean the bathrooms properly at all, stains did not go at all, utter waste of money, very annoying. Never going to book again. No Deep cleaning done
Very bad experience with Urban Clap. Will never use their services. The technicians are not experienced in my case it was an AC servicing which went from working to need repair after their technician worked on it, Customer service and support team was not helpful.
Cheating in disguise ... there was water spillage from my AC... The guy came fixed it and said coolant pressure was low (100 instead of 130) ...after complain the same guy was sent ...and he agin measured the pressure to be 110...gave a complete description of the issue on app ...which is not showing anymore This is unfair and classic case of cheating ...beaware of these guys
Very worst.‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æï ‡ÆÆ‡Øã‡Æö‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Æ§‡ØÅ
I had a very bad experience, booked beautician twice but had to cancel as she did not turn up, one day had personal problems and next day was celebrating nagpaanchmi, Actually very bad work ethic of the workers. Urban clap is requested to look into this or it will ruin their reputation.
I had high expectations, highly disappointed
The lady used fake product of RICA and did waxing. Lied to me bluntly saying it's RICA. She also injured my eye lid while eye-browing. Inexperienced and horrible professionals. And after submitting query and requested for call back thrice but no response from UC. Will never ever recommend it to anyone.
West app
Worst experience regarding Bed Bug.Few days it wasn't there,again it started...Truly waste of Money..Plz dont go for it.
very good at addressing all your home needs at one place with convenience and comfort
nice
They are just a fraud company. I called them for AC non cooling issue. They came and charged 7000 Rupees and changed whole lot of parts and even gave a verbal guarantee of 2 years but couldn't sustain for 3 months itself. The number of technicians is switched off and you can not send a complaint to UC. Please change your name : Ultimate Cheaters
Great Service Always !!
excellent work
Chor company
Amazing service
Visiting charge is very high
Great work done
Every time worth servicing through urban clap
Amazing services
Worst app
this is first time I have used service of UC, VERY PROMPT GOOD SERVICE,
overall great experience ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Nice app
excellent
product was not so good as seen at video
Horrible experience with kitchen cleaning services. Damaged the quartz countertop. The customer service experience was further disappointing. Even after admitting to the damage, customer care kept on insisting for a bill of a repair work when the damage was irreparable. The only way to fix the problem was to replace the entire slab. the damage warranty is just a name sake warranty.
Work done by Ganesh very nice and appropriate.
satisfying
Urban clap provides customer feedback of 5 star and 4.5 star customers only. He must publish all reviews or random reviews under urban clap customer feedback.
Sonal was too good. she had perfect skills for facial and pedicure
There is no chat email or contact number for getting any sort of help/ clarifications in booking a service.
Worst custom service,worst professional.
Don't use Urban Company for painting work. Pathetic service. All false promises. Patches are scene on wall even after painting.
its awesome
I don't' know
super App n services
wax quality was not good this time .wax was not happening
Really it's a very good experience im happy Good luck urbanüëç
Not on time every time facing problem with the time management issues
Great user interface and service.
wonderful service by Beautician thanks to urban co
Prompt service‚Å∏nice and prompt service
good app
goob
Rates are too high. Their service employee was came and ask for cancellation of service request to do the service on private basis. Taken 1500 for AC gas filling. Now feel cheated as AC does not cooling. They were unprofessional too. Hired private vendors on commission basis. Worst experience ever.
I've been with urban clap from the start and it has only gotten worse by the day. You are unable to cancel the recurring booking from the app, you have to call them and contact them to stop it. I called their customer support 5 times today and 4 times the phone was picked up and no one would speak to me. I called the day before and asked them cancel it and they informed me they have, however they didn't and I had to cancel it manually and was charged a late cancelation fee. This happened twice.
Not worthy
no direct customer care number
Very very bad experience. First of all the booked professional calls n says he cannot come because he is not well n with the same booking another professional will come. Anyway they cancel the booking without asking and initiated a refund which will come in a weeks time. Thn they give me another professional n he calls n says I can't come on time so you pls cancel the booking. Thanks urban clap for wasting so much of my time n effort. If I could rate you zero I would .
Service was good but when you opt for claim warrenty service.They will change the details in the app and service repair man do not even show up. Even costumer support won't reply back after 3 days.
Great service
rachna kumari was done very good massage really best
very good ser
Technicians are unprofessional, untrained and unethical..
The person was rude and did not know what kind of work to do and he was not well mannered also..why do you keep these type of people who don't know how to do work...and showing attitude..and why did you take my booking when he was not interested in doing the work..His name is Bappa Sardar.
Very useful.
Horrible @ cheating attitude of your workers @ They are coming& doing for photos only @ first they are selecting wash basin inside & one or two taps., they are cleaning that much only, uploading pics & going @ yesterday that lady horrible work @ she had done the job where the pics taken @ bottom surface of wash basin, 3 taps 50 % only cleaned @ bath room floor near door cleaned, remaining untouched., neat walls visible portion done & balance left @ MY ADVICE ask customers to upload pics
Worst service
Horrible service. Never on time.
There is no way of contacting UC, except their set questions which are irrelevant to customers.
good job
Worst people assigning people to clean but not coming properly
Worst experience . After paying full amount I got call from UC that due to wrong invoice refund is generated so please give that amount back. I told them to give me transaction details. They refused to send mail and instead they send the guy like recovery agent demanding more money.
I'm happy
Good services
Kaleelpasha....uc

Excellent App, a boon for people who want hassle free services at their doorstep. Keep it up.
This is the message I received from you on 3rd August, 2021 "Dear customer, your amount Rs.1448 /- has been initiated for refund. It will be credited back to you within 7 working days. Thanks Team UrbanCompany" But I have not received my refund till now. Please explain C S RAO ADVOCATE
Very bad experience
Good
Hi everyone, Jyst to inform u all that i booked services in urban company and paid them also and they suppose to assign me beautician and i paid 666/- and they couldn't able to assign beautician so i said please cancel my booking. And i asked for the refund they said within 5 to 7 working days it will credited to ur account.So this is did in 18th july so i supposed to get my money by 27th but right now its 12th aug. Still they didn't refund. Plz help me i am calling,messaging no respose.
Highly Disappointed
Worst app and the people working with it are also thief
Poor servicing of ACs. Had to redo a lot of fixes (gas leakage and refilling) after 4.5 months. For all else good.
Very Good Servu es infact today's expert Mr. Sonu Kohli was too good n passionate about his work.
Worst app ...worst service...worst customer care
Good service
Booked sofa cleaning. The payment failed on the app and money was returned to me. I called the customer support to find out what next and was assured that the service is still booked and I will need to pay on completion of service. Have received no confirmation of service executive on the day of the service. When I tried to access the help feature in the app, nothing happens. It keeps going in a loop where no help options appear. I took a day off from work for this. Mighty unhappy!
Pathetic kitchen cleaning service...it was all messy and the boys were in hurry and not at all satisfactory service.Its better to pay a daily wager and get the service done
Very good experience
Waste of money and time.Urban company has Non qualified service vendor, not able to identify and resolve problem, they asked to call product service center saying we are not support inverter washing machine. If they not support then why urban company claim for all service solution. My advice go for company provided service vendor instead calling urban company as you will loose money without getting service. Worst service.
RATES LITTLE HIGH AND NOT OPERATING IN ALL CITIES
why do professional has to carry pedicure tub for cut file polish,why do they have to show start time end time.very disgusting questions.Not satisfied with ur foolish questions.
Very bad experience with services. 1. Cleaning service no deep cleaning. Very expensive. 2. Had worst haircut, left hair small and right large 3. Waxing at home person spilled wax on my floor. Had to remove it with blade and it took one month.
Service is good but first they give us discount of 100rs n then take 48 rs for PPE kit n other stuff from us where as the cleaners did not even wear the PPE kit at my place then why should I pay for it
My ac service was under warranty period and I booked revisite of the technician availing the warranty. In the app charges was show zero rupees but visiting technician charged me 500 rs cash stating that this is visiting charge.pathetic experience I will never book anything through this app. They are frauds
My Plus Membership wasted, I gave my fan to a electriction 1st week of nov and till now he hasnt returned it . As well as he is ignoring the calls and Company are ignoring the mails. Trusting them with your goods further will be your biggest mistake.-Victim. After Mails and talk with customer care in conclution they took professional side and i lost my asset and no compensation was provided. The worst experience in my 4 years of using the app.
excellent job I very happy
Osm.
Excellent app for any home needs
This is so disappointing. I had gotten my AC repaired on the 31st of May (paid 3000) and it has broken down withij the warranty period. The company is not responding, the technician says he has left UC. they are cheats, trying to save themselves of the within-warranty repair.
Very bad really disappointed
KOI BATA SAKTA HAI KYA... CHHINDWARA MP MAI YE SERVICE KSE START HOGI
Very very good service
extremely happy with this app
Urban Clap has improved significantly in last couple of years. I can say this confidently as had availed their services when they has launched, when they rebranded and since the pandemic. Utmost care taken to tain their professional staff. Safety measures are followed. Thank you Urban Clap team for your focus on quality and service standards.
Specially for TV technician
Useless app
Awesome experience
very good
If anyone visiting this review page then trust me i have faced the worst experience with Urban Clap. Don't ever make any booking through them for anything related to your work.. They have a potential to make it worst for you. Never they call you nor they get connected to call and take payment all in advance and at the end it make customer experience horrible.
Gud services
I just want to know that do you people also provide leather sofa cleaning service. If yes please let me know how to book it through your app and service details like; cost and procedure of cleaning.
professionals who educate the customer and maintain transparency. excellent job
good
Shuddh pani k naam par , urban company bhi Tripathi ko loot rahi hai...........LOL, wo bhi exist water purify company se jyada. YAKIN NAHI HOTA TO RO SERVICE BOOK KAR K DEKH LIJIYE.
Best manpower services
A satisfying experience.
Excellent app. No glitches whatsoever and does exactly as it says.
The company only wants money, it is not providing service to us on its given time Very very unprofessional ......still waiting for service ....not on time.
Well behaved beautician and services also excellent. We want make up option in urban company
Nice service after getting I feel rejuvenated and fresh.
Very nice experience. Instead of hunting for local guys without any guarantee of quality, one should try Utban Company.
They don't care once the service is done, if at all the same problem comes back they say they have insurance of three months but what they do is even if you contact in those 3 months they will not contact you,but they will contact you exactly after your insurance time ends, Is it not fraud
very good service
No professional approach at all. Team is absolutely useless. Prefer someone local instead of hiring these people
Covid protocol maintained. Good and neat work. Visited before time for the call to make preliminary arrangements. Excellent work from Urban Clap.
Absolutely worst service. They reschedule as they wish. We are paying customers.
good job. well experienced and hard working girl.
excellent service
Very good service. Trained professionals. They clean all the area after thr service is complete. I have been using this Service for more than 3 years. Never got a chance to complain. It would be great if Meson services are also offered. The App needs some small improvements. There is no provision to write any query or feedback. Also no provision to type minor changes in address than the suggested location from google.
Naseema was too good ..loved her job..
Pathetic service. They have left the garbage at the door and left. No action for 5 days inspite of reminding Very sad experience. They wait for the warrenty period to end and after that don't pick up calls This is what happened to me. Your people dumped the garbage outside my door and did not remove it I had to take outside help to do it Your service is so poor and on too of it the response here is oathetic
nice
The people they send are mostly fraud on top of that Urban Company takes no responsibility for anykind of Damages being done, these people are coming at your home hence they know a lot about your home, your family's security is at risk because of these people. Their AirCondition installation guy damaged my AC and when I complained he personally visited 4-5 times at my residence, I had to alert my security guards to get rid if him still Urban Company didnt care about the issue
Experience for home cleaning service was pathetic. It's too easy to book a slot and pay, but app should instead provide interface to schedule a visit to get cost and effort estimate before booking appointment. Got slot for same day but after scheduling challenges and lot of delay it was moved to next day. A supervisor came in the morning and then claimed that it will take more labor and whole day, hence said to move it to next day again while doubling the cost. Cancelled as weekend was gone.
good service
Don't use urban clap that's all... After that your wish
Simply handy and great service
Excellent. Amazing hygiene. Haven't experienced abroad.well done.
very nice
Best app for our daily needs in our hands, everyone must have this app it's useful and also economic, user-friendly.
I have booked for root touch up this time I was not aware that would be assigned to any male there should be option available for the preference for experts required
gud job
Charges are way too expensive....wasted my money buying a subscription.... won't do it again
Great interface...my go to app
The time ago the services were held but now the services aren't being booked not only mine this was the same complaint from my relatives and friends
Worst company no customer support. They accept bookings and send no one. Happend multiple times. Stay away from urban company and save your time.
Best UI/UX. Best customer experience overall.
No customer care details. Trying to contact since last one week, but feeling helpless now. Pathetic. Local vendors are better, at least they are accessible
My location is not showing properly
very very good service provided by uc. the beautician was very humble and all of the above the hygiene was very well maintained.
it is pathetic to get services from Urban Clap. they are not able to manage the client and the service provider. They take money from the client for member ship but able to maintain their quality... POOR QUALITY Further to my more experience with UC, they charging the huge amount from the customers and not giving any resolutions after realising the problem during the services.. A service based organisation if not providing good services then it is just waste of time. Nobody should use it.
Don't buy voucher or gift cards from this really not good .They don't have any policy for redeeming amount for gift card if the validation is expired for the credit
Urban clap sale 2021. Change facial with clean up. Cheat in services. No customer care support. Must stop using
Your Split A C servicing is too expensive and I thin you are service provider only for rich people, they have lots of money. üò°üò°üò°üò° Kindly provide you customers care number in India.
Convenient, reliable and gets the job done!
good
very professional services, addresses all my servicing needs
It was a nice experience and good work by the technicians.
Good
Goid service i am impress
Customer support is pathetic when professional is not allocated
It was good till now but their painter actually threatened my family physically we have to raise a police complaint. Safe to say will never use this app again
good
Worst ever customer service the service agents are not at all a trained profesional nor have any professional ethics no proper customer feedback or after service issues were sorted the service provider cancelled the booking and yet in person chose to give the service charged for it and when the problem is arised again he just dodges the complaint and urbancompany doesnt have any review system for this sort of loopholes regardless of the service provider the app fails to take a proper feedback .?
Acid used by cleaning boy was very powerful we can't bare that .so kindly use less smelly cleaner for bathrooms. Kindly tell your boys not to make a hurry burry. Because our review is our own thing and we would like to give it later. Cleaning boy completely confuses us for his 5 star reviews this is not good. Tell them to do their work and don't force us for high star reviews. this happens to us earlier also with urban clap cleaners . Kindly check as competition is high and other apps ready.
Great experience
Highly unprofessional partners. The executives are useless and not helpful at all. Better to call local personals at least they get the work done
Thanks u.c
good
Don't use this app at any cost, they didn't refund my money after two month, and now they don't reply the emails, they are disgusting omg, don't put ur cards there, update been more than 9 months, send emails and everything and they didn't refund the money, big scam, why didn't answer my email till now.
good way to services for safe home insured technicians and well management thanks keep it up...
Grt performance by all of them
Great experience...well trained professionals
Not happy with the service provided by urban company on AC service..our AC is not properly working (not cooling) after there visit..
Third class services lately and dupe, unskilled and suspicious service agents hired these days. Beware !
excellent service
Nice
Excellent Service
Worst customer service, don't relay in them
K Swathi service is excellent l.. very soothing experience... will definitely recommend...
Not professional service
It's very good ..i like uc
It's not assigning professionals
I like most of the service...but recent bathroom cleaning and exhaust cleaning was bit lousy.
Ramji service was excellent
Wonderful experience
Everything ok but technician telling repair cast is morethan what you mention in the sight.
good work team
I am using your services since 1 year..I am very satisfied with services so far provided ..will continue with your services. But before opted for your app service. I really struggle to get services with offline calls and used to call the resources and further follow up but unable to get the repairs ontime and frustrated with quality. Now,I am very happy with your on line services, get relaxed once I schedule the appointment and no need for follow up and no worries about quality...
If you are using outsource call centre make sure your call agents pick up customer's call at a quiet environment. There is so much noise at the background I can hardly hear what's the agent is saying and strangely the call was cut off and no return of call. Not helpful at all even for change of professional. The call agent has my mobile yet she didn't return the call as I waiting for very long for the next agent to pick up. If your app is friendly I don't need a reason to even call.
They never ever come on time.Atleast 45 mins late everytime
nice service
Excellent service
best
Thank urban company
Great app on Time very useful I will recommend everyone
OK
Awesome and safe service provider. I Love UC.
extremely best service.
good work....
great job
Services used: Tv installation, hair cut. Very satisfied with the services so far.
Trust me. If u want to typically be cheated try them... the prices mentioned are just base price always any time any professional comes he explains things which u don't know and make a bill or double or triple... Don't get into this trap I have tried them several times... always the same
Booked s service , done payment but merchant denying that they received it. Shown all proff of my payment , also confurmation from bank that payment successfull still Urban company denying about it. How POOR service.
40 % discount , that's only for eye wash
I give it 1star bcoz uc not serve at my location my locatin is aligarh (up) west
It's a bad culture while onboarding person on board they firstly hide the main things after 1 day they will tell it's a 12 days training which is paid of 6500 rs. and then play with trainee that you are not selected on wasting their 12 days of timing and finally said you are not selected.. kindly stop playing with your new joiners I would like to request the mgmt team that kindly look into this so called training procedure as all time is precious. STOP WASTING NEW JOINERS PRECIOUS..Stop this..
good
Very good
‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§¨‡•ù‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ
Very disappointing service have regisyered for the service for more than 2 days now and no professionals are assigned not expected this... Very very frustrating Would hv given 0 stars
The stains on the floor could not be removed. Better chemical has to be provided
very Good
Urban company having experienced technicians which safeguard our equipment.
nice
I'm satisfied with the service done by UC technician.
Worst experience, Nobody to help or to contact with. They just know how to take money but don't know how to provide the services....Refund is pending and don't know when are they gonna initiate it.... Pathetic experience
Urban Company is doing fantastic service in professional way. I will keep using forever. Thank you UC & Professionals.
great
Very bad experience they are totally unprofessional I loss my 6800/- for my damage AC works even after complains UC didn't reply me
He is very good person and and experienced
Staff member very nice
I had booked for 3 bathroom cleaning and requested that the cleaners bring new scrubs and cloth. I was informed by Urban Company executive that this request cannot be met. As per Urban Company, the tools will be sanitized. I further asked what does sanitized mean and to that the executive said they have only called to tell me that they cant fullfill the request and cannot provide further explanation. I am shocked at the level of rudeness by Urban Company.
Why the fitness instructor option not showing
Very well professional. well expert and amazing work by professionals. highly recommend
The services are expensive. 90% of the technicians donot know any regional language or english other than Hindi. Once they come for service they start suggesting and selling additional services apart from the service that is booked. Their insurance after service is a money robbing policy and we cant claim any of that. Its better to go with local technicians rather than booking through this app. I feel cheated by them and will try not to book through them in future.
No way to contact urban company through call or chat for complaints. When there are offers the therapist is not aware, the timings for the massage are not mentioned correctly in details tab, these are basic things, disappointed with UC
Ok. Good..
They will cancel your appointment after booking. Everytime they will repeat same. Waste of using this app.
Poor Service
The App needs to be a bit more customer friendly vis-a-vis filling customer profiles, location/address, etc. Frequent responses like 'invalid name', address, etc. to customer-filled details make use of the App somewhat problematic. Rejection of professional titles like 'Dr.' before customer names is annoying. Otherwise, the services provided are very good.
Excellent service
good
Quite good
excellent service
Thank you Urban Company. I am very satisfied with the services provided by your partners at reasonable price. Keep up the good work!
They provide awesome service. They have well attitude professional employees to provide great service. My review is based in two excellent services done for me
You book for some crucial help. And wait for two three days only to get rescheduled again. When you take customer's need for granted, you can't provide a good service either. The help from UC side is great and money got refunded within 15 minutes. But the professionals working with UC should think about customers.
‚ù§Ô∏è
This was my first time opting for haircut service from Urban company. The hairstylist has done a pathetic job and when I raised this issue with the company they said they are gonna send the same professional to fix my hair! The other option being they would credit 300Rs and then I need to pay another 200Rs and book a different hairstylist to get my hair fixed! Since I didn't agree on the above they had arranged a call with the hairstylist who happens to claim that I have cut the hair by myself!!
No professional Assigned - Well my previous comment is removed let's see if they keep this one. I get a call after logging several call back request and from the agents network is so bad you can't even hear what she is saying. Hope they had better support services
No customer care number
This app is very useful for essential needs.. thank you
Nice service of men's salon..
Too expensive service provided by urban company
Too too much expensive AC Service
good technican
I would not even give one star. Worst company ever. Not at all trust worthy. They did not assign a professional. Neither they have a customer support nor chat bot. They jus take your money and dont respond.
Good

Who is handling operations at Nashik..?
UC PROMISE OF CASHBACK RS 200 WHILE PAYING THROUGH AMAZON PAY BUT NO CASHBACK
Kitchen chimney deep clean is a scam
Highly professional staff with on time completion of work. With value for your money services.
Service is ok but price are extra orbiantant.
5 years And buity parlar
Professional cancelled the service and cheated with money and customer support only apologizing not taking the action to resolve the issue. Worst experience ever. I want compensation for my inconvenience caused for their executive's fault. But they are only saying sorry. Bad app and bad working professionals.
Excellent serviceü•≥üíï, totally loving it‚ù§Ô∏è
Very very bad experience
charging a high amount for normal issues
Excellent !
Urban Clap is simply amazing.. There service too good and it's affordable.. A real helping hand for our home.. Thank you Urban Clapüëåüëåüëç
Good app
I have Satisfied with the urban company services.
one company many solutions good work
1.Technical issues with Payments 2.we want you to add a feature for cleaning windows, fans etc every quarterly or for every 6 months
Booked carpenter twice no professional assigned
My experience in this company's service is very worst, I took the bathroom cleaning services for the very first time and their cleaner did not clean anything and wasted the time by scratching the tiles and commod with iron plate only and did not used any chemical on it by saying that the company did not provide enough of any chemicals, he did not touch the tap, mixture, side walls and even the floor it is still dirty. He even did not clean the window or anything else like gyser etc...
excellent service
UC has made our life easier. No fuss, just get the work done. However, it'll be great if they allow multiple kind of bookings at once. Like adding services to a cart and then checking out at once. The order can be split in the backend. It'll make UX better.
No commitment regarding professional assignment. Time management issues. Even after expected time no professional gets assigned and there is absolutely no way to contact their team.
super service everytime
ur the best all my problems solved in one app
Yesterday the professional wanted me to reschedule and today after the professional asking me to prepone the time,,I came early from office to see that my appointment had been cancelled. Why can't UC inform me about cancellation?
service was so extlent that we want to give 10 stars to the service provider Mr.Meghraj.
Good experience. But needs improvement. Technicians have a lot of restriction on the type of work they will do. Also, recently the massage services have gotten very expensive.
My experience with urban company has been good. Just want to suggest only one thing in their facial services please start mentioning which facial is good for oily skin, dry skin so on. This will help the customer in getting more better service. Otherwise it's good.
excellent job
Professional cud not complete but walked away with 5.5k n ignores my calls now The company offers me 200 Rs to compensate All I asked was for him to wash the filter n re check the machine but the professional advised me to clean it myself n check it myself I regret approaching them Shouldn't hv paid the professional Big mistake
We thought stylish will come and cut out hair but he said we only cut small hair of small kids
saikumar service very good I'm happy
I am highly satisfied with Supinder pal singh for solving my problem via video conference today on 10/08/21 at about 2.50 pm
Urbanclap best service
The charges too high for cleaning of mattresses. It just 10-15 min job as the couldn't manage underside of Mattresses due to heaviness. Therefore job is not fully done. The charges should be reduced based on time consumed
Horrible work with no accountability from urban clap after taking money upfront
I have subscribtion in Urban clap. Everything is good but main problem is female beautician are behind ratings. Before starting work they just demand give rating give rating. Atleast finish your work let us give some time. I don't have choice otherwise I will not call urban clap service.
I am giving 4 stars because there is no hair cut option for women in the Women's salon section. It would be good if there is haircut option too
I had taken Urban clap services for my washing machine, the technician was efficient and quick in completing the jobüëç
Worst customer service nobody turned up for service they simply wasted my time though I had to pay in advance they don't value customers time and money....
worst policy
Can't add my card details for payment .
Excellent job
They will always try to convince the client to reschedule or cancel the appointment instead of making the employee of UC to go and do the service. Bad policy
good experience
Hidden charges for just changing a pipe in ac, fraud
I had booked a salon package for my mother for 8.30. There were no professional for that time slot. The executive called to reschedule at other time for which i confirmed 9.30 will be ok. A professional named Deepa Dominic Dsilva got assigned and without any intimation she cancelled the service and now new bookings are not available. For rescheduling the booking for today i am not getting any discount if done by the customer executive. And no slots for today if i check in the app. Fakediscount
good
nice
No more good especially customer service.
Worst app I ever seen, becarefull I have booked one sofa cleaning, but wrongly I given incorrect address. There is no way to change address , only way is to cancel booking by paying 150 rs extra charges. Well I have booked same service again, this time these people cancelled my booking without any intimation. I never see this type of pathetic service in any app. Never ever pay advance to these people.
Urban company is a scam, use this app at your own risk. I purchased an annual RO plan with three servicing but the technician cancelled on the same day citing lack of parts. UC refuses to refund the full amount, despite being unable to fulfil the servicing. Zero customer service and a complete lack of any ethics. Go to your local servicemen, they'll be more honest than this pathetic company.
This application developers only developed this app for money indian can't created excellent things all items margin money cut by workers I'm not a Urban Company Worker but this thing not good development your rules or do Better...
I have A.C service.The rating is zero...
Beyond expectations. Loved the service provided by Arjun Raut. It was within TAT
Good
Service was okay until you try to claim warranties for the more expensive items. Then they will suddenly stick to the limited 90 day period, etc. etc. I've never felt so cheated. They will try to drag the customer in between issues concerning the company and their professionals. I will have to rethink about opting for their services in the future.
are robbing
I'm greatly satisfied by the services that Urban Company provides. It's doing a great job in terms of managing its clients and the services required. I have availed multiple services for salon, massage and home cleaning and I have had no complaints. However, it was quite disheartening to see how it doesn't provide any vehicular services to its partners. Salon and massage services for women are provided by lady partners who have to carry extremely heavy salon equipment bags and massage beds.
good company üëç
Urban Help
superb facility and fantastic service

Froud company
Excellent service
Poor service. App is not working as per our expectation. No service provided on timeline
Fraud staff...not professional and don't know their work
Pathetic service. Got my AC uninstalled and installed by urban clap . Before uninstallation my AC was in perfect condition . And now the gas has been reduced and the support team says they are not responsible for this . And hilariously they give 90 days warranty period which is of no use
good service
It was my first experience and and after reading negative review I was a bit confused but I decided to take the service and I'm really impressed with the service provided. Btw I had ordered service for chimney cleaning
During cleaning my AC your technical broken clip of body and not intimate me or company.
Your representative was so rude.
Worst experience !! They keep on rescheduling your appointment on 11th hour and misguide you for wrong slots and then will show their safety concern!
I have a concern...Plz can you make separate teams according to the type of work...At least one separate and dedicated team must be available for bathroom and toilet cleaning activities...The same team should not be assigned the kitchen or gas stove cleaning or other activities..I am sorry to say this .... Thank you.
Urban Company truly is a life saver. Excellent services.
I know you can't change your name from 'Urban Company' to 'Robber Company' for obvious reasons, but your deeds are just to literally rob your customers. No matter how much accessories and fittings I provide to technician, the technician will always rip you off by hundreds to thousands using a loop hole. Plumber asked me for hundreds of rupees to just fasten a single bolt and that's shocking as it gets. Talking about reviews, they're all paid fake reviews in app stores as well as inside the app.
No option to call and make a complaint.....fraud company
I had the worst experience with this company. You get assigned professionals, which you cannot choose. They came to my house to do deep cleaning. They didn't do the cleaning properly (in fact they claimed to have cleaned things such as fans and windows that they didn't even touch). Then they damanged the kitchen wall and stained the house floor with acid. Urban company is doing nothing about this. Use this app and their shady services at your own risk!!!
Excellent
Fake company in the name of professional services. They are nothing more than an outsourcing company who are outsourcing street workers only in the name of their brand. Be aware before taking any so called professional services from them.
Poor Service, unprofessional staff & customer resolution team - Unprofessional massageTherapists constantly keep canceling the service requests as well as discount coupons and UC credits. 3 days and the booking is still not confirmed and now handed over to a fresher, despite constant requests. Going forward won't be using any services from UC nor recommending to anyone else.
Good user friendly app and courteous staff
Good work
They do not valye ur time or patience... the technician was suppose to come at 9 and no one even called or came... they were suppose to call me in 60 mins and no1 called... useless services n useless app
This is a 0 star. They over charged me and the work is not done properly. Customer support is non existent here. Please use local hire.
Good service initially it was not so good but over time they become really good i am using them for a few years now. They are my first choice over local vendors. At times even my socity electrician are not able to do as Great a job as urban clap folks. Plus generally these chaps don't cheat
Worst experience..UC don't deserve any star but without star, review will not be posted so I am giving one ..No technician came till 8 PM despite rescheduling the booking twice . Then another shamful act on the part of UC that entire money also not refunded though it assured by the executive. I suggest all please be extra careful while booking services from UC and dont pay any amount in advance .They are basically playing Fraud with innocent customers Anand
you guys are awesome
Excellent services!!
Getting things done is now easier, thanks to UC. I really like how you handle complaints and feedbacks.
Company is doing a good job of orgnising the unorganised personal services.
Very expensive for cost ac insulation have bad experience
This is good app
Good service
Hi, As a company, please have a little responsibility on the following. 1. Assign the professional on time based time scheduled. 2. Ensure your professional is vaccinated during this pandemic. This is unnecessary risking your professional as well as customer. Inspite of several requests, this is not fulfilled. Hence I am forced to cancel my booking. Very pathetic.
Booked cleaning of 3 bathrooms for 7th August through my son's account. The person who came shut himself up in the bathrooms for around 40 minutes each. Didn't clean the tiles, commode and mirror in one bathroom nor the doors and hooks in any bathroom. Couldn't inspect the bathrooms as the person had not even wiped any of the floors or tiles dry. Waste of time and money. Disgusted with and cheated by this company.
If any one thinking to join this company pls be careful this people will take money from you inthe name of training and after collecting money this people will rejact you be careful it's a big scam fraud company do any thing but don't joint this company check the reviews on Facebook even customers are not satisfied with this uc even there money is also stuck I think ratan tata also got fool by investing in uc this people are telling ratan tata had done financed in uc
Good
Very bad experience from UC reprentative and workers
Good
Poor service...I'm 3 month chasing that my product would be resolved but not yet to resolve...always your serive man busy and not reach my home to re-service & correct my product...bass paise hamesa inko chahiye,kabhi ye kharab kabhi wo kharab...meri AC kharab kar diya
Worst service ,they are not professional and not following their schedule,not recommended
I got hair cut today from so called professional...he asked me or forced me to give rating 5 star rating
hidden charges! and they charge 50 for for the mask which cost 2 rs!!!!
Good service providers...
Worst customer service and worst hair saloon ever i got.
Never trust them, once you book partner will call you 10 times to chance slot.
Very horrible experience with urban clap in waterproofing services. Totally loot of hard earned money of a common man.
Exceptionally good service
Good and professional services by urban company .love this app
Nice service provider co
Excellent service at affordable prices
Beautician was good but wax quality were poor my wife have rashes because of waxing
Very bad experience. When you select certain services and go to cart, this will not appear in your cart summary with whole narration.. Embarrassment with professional when they come to work.
Very Good Experience with the partner doing service. Thanks to Urban Company
I ordered a service of bathroom cleaning and it was rescheduled by the company but still the person didnot turned up and I didnot get any information regarding the same from the company
Ok super
Poor marketing skills. Gave offer of 250 off on facial and when tried to book, it says slots full and within hrs they expired the coupon. Very very bad marketing tactics. Won't use this fraud app anymore.
Poor customer services. Does not even respond to emails
Amazing experience with Urban. Job well done.
If you are not willing to give service then why are you giving discount codes and then not accepting my order waste of time
A simple thing like mentioning home address is not there in the app.
Scheduled a bathroom intense cleaning, but the cleaner Aakash Wankhede didn't show up. I got no intimation from him or their customer service for 3 hours, finally when they did they couldn't arrange the service for me on the same day and rescheduled for the next day. Very unprofessional considering they get paid upfront and their is no COD. Their customer service agent tried to pacify me with a high rated cleaner saying that he will do better than the last one.
Good Service..
While the app is good for the most parts I expect a better navigation to be integrated so as to help partners as well as save customers time. Another TIP . Tipping services should be allowed after a service is provided. It's common sense that I would tip a partner after their service. How am I supposed to know how they will perform when i am booking the service? Otherwise just call it Donation.
I have been waiting for a callback since 4 days to discuss an unsatisfactory service by their professional.
Good Work by Joad Ali, cleaning done for Chimney and Bathroom
Best service app
If the service is not available pls let us know before booking only. We took time to select the item it's showing ever thing at the time of checkout.
Super
Very bad
-pathetic services, -service providers do not turn up and keep on calling asking to reschedule -when services are bad and I give the appropriate ratings, the service providers hound you on whatsapp asking to change their ratings -slots are shown as unavailable even when you are trying to book 2 days in advance
Completely unprofessional service .
Kitchen Cleaning is not good.. Do not use kitchen cleaning service of Urban Clap. They promise all kitchen cleaning in service description, but the service done is not even the half of what they promised. Very disappointed with the service. üò†üò†üò† did not accept this from Urban clap... üò°üò°üò° Even the customer care service is not good.. They tell u to mail the problem and then nothing after that.
Perfect job
I was not even informed via call about the rescheduling of my booking. I was not even taken the concent prior to slot booking. What kind of hell of service you guys are providing. Is there any person ready to take the responsibility for this. The service professional came upto my building and said she is coming upstairs. And then she went back and my booking got rescheduled. Do you guys even have SLA??
Bathroom cleaning is not good. Waist of money.
Rescheduled the booking at their convenience. That too at a time when it is not possible to avail the service. A big thumbs down. Do not trust them.
Great üëç
excellent service
Services was denied by professional and promised by customer service to refund my money still didn't get.
Unable to connect to customer care in case of urgent need post service being taken
Very bad service provided by the staffs of the urban company. They should hire trained staffs,almost all are untrained, they are makeup artists but don't know the basic also. Highly dissatisfied
Android App download is getting stuck at 83%. Tried 2 phones.. Very strange nobody checked this from your team themselves..
Good services but for some services safety fee is too high, I mean 100 as safety fee for calling a carpenter is not that high? Charges for actual work is separately charged.
Good
Nice company üòäüòäüòäüòäüòä
Good service
Not working at all can't book any appointments
Prompt and dedicated service.
Reducing to 3 *. App has become extremely slow especially ovet weekends. Few instances where i paid upfront for a service, after service the provider charged more. Due to service rates changing between whats shown to us and what is shown to provider. Really disappointed with the experience.
Got a hair cut done by Mr Amar. Very professional and excellent service.:)
Good and superb service üëç
Terrible experience with Urban Company. I used Urban Company for painting my flat. They promised to complete in 10 days. Now it's more then 4 months and still left with pending work. Worst part is, they took money before start of the work. No customer care number to directly contact them. There is option of raising complain from their app but it's on their mercy to call back. I am raising complain on daily basis but no one bother to call back.
Though the professional visit was satisfactory but work not yet started even after payment of the booking amount. Now work estimate being re-verified which is not expected from a professional company.
I have book an appointment for my child by around 11 for 12:30 and still no professional assign taking to much time first appointment and very disappointed and customer care call me up said sir we cas reschedule your appointment for tomorrow if you have time.
Your to go to app for just about anything you want well serviced.
Good service
Very professional handling of services. And extremely helpful in covid times
UC guarantee is useless, they don't provide such services and put all the blame on customer if you asked for revisit.
excellent service...
Good

exi jobs
I have requested a service yesterday amount is deducted from my account and services not booked I have requested for refund but In app m unable to find any options
Well i called their exterminator because there were termites in my new home,long story short they stole my apple airpods(worth 12000) and when complained, the customer care just denied it,not even tried to help me.
Spoiled my AC machine and your team is reckless to respond.
Thank you for good service and behaviour of service boy
Worst customer care. They allocated a hair stylist for 10.00 am, he didnt turn up after 10.15. I tried calling him and he cut my call. I tried rescheduling it for 11 choosing the option 'i didnt like the professional'. They allocated me the same guy thrice. Then i cancelled the order. Then one super cranky woman called me from their customer care. You know what, dont put this kind of peo0le in your customer care. I was using your app for a year regularly and this is how you handle yur customers?
If you want to talk to any customer rep, there is no option available.
Really not worth. Always charging highest amount. Per drill charges of around‚Çπ70. Better we will ask our nearby vendor instead of contacting this money minded Urban Company.
Very unprofessional working. From early morning before 7am the person had been calling for confirmation. And after all this too he very conviniently rescheduled the service timings at the very last minute. Infact after the time in which he was assigned to start the process. And after all these trouble customer has no way to reach ppl to resolve the issue. Just text and wait for ur next. What silent torture. For all wrongs the customer should suffer silently.Also this was 2nd time rescheduled
This urban clap is only for metro area like Mumbai or delhi but some other areas in South is not available it's waste of time.
I booked using gift card received. My booing is scheduled at 11 and now I dont see any booking while giftcard is redeemed. Not happening. Facing issue past 3 times
Ive been using Urban Company (Clap) for a few years and this is what I've observed: the professionals/technicians are largely good: they know their job, are courteous, are on time and do a good job. It's been a generally bad experience with the cleaning crew: they do not do a good job (some don't 'know' the job!) with the excuse usually being 'yeh nahi hoga', and do not respect the booking timings. It's like one is paying for a shabby, messy job. The bad experiences linger.
Nice
Pleasent
None of the so called Urban Company experts honour the appointment. I have tried multiple services and no one has ever come on time. They arrive couple of hours late or they just ask you to cancel the service. Very unprofessional!
Was good for few bookings, but then professional are not assigned even after rescheduling by UC multiple times.
Horrible service...they cancelled the booking 1hr before and was not able to assign another person...
No customer support whatsoever
The customer care service is pathetic in urban company.... it's really rubbish. They only talk talk and talk. Never resolve our issues. They only keep our phones on hold. Connect to senior executives etc... no proper customer care service.... the app is on and offf... it works occasionally wen it feels gud. Highly disappointed üòû
Urban comp is actually a fraud company.I had ordered for Water Purifier repair , the technician came and he said all parts need to be changed and billed 4000 Rs..Later the same technician called and said it can repair it for Rs 2500. I refused and called local technician who repaired it for Rs 500. Urban company has hired looters and then loot is shared between Urban company and technician..They will always bill very high amount I regret taking 6month membership..
Poor services
Awesome service and on time.
Iam ac technician my mony 2 years back iwell paid service Jet pump not delivered iam complint catagory manager infrom no response vvvvvvv bad customer side not delivered service so my profil blocked
Not a great app experience as can't book more than 2 services in the same booking/checkout, need to improve this in your flow. As a customer, I may want to opt more cleaning services. Full home cleaning doesn't include fridge or other appliances cleaning and app doesn't allow to club them as well.
Worst service ever.. I am using this app since 4 years now but never came across such scenario. After honey wax the very next day I got heat boils & rashes all over my hand , I raise complaint but I didn't receive any proper resolution for it waiting for them to respond to me .. this is highly disappointing because I was thier valuable customer since 4 years and this is what they have to offer Really Really Disappointed
Even after my referral has taken a service I have not received rewards.
Very good
Very bad cleaning service they give 3 part service which customer unable to awer of difference of cleaning ..price too low professional are unsatisfied with money and some time customers also arguing with professional when it comes to monthly and deep cleaning price difference...this is the main reason for downfall of the company..
Not taking current location
Job done nicely, appreciate the good work.
Good Professionals..!!
üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
The app is very nice they give some packs and i choosed one first time and it gone nicely now my headache is gone so smooth and very nice than expected they never forget thier things at my home and did everything excellent so plz download this app and it has More added things than a simple parlour they cleaned what they messed up service is very nice thanks urban clap i will repeat give oreder next month üòä
I took waterproofing and painting services. Now the paint is peeling off within 4 months and water seepage is not resolved. They close complaints on app without doing anything. I have already reopened the case 3 times now and it just shows agent assigned and then it gets closed just like that. Is there an escaltion or helpdesk. Urban Fraud!!
Very Bad service charges high and duplicate replacable product.....
Very much satisfied with their work,will definitely recommend to all.
Nice and comfortable
No emergency calling number. 4 hours after AC repair, internal wiring of AC caught fire and there is no way to find help from Urban Company
Awesome experience
Superbbbbü•∞üòòüòò
I WOULD LIKE THAT SOMEONE SHD CALL ME OR SEND ME CONTACT FOR AC WORK
Great service, got my bathrooms cleaned. An excellent job done! Keep it up!
Good professional beauticians
Great app, just get better contractors, shining white has been disappointing lately
Very bad
I booked my slot for haircut from my friend's account and the agent called and rescheduled. I had to pay twice.
Over pricing. Urbanclab should introspect accessories prices. Should not cheat. I can not refer for anyone for rewards becuase this app not at all deserves. I suggest customers jigyadi
Really Dissappointed with the experience. This is the 2nd time, you people have asked me to cancel the booking. If you do not have any professionals then why do you advertise so much also why do you avail the slots.
‡§ä‡§ä‡§ä‡§ä‡•Ç
Good overall experience, I get the service within 2 hours of demand. Really impressed with the speed and ease of use.
There is no respect for a client's time and money.
App is verygood
Experienced professionals and quality service. Availed the Saloon and Pest control service with UC, overall satisfactory.
Good
Good
Great app and great services
Service is very good and timely work.
It Is Very Useful For Everyone.A Complete Solution For Household Repair Needs.
Reviews of vendors on their site/app are certainly manipulated. Don't fall for 4.8 and 5 ratings. Better rely on official service centers.
Poor service. Paid 1900Rs, bookings cancelled by service provider, I got refund of 1537rs=only.
Professionalism is another name for Urban Company.
Very worst app
Sir need your help your carpenter rajjev Sharma visited at my place give me the quotation and the list saying he will come but not yet come Please send some other carpenter it's urgent work
Just a suggestion, pls provide the temperature gun for ur partners to check the customer's temperature for the safety of the partners. Everybody safety is the priority now.
Very Good
Highly recommended for instant services.
These type of companies are not customer friendly and professional , if services goes wrong, there is no accountability. There is no way customer can reach them. They call at their own wish and disconnect the call, even no accountability to rectify mistake although admitted in my case that hair stylist was not aware of hair cut but still didn't show the courtesy to send another hair stylist to check what went wrong. Customer care is pathetic. . Hair stylist are more pathetic
Very pathetic user experience, I bought premium membership as they were showing service availability in my area but they always show no workman available. Cheater app
Great
Pathetic service from yesterday i am not been assigned with any professional,and i was told to reschedule at todays morning but still no updates. Ridiculous service .
The professional didn't quote the price before starting the service. I was supposed to pay ‚Çπ250. He just cleaned the AC vent in 2-3 minutes and asked for ‚Çπ1200. Customer support wasn't helpful in any regard.
Pathetic service from UrbanCompany. No ownership of service done by UC. Took a paint service from UC..the painters were efficient but paint started to peel off after few months. UrbanCompany clearly stated they will not do the patchup work even though the painting service included the warranty. I regret getting the paint job done by UC. Instead I would have hired the same painters offline and got the job done for much lesser price and will have them taking the ownership of it too.
They change regularcleaner or no show up for no notice. Ironing done with some cleaners was terrible u have to call and complain every single cleaning which is full time job.save ur nurve and change the company
Excellent cleaning service provided. Thank you
I've booked technician For deep cleaning of 6 AC and he came start with one and then left claiming somebody else wil come but no body came nor called.
Excellent, worth money
Very satisfactory experience in different activities we utilised
I'm always satisfied with all type of services .
Stop sending me sms. Your home cleaning service tht i took in feb 2021 was very bad so dont expect anymore from me.
Scammers , the urban technician told me it will cost 3500 for repair but it cost me 700 when done by local technician. Cheaters looting money.
Good
The company is cheater. I'd got my AC repaired and it again developed problem. Now the technician as well as the company is not responding. Complaint raised on twitter too. But they are not bothered. Don't get anything repaired from them. It's better to approach the nearest local repairer. At least you can catch hold them.
Very bad service
Urban company is good company for services.
Very bad,so unprofessional
App is fine but customer service CHAT does not exist if you ran into issues or even to ask general questions. Also they dont tell about revisit charges in the app when attending to the same problem when job request was made in the app. Please make a note of it.
Excellent
The services is urban co. is so good. There team members are professional and they were move in a friendly way with the customers. Urban is giving services in all fields. Hence there is no need to worry. There charges r reasonable. But they have to show some benefits to regular customers.
Super app
Always good
Good service in this app
Frequent payment fail.. for each refund take 5 business days...
Worst. I booked sofa cleaning service. I cancelled it. Got message from UC service successfully completed they didn't even refund 1500... fraud n cheat company...
Not able to book at all...worst is no direct contact info for the company given
Company kha liya Apne Piche ka sakti hai
Waste app We cant change our profile basic details also, which we have entered by mistakely
The worst service I have ever seen for painting a home. We need to pay money upfront but after that real torture begins, no one is available to support and if you got the problem with service or you got any incorrect color also no one is available to support. And they will reschedule your service without informing to us They are really horrible and high cost please don't fall into the scam please contact your near by painter to get the quote there is nothing special in urban company aftr payment
This application is not working even after multiple time installation and uninstallation. Application is neither taking login nor displaying anything without login. Pls help
Very poor company
So good
Price for fitting 3 glass shelves costed 600r.. very expensive...
Baad campani
Very pathetic experience as hired beautician is not perfect as well
Sudarshan had done cleaning with extreme dedication providing utmost satisfaction to me. His sincerity and discipline in work is highly appreciated. Thanks to Urban Company for rendering such an excellent service.
good service
Bhut Ganda services h
Services offered by the concerned are upto the mark and timely
Good service given
Canceled my booking before two weeks, anf I can still see it, when I cancel it again they charged me for the cancelation
Excellent service by urban clap üëè
Waste app
Good app
Bakwas
Very much disappointed for there salon services. They automatically rescheduled service date and time without informing the customers .Didn't give the promised service yet.Too bad experiences.
Trainees have spoilt the reputation. Very highly disappointed. Perhaps ..will not return and advice others too. Stuck up from 12 till 6.30 pm and the job is still it done. Shame.
App is good but there are communication gap between the customer and visiting technician.
Makes home service booking easier and with current Home Rush offers and Deal of the days, the service has become affordable unlike earlier.
I have called for air condition repair, two of them came and they were so professional and wonderful. I am very happy with the serviceüòä
Cancelled one booking without any prior notification and another one's been pending forever
No dam way to talk to customer care... Line in the world of illution
excellent job done
Very bad rather worst
I would strongly recommend NOT TO USE this app it's of no use never received the service
pathetic service, no customer satisfaction, even after contacting them no resolution until yet..there is no option to even call f om your side
Everyone did very good job. Excellent, we are happy with the service.
Awesome service . loved the way Urban Clap works .
Very bad experience. My problem has not solved yet. So many times send messages regarding my issue but no response from your end.
Urbanclap Professionals in Hyderabad are not coming on time they are asking to either reschedule or cancel
inprove the app
Proper customer service and query platform within the app will be beneficial. Just FAQs don't help.
Good and quick experience
This is a very good one because whenever I called for this service, whatever service I have to call some help center here , everything Done gets instantly.
Very polite service executive
Very bad service
Pathetic experience from team, their technicians disappers after servicing. Non existent customer support. Their warranty service and insurance claims are all scam. I would have given negative rating if it was available.
Good
I have a chronic illness and have been denied service by their partners on multiple occasions which honestly makes me feel terrible and is SO against their discrimination policy :/
Professional not assigned. Unreliable
Good
Fooling around people.....service charge for AC is 698 rupees and the for gas it's 2500 rupees ( I don't get any bill from anyone).... pretty much fraud....the gas charge is not maintained anywhere in the app.. previously I booked service from outside it costs 1700 in total....... The service personnel is good and professional...great work.... company is not flexible either...
Only flashy from outside.Warranties are just myth.customers are left on technicians who never agree any repair back during warranties.UC doesn't even have a dedicated support line for customers
Superb app ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä , Give us More offers
1st time experience with hairstylist Arman was great. But the app was causing problem due to which my time was wasted.
Professional cleaning
Fraud company
Fraud company, no customer service at all.
Nice app and well addressed for all basic services
Not only the services, The app UI is very user friendly. Excellent.
Excellent service
This app is pathetic because i applied for ac service a week back but they are rescheduling the time againand again and not coming at my home this app is worse pathetic appüò°üò°
very useful and highly trained service people.
Very good services
Very good quality services.
They spoiled my bathroom tiles.. I.dont prefer bathroom cleaning service from them
booked for hair cut one day prior but salon guy didn't come and not answering my phone neither urban company support responds. Very poor service
App is good but technician are cheating the customer by giving over quotation its 3 time higher and showing unnecessary work .UC quoted 4500rs and i done the work in 1400rs see the difference and quantity of work is also High
not able to use any of the Aug 15 offer season!
Bad experience with urban clap service ,I have taken AC service related water dripping after service issue still same and service engineer ask more money to resolve same issue by dismantling whole ac.
My mark down is for the support staff not for service team. Am quite upset with the support. Though the service is good sometimes, you need to book the services at your own risk. There is no grievance team to fix any goofup from customer care. I booked bathroom deep cleaning and the person didn't showup. I hardly received any support from UC. This happened almost every time i book services. I lost hope and i lost my membership too. I feel local guys are more responsible than UC.
After selecting everything if I am proceeding to book, nothing is happening on clicking several times to book.. You do not wish me to book for your services? Please fix this problem asap!
If you really need service. Pls don't use this app
water lickage issue is still not resolve
Unprofessional Service. No complain option available in app. No option to change the technician.
Payment debited but no technician visited and there after not getting any update from urban company how to get Payment return
I want to change professional in my profile
very nice service n treatment
Services was good
Good
Can u plz make ur app a lil more user friendly...??
Pathetic n unprofessional. They reschedule my appointment without my concern.. Unprofessional
VERY BAD
Very Nice...
great
Excellent service
I have booked bathroom cleaning service. Professionals dint clean properly and only bother about reviews and money. I tried to contact UC customer care. But of no use. Worst app and service.
I booked a professional for the service of my AC. The service was done so badly that the AC started leaking water right after around 40 days of the service. I had to call another technician from nearby service center. The professional from the urban company didn't clean the AC from inside, he just cleaned the output and the filter of the AC. He didnt even bother to clean the drain pipe because of which it clogged. I raised a ticket but it was of no use because the issue happened after 30 days.
The apps doesn't allow me to change date and frequency. It keeps crashing. Please rectify.
very professional people
Unprofessional workers. Cancelled the booking like Ola cabs.
Amazing service
No service center to call and clarify our doubts
Had a very bad experience and When I sent the feedback. then I received a call from their but they disconnected my call in a middle of conversation .
Poor service from customer service. Don't go for high amount services. Could have given 0 rating is there is option
Service has degraded drastically. 1. Parts that are replaced do not last more than a month. 2. Technician are irresponsible, do not maintain timeslots. 3. Customer call back only to listen issue and not to ACT to rectify them. 4. No follow-up or call back, even they are ignorant to escalate the call.
Very good service provided by uc
Don't book spa services from urban clap. The massage therapist lie, cancel, reschedule and the urban company has no say in it. They are unprofessional. Not recommended! Therapist asked to reschedule for the second time and I had to cancel. This happened after the support team confirmed that "they'll make sure that massage therapist is there on time." Such a shame.
Great
Urban ke sath Mera Anubhav bahut hi kharab Raha main beautician ko book kiya tha aur aur Achanak mujhe phone kar to bolati hai mujhe fever ho gaya hai aur vah bhi nahin aur customer care ka koi support nahin mila ise ghatiya hai kuchh bhi nahin Sakta mera 2 din khrb hua
No service for hair cut availablity since 2weeks no help line number plus the email id help service is fake. UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOUR.
No option to contact customer care. No one cares to respond to the queries. Very poor customer service
Need to improve hygiene Need to be particular about safety in these covid time
good service
Very nice
Worst service, I had booked for cleaning services at 11am. Professional does not turn up, then he calls me and asks me to reschedule it . I am a working woman, I stayed back late at home just to get these services done. I wanted to call urban clap helpine number, to help me allot someone else immediately. But there's no much number or a chat room to discuss the issue. Not reliable,it's wrong for not valuing your customers time.
Better
Worst service when question of free warranty comes. I have already wrote earlier that no one is responding my calls. I receive message that you will call back but I am never called back. My ac stopped cooling after your company service but it seems that company is escaping from free visit within warranty period. Whole world gets my number connected except urban company, is it not surprising?
Hi I want to book a floor deep cleaning.. Have a doubt regarding this. Is it includes deep cleaning of windows or not.. There is no customer care support...
Such a irresponsible and rudely behavior by engineer send by them. Poor services and not any option to contact urban clap. After making payment.
Good
I don't understand what's happening in the app.. Currently there is discount on icici cards and net banking and the final price is along with the discount but when you generate otp the final amount is displayed without discount... And with the net banking it keeps failing.. Not even able to contact customer care for any kind of help...
They hired thieves. Stole original parts and replace with duplicate parts. Urban clap do not give original parts to them. It give them freedom to buy local/second hand parts and urban clap charge for original parts. Dont call these thieves.
Had booked for car wash...I have made the complete payment for the service but They have rescheduled the time three times that is itsbbeing delayed for two days from the date of booking very worst response from help line...it's urbancap fault for the delay but they act as if it was customer fault for choosing the time slot for service...today its 4th day and still they are yet to find the professional to do there job..helpline give miss call and send messag coudnt reach you will cal back
Not good for AC services
satisfied with the service
It was the worst service I got from urban company for the painting job. I made so many calls and spoke to them numerous time just to ask them to come and review the job that was done by the painter. They promised twice to send somebody but they dint after all. I asked them for a refund and they said it's not in the policy. I paid nearly 29k, and it seems the work was done by a learner. Waiting for a month for them to rectify, which dint happen, I had put wall sticker to cover their mistake.
I wish I could give thm zero star I suggest everyone please do not download or book any appointment. First they will cost you huge and if something happens again to ur AC or nything for which we hv already paid thn their technician wouldn't answer your call and their representatives they are as lazy and horrible like their company!
Downloaded this app for the first time to try as I was promised ‚Çπ100 in referral but got nothing after creating new ID. No customer service in the app, dissappointing. Going to delete without trying

From this march 2021 three proffesionals has visited to fix low AC cooling but none has been able to resove the issue ...hope UC gets a person who knows how to fix the issue..pls raise your standards ..else stop advt about your company.
When I write my phone number It shows invalid number üò∂üò∂üòêüòê But service is perfect
Worst worst experience of waxing ever. Service was pathetic. As the person was so unprofessional.. She doesn't even know how to do it properly.. After telling like thousand times.. Still there wr hairs on my body.. Disappointed!!
Cost is too much compare to locally available workers. We have to pay so many extra charges.
Great service
Very helpful for disabled persons. God bless URBAN COMPANY üôå
Excellent services.. No need of words.. Just experience it once..
Don't hire anyone from Urbanclap. I have been stuck in painting work for 15 days and they haven't completed even half work. They give false promises. And u get stuck by paying them whole amount in advance. They say something else at the time of booking and then they ask whole amount the first day so you don't have any control over work and the quality. Workers are rude and unprofessional.
Not giving enough information about work
This was the first time i booked an online service from UC and the beautican called me up said she had fever so she wont be able to come request you to cancel the booking i denied to do that very unprofessional
Very bad service by urban company expert's My Air conditioner gas leaking problem not solved even after many urban company expert's checked air conditioner again and again. Wastage of money
There's no cancellation option available in my RO service booking. I want to cancel the booking for Friday as I have to go outstation. I am not able to find the customer care phone number or email id.
Highly disappointed. No professional assigned after multiple follow up...
Unable to contact the company
I got my skin burnt and now even good dermatologist is unable to cure even after 10 days.* strongly recommend friends not to use their services.
Bad experience.(MBS cleaning) .. Am scheduled 3pm they are calling 3.15pm and saying on the way.
Books gyser servicing , worst experience , taking 2 times the charge for changing parts , no proper servicing !!! Will never recommend urban clap to anyone
Very bad experience with this app. Customer can not contact to urban company in case of any problem. Even then company is not refunding money
Urban company is a cheating company I booked a bathroom cleaning service from this app the person came and used too much acid on the bathroom floor and he left, he said I will come back in 1 hour we waited till 4 hours he did not come because of the long kept acid on the floor, my bathroom tiles got bleached and water taps and what ever metal items became rusted, I called so may times to this service center they are not even caring about the damage, all water coming to the walls. Don't trust.
Excellent service
The service doent match with the description all the time. Ordered for full house deep cleaning but they excluded balconies and toilets, when in description of service these are specifically included. Ordered for toilet cleaning and description mentioned that materials are included, where as the servuce provider ask us to getthe material. UC customer care just ask us to talk with service provider directly by connecting us but no proper instructions to comply are being given to service provider.
The app is good but their advertisement shows salon professional s wearing ppe kit, however they just wore masks when we took their services last time some two months back. Today is 4 th August, 2021, I am intensively annoied by the UC service providers, today consequently for third time it happened that assigned professional last momemt cancelled the order. automatically the time gets rescheduled, tele-executive calls to apologize and to inform to take service at their convenience. Pathetic
Recently I bought AC installation Services from UrbanClap, their professional not done his job properly and all gas leaked then I emailed to Urbanclap and asked for Money Back because I paid again due their professional negilance but still not responded.
Great service
Service is good, but expensive, also professionals come late than scheduled time. Worst app and service !!!! Cannot contact their customer care.. they make sure to take money but if any issues with the service.. you cannot call them or chat. So basically you cannot reach them !!!! If you book any service on their app, your precious money and time both are gone !!!!
We can see only good raiting here and I want refer same person for my friends m not able to share like before
Professional service
Service provider do not come on time.. it delays our work as well
Bloody hell experience , worst customer care service ,no value of an individual's money , cost are also very high
It's to much poor service booking hoti hai but banda aata hi nhi aur usko reschedule karte raho bas maine first time use kiya aur first time me hi service bekar ise acha offline me bana lo #$%&%$##$%
Worse ever experienced first time today I booked with UC pathetic first professional assigned was unprofessional were she made me wait for hour and second profressional arrived I don't know why people are giving positive rating but the place were I stay UC is fraud I booked for particular facial they r using some other companies products which is fraudulent with customers and on top of that being their mistake I have to wait for money refund 6 days.. Why you people are torturing customer??????
It was good...
Only money maker campny,
I used The Urban Company after much hesitation, to service my air-conditioning. The people were punctual, polite and worked pariently. However, they damaged the air-conditioner, causing it to leak. What's worse, is the abysmal follow up from The Urban Company. There is no point in making nice advertisements, if you cannot deliver on the promise. I've used them once. Never again. Neither will I recommend them to anyone.
Excellent
Very very poor customer dealing. You are left on the mercy of technician. No support from UC. My issue is pending since one week, no one responding, then automatically cancelled my booking againt warranty.
No reply to concerns especially when we have to repair appliance and no way to track your complains...
Have used several services from Urban Company such as Bathroom cleaning, Hair cuts and they have done an excellent job. Also whenever there is an issue the customer support team quickly involves until it gets resolved. Good Job üëç
Pathetic
Pathetic liars. Technicians hired by them are blood sucking leeches They will deliberately play with parts of your machines to extract money. Bloody extornists. The Gas of my AC leaked out within 3 months of filling.

Very bad experience...will never book again....i have booked the slot 3 times on 3 different dates for hair cut but the professional was not assigned on the scheduled time....in future will never book urban company...very bad experience....i dont want to give even 1 rating ...but i cant give less than one that's why...
After service my ac completly dead...when I raised the issue The technician has taken my ac board and now his number switched off..don't believe urban company..
Very nice service. Reasonable and satisfying.
Nice
Worst company is the best name
Without experience they are sending....they are not a professionals... and I wasted my money....
Very useful services
App is good but should be more freindly and easy to handle.
Worest app , worest company , totally West company üëéüëéüëé
Awesome service at home :-) Loved their work. I had taken cleaning services for sofa, dining table, cusions and carpet. Urban company did amazing job!
The barber who performed my hair cut last time didn't bring the flexible mirror stand to enable to whatch the cutting while performing the haircut.
No transparency at all .. It's better to take local technician service... Not trustworthy.. Totally waste of time and money.... Even the app is a fuzzy... Do not take their service.... I had a call from customer service they said they will call me after few minutes.... It's now more than 4 days still waiting for their call.... Worst service either technician or customer service.... Totally mental torture from their side... Even customer executive are unable to resolve issues.... If there is a.
Good service
Worst service providers left the ac job incomplete
Professional can very boldly deny the service at last moment even if you have emergency. The app does not allow other remedy to get through emergency purpose and also does not reprimand the behaviour of professional.
Good
Excellent
My bathroom tiles ha been damaged by the cleaning professional and no action has been taken despite complaints. Customer support is worst.
urban clap provides most annoying services to the customers.They provide date slot in their app and when we make the booking,they give us call just at the time of appointment mentioned to inform that the executive is not available. They don't value the customer time who cancels all the appointment only for the urban clap booking. This happened many times with me.Above this whoever executive visits for the appointment force us to give them 5-star rating in front of them which is very patheticüò°‚òπÔ∏è
Leaving Urban Clap after using since long time. Now their services are going worst, useless and costly. I had very bad experience, no curthomer care guys will support you, I got a call from a person Imran from urban clap delhi, he didn't listen me only taking favor of his service guy. Seems they are giving more importance to their service man instead customer. Also forcing me to increase low rating of service person as I have given less rating because I was not happy wth his service.
Good
Couldn't get to the point where the service can be availed, the scheduling part itself was gruelling, for instance, I asked a guy assigned task, "Bhaiya aap kahan ho?" To which Ghalib saab took 8 minutes approximately, where in I can sense pakoras cracking in between the job,. Bhai sahab agar bata do toh kya , aapke pakode cheen lunga mein ? by the way, schedule was cancelled, re scheduled and cancelled, this time by myself. Matlab kya hai, aise service ka aur yeh Ghalib ki fauj ka ?
I had a bad experience by urban company They used very bad quality Gelish polish colour.. No body answered my complain I was trying to call them for 2 days no answer üò™ üòï üòí
Prompt service
There is no customer care number for grievance redressal. The 2nd bathroom cleaning offer is not applicable after the first bathroom cleaning order is complete. This is absolutely cheating.
Very Poor Customer service. Support team is incapable of handling complaints
Never sure whether service is guaranteed or not. Booking happens and payment also, but ppl don't show up and they refund. Services are highly non guaranteed
Good
Not satisfactory the app is tricky
The standard and professionalism has decreased now. I tried to contact the assigned person thrice, but he didn't even responded or even bother to inform thar he will be coming. We are paying extra for the service which you have stopped providing now.
Too expensive bt good work
Really had a worst experience with Urban company.I purchased a premium plan for the cleaning. Only 2 people showed up on the scheduled time amd said they'd come back next day. Even the next day, only 3 people came. They splashed water into electric circuits which led to the power outage. Even the cleaning is not done properly. They gave excuses that we can't clean fridge top because it's not covered. It was a total waste of money. I would suggest everyone not to opt for this mediocre service.
Today we got bathroom cleaned by guy assigned by you n he cleaned n took 1146rps n left but y do u send later Messages that we did not respond to calls--its better please give confirmation call routed through UB before they come for job work than asking them to do phone themselves-your sent person came n finished his work n left n then you sent messages
Very Well Service based app. Very Professional. Professionals make up this service based app a very mandatory and important. Extremely well trained Jobs and Services
Pathetic and unprofessional operation. One side will send you offers and on other hand will suspend the account without reason. No one is dying to use the service. Even took their plus membership and then they suspended. Fraud it is!!
good job
Very unprofessional technician ....for electronic gadgets
Professional service , at low cost, and convenient as per our time
Undertook a painting job via urbanclap, they promised safety precautions& what not. None of it was adhered to, technicians walk around your house without any masks.No PPE.the consultant got the colour completely wrong, umpteen no of issues and no call back from urban clap team. I am stuck & they will not resolve this. Warning do not go thru urban clap , there is no direct helpline. You wil have to sort out with the workers who keep messing up.I have dropped a mail to resolve but no response!
Do not believe in the offers ..it's all a scam
I think urban company kitchen cleaning deserve the zero star highly unprofessional staff I call dem for microwave chimney n kitchen cleaning dey charged high n for every step dey are denying I won't do dis while everything was included in package...
Still waiting for Amazon cashback of Rs 200 for one time payment.... Fraud company
Fix the scroll mechanism of the app. Choosing a sub- category in the app is very buggy as it just switches between two pages constantly rather than just sliding to the selected section smoothly.
Urban company is thief. Don't trust upon them. They will take payment in advance and will not give you service
Very good app
The worst company ever
Wonderful app as long as the professional is not shaddy. I hired an electrician who took money from me to buy spare parts and absconded. It's been 2 weeks now and all urbanclap does is letting me know they are escalating this. Not sure how many levels they have to escalate this matter to have my issue resolved but I am prettysure my money is gone.
My urban clap experience was very bad. Both my ACs have issues after servicing. They charge a lot of money for servicing and repair but the quality of work is very poor. I don't recommend UrbanClap for AC servicing/repair. Better to go for local vendors.
Very bad app, Their Professional calls up and tells Urban Clap product is not good will put other companies you pay me seperately. I declined this and told need Urban Clap product only and then he says Urban Clap he won't put and cancelled the product. Then the customer complaint team called back and we're offering services from other professionals and then they mention they don't sell that product only when it's clearly mentioned in the app. They are low in integrity and service
Worst Experience. Never ever go for urban clap painting. First of all the painting had left some patches on my wall and inspite of calling multiple times no response from the company. Its almost a month now. I have paid the money and its all in vain now. Please DO NOT GO FOR URBAN COMPANY.
Great experience with the service üëç
Looting people in name of PPE Kit charges , surge charges etc.
Pathetic service. They charge higher compared to the local professionals and on complaints, they blindly take sides of their servicemen. Especially Mr Adarsh from customer service is very rude to talk and doesn't even listen to your problem. I wish I could give "0" rating to them. They don't even deserve one star
Very unprofessional. Bad service
No way to reach out customer support, waiting from 48 hrs to get a call back on current booking.
To good
There is no way one can reach out to customer care via chat or phone throught the app. One simply cannot. If you have any doubts pertaining to services offerred, they are left unanswered since there is now way to reach out to them.
Due to some reasons I have to cancel one of my booking and Urban-Clap said they will refund my money on 13th July 2021 and till yet I haven't received any amount. There is no support team provided over call nor via Chat. Worst app till now I had ever used. No customer support provided from Urban Clap
I spent almost 9k rupees on my Refrigerator in last 2 years. Two technicians they sent couldn't make fridge running. First technician even tripped my flat power connection. Finally I had to sell my 18K fridge to 2k on olx after spending 9k.
App .. Sloo
Booking not acceptance from after service cash only booking Not accepted booking very waste app my time waste. I will try to 3 days
From the innumerable reviews, mostly 1 star, that speak of unprofessional & bad services- I have totally changed my views about availing several services from UC. Seems to me that this once famed company has gone to the dogs.
Awesome app and awesome services.
If customer has a problem then there is no way one can contact urban clap. Even the professional do not take call regarding the work that they have done. Email is the only option but that is also not taken care of. If they change something which is under warranty, professional do not give warranty card instead they say that the invoice is the warranty card. They do not take call if the item under warranty gives problem. They need to understand the importance of after sale service. Pathetic
Worst service, Every technician claims to not knowing the location. Though had used the services before...pls uninstall this and opt for other provider.
Best service provided by well trained and well behaved professionals.
This 5 star rating is only for UC employee Miss. Vani from social media team.
nice
Prompt and efficient service
best service and on time
All ridiculous service provider set altogether in your company. Your customer support as well as beauty professional all are un professional. Really had a worst experience with you. Please do not promote those products/services which you guys doesn't have. Also hired those people who really wanted to work. Today I booked the service and two professional bluntly asked me to reschedule or cancel it. Finally service is cancelled. Why u guys hire such unprofessional people, Who doesn't wish to work
Urban company is excellent service delivery
Sent unreliable person for service who denied even after payment is done and also took extra charges
Never trust on urbanclap advertisement, ground reality is totally different, i had booked bathroom cleaner service but urbanclap service man denied to clean my bathroom because according to him material of tiles is not sutaible for their any package no classical deep cleaning nor intence deep cleaning. ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§¨‡•ú‡•á ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§® ‡§õ‡•ã‡§ü‡•á‡•§
Good
Fake
Worst customer service.
It was very good!. Excellent work and very clean!.
Very good and supportive
Good App
Pathetic services. Professionals kept on saying we didn't understood how to do this facial. They force customers to reschedule.
I took service recently for my husband, and for me also, professionals are very poor in their work,lastly payment generated by UC was wrong there was mismatch in bill generated and service taken items,we informed to customer care professional but he deny to give solution at present in future it will be considered but not now, still we requested not close the raised complain ticket but after waiting 24hrs also there is no solution,so embarrassing and irritating service from urban clap.
Nice service
perfect
Very bad service
Overpriced Services
Professional Afraid after seeing my kitchen size..he also taken pic.. after giving him 48 hrs for reschedule he calls and telling me that he don't have liquid to clean..can I reschedule again for 24 hrs.. wasting of time.. Professional Name: Yash Dayma..His capacity to clean kitchen like bathroom size
There is a very annoying bug in your app. It keeps notifying me of some appointments that I haven't really booked. When I tap on the phone notification and go inside app, there's nothing -_-
Not sure if they sat there employees and known friends down and rated themselves as 4.5. The service is not even worth 1 star rating. They give a person who is called to be a professional who cannot be contacted how much ever you call. All this is after money deduction. I am disappointed with your customer service.
Your employe is not sure how to work in ac service & solve the problem for the custmer my experions is very very bad after join your company .
Good services provided by professionals.
Worst experience with my painting job They charge money well before but work hasn't started even after 10 days No one responds when we get delayed service, they cover themselves by not providing help center contact number They rate themselves high but their service is very ordinary, not worth our money
There is vast difference between service they committed and actual service. Recently I took AC uninstalltion service. In service they mentioned that all holes will be sealed with POP. However on asking technician bluntly denied and ran away without doing. Also there is no customer support number where we can call and address our issues. It was big mistake to trust and availing service.
Hired for disinfection..urbanclap looted me of my money.. membership fees was not refunded back..this us worst service provider
Very very bad experience with this app this is a fraud they says that they work with the professionals but they are very bad
Has been one of worst experience and after service complaint resolution of the company is the worst
Painter make you fool and there is no way to contact customer care immediately. Now Deep Cleaning Bluff. Every time I book Urban they make customer fool. And the person who has come for cleaning asks me how much money you want. Such a rude behaviour is not acceptable. I am mentally disturbed
So far took one service of Washing machine. So far, fair and excellent.
She is to good thanks sheetal nirula ü§ó
They have pathetic service, they fail to provide service on time even after paying surge charges. And when you complain about the issue they are very well prepared with an excuse. Better go for some local vendors or some other app. There are many service provider like them.
I had a booking today. The person who came for service was named Soma Banerjee. She came and denied waxing service as there was no ac in the room. My point is I have had so many appointments nobody ever said anything about this and had no problem. Today twice the booking got cancelled. What the hell do you guys think of urself? Absolutely ridiculous. You guys are going from bad to worse. I want my money back. Worst service ever. I'll never opt for UC again.
Love the service of urbanclap always...great discounts n coupons by UC. .......would recommend to launch mehendi services too for costumers..
No Changes in Charges... Actually need to pay.more... üëéüëéüëé Uninstalling this stupid app... Its not true... I have this app installed and screenshot taken vefore few months back... Price increased and now discount... üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ You guys are funny
It's very bad . I ordered chocolate roll on waxing but they gave us chocolate waxing which is very disappointing for me . I didn't got what I want which is a very dissatisfiing experience for me
I had an issue with cancellation charges which was resolved. Revising my rating to 5star asy previous rating was based my query for cancellation charges being closed without informing me. The service by the technician itself was 5 star and has been rated so in feedback on the job
Bad cleaning services
A one stop shop for all solutions
I had fevicol stains on my tiles and then tried to get a full home platinum cleaning but the people who came just left out saying they couldn't do it and cancelled the project is this the way professionals work ? Such a waste of company and time
Very bad service
Very good service providers
Gud
Rahul guy had come to our house, he is worst guy. I won't recommend urbonclap with my experience. I decided to not to prefer. Maids are better than these guys. Whatever amount we are paying to urbon clap if we give half of the amount they does good work. So I cancelled booking on spot. It was very inconvenience for us. We thought they will come and clean so we kept all things outside. As he came started telling I will not do this and all. The worst experience I had with this urbanclap.
I am really sorry to say about the service of a.c through this ..as almost all the technicians comes and take the charge and go ..after 3 months again some problem .yesterday after 2 - 3 days taken total 5hrs in two days wasted ...morning technician completed and nite again same problem..around 5000 bill has being raised .. but issue us still the same.
Where is my sign up 100 uc credits. How can you promote such things when you can't provide it. Pathetic it's been 3 days n i m yet to receive my 100 uc credits for signup
Awesome
Pathetic salon at home services. Worst app. Always go to salon
Plz start hair cut service for women in all locations in Kolkata.
2 guys came and cleaned my ac but they stoled my expensive watch worth more than 1 lakh plz do not use this worst app and they all are thief's ,even when I tried to contact customer support it was showing erorr don't call them for any household regarding work....
Simply awesome always.
Bahut hi achcha
Person has done a good job.
The company has matured so much in 5 years and I'm bound to give a better rating as they performed very well..keep up the good work guys!!! üëè
It was a wonderful experience. Jyoti, the beautician arrived absolutely on time and did a wonderful job as per our requirement. She is polite, well behaved. I would like to use her services again. Giving her 5/5 stars
Charge excessively more.Just take advantage of lockdown they put unethical charge
service was very good
Booking process very difficult specially coupon
Bad service
Only there video has professional in it...no professional will come to your home for service and nothing professional about the app and their executive. Call a technician from your neighborhood..much better than this app. My ac body was not cleaned by their technician forget about the area of the mess. Unprofessional
very good
Excellent service
The service was excellent
good services so far
More options not available like sheeting and apartment water piping ,small cement works like bathroom white cement, chemical grouting, drainage pipe leaking lift maintainance , drainage manhole replacement including cement work ,bike repair ,bike puncher , car puncher ,car cleaning
You assigned a professional but he deined taking that booking..its a waste of time.. I lost my 4 hours in waiting.
Waiting for the appointment since past 4hrs, no professional has been assigned yet... #nomoreurbancomapany
It's been 2 weeks since the money got debited and slot not booked. No response from customer services. I already contacted them once. This is highly unprofessional to charge money for the services I didn't get. Please refund my money.
Pathetic service. Not at all punctual. I had booked an appointment 3 days before then also i didn't get my service. I have requested so many times to give call back but no calls. 3 days Continuously i have been waiting but unfortunately no reposnse and finally got a reply that no profesional is available. Being a regular customer of urbanclap i have got such a bad experience. I have never expected this kind of service from urbanclap. I will never ever recommend urbanclap to anyone.
Good service üëç ‚ò∫Ô∏è excellent work üëç
Unable to install.tried multiple times.gets stuck at 83%. Tried reconnecting wifi and ear cache too. nothing works with this app
App works fine but the Service is worst. Added new filters three months back and now it is not working. Today again a technician from urban company came and said that spare parts have to be changed. If I have to buy filters and spare parts every three to four months, then it would cost me more than the purifier.
Awesome
Great service by the person. No issue with how they keep things, not a single thing being troubled at home. Proper outfit, Proper mask, use of sanitizer after cleaning.
Booked salon for women haircut. There is no option to select female professional.they sent a male professional. I had to ask them to reschedule or cancel. Bad customer service. No customer care number.
Worst company ever! Not only their partners didnt make a confirmed appointment, but also they charged me cancellation fee. Rip off
You can add haircut at home for women's also
Expensive
Good.
No service in my area, so why do I see an Ad in Snapchat??
Very poor as we can not contact any executive of uc for any help,This time i booked 2 services ,and they said u will get a call on 27 but yet now I didnt get any call and I am a prime member of it ,if they have this type of behave what with notmal..
Overall bad, received two services through this app, AC servicing and carpet cleaning. 1 Ac is dripping water from inside 2 Carpet is all ruined as it was shiny silver and now it has turned yellow after there cleaning.
Worst service provider... Never ever book any service from them... They are Highly unprofessional... The professional won't pick ur call and after an hour they will cancel ur service... The customer service person won't do anything apart from apologizing... Worst etiquette imparted to employees... HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL AND MANNERLESS PEOPLE in the organisation... Don't waste your time.. go to nearby salon n get service... They have ditched there service for two consecutive days.. NEVER EVER HIRE
I just had two experiences and both of them were very bad and unsatisfactory. Baap ka Raaz chala rakha he . Hope my review will count . I mean there is no shame to this company, again I used their service and happened the same . I wish you all the best for post covid time when no customer will book your service.
Completed job in perfect way with full competency.
Highly unsatisfied with service. Even plumber don't know how to do there work.
WORST APP AND COMPANY SERVICES. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. TEHY DON'T ASSIGN A BEAUTICIAN AT THE TIME OF BOOKING AND SAY IT WILL BE ASSIGNED BEFORE 60 MIN ..THAT ALSO DIDN'T HAPPEN..CUSTOMER CARE LINE IS BUSY EVERYTIME SO YOU CAN'T EVEN COMPLAIN AND TIME RAN OUT. BY THAT I COULD HAVE VISITED THE PARLOR ISTEAD. NO BUSINESSES ETHICS .NOTHING.EXPERIENCED THIS TWICE IN TWO DIFFERENT CITIES.NEVER GOING TO USE THIS.
Some people are paying only visits. They are not able to give solutions
Worst service...... Your streetside technician are even better than these. They even don't have proper tools. They have contact with local technicians and we thought they are professional, they're not. Don't go for it ....... Not recommended.... Rest you are ready to take chance & ready we make your appliances out of order
The customer care services are pathetic for Electrical services .. especially the 30 day service guarantee is a joke ..you try and re raise the request and you won't hear from them again
Good
It's one place for all work.
Very detailed information on this App. Booking of services and subsequent updates are good. Services from UC are excellent.
Excellent
Not yet used
Worst, irresponsible and unproffesional is what i would like to call them. Waste of time and waste of money. Do not pay them in advance before the work is done, they take money, alot u someone and confirms ur booking and no one turns up inspite of repeated calls. The customer service people are just liars committing fake promises and good for nothing. They arent bothered. Lost my money and time. Fake people and useless app. Irritating these people are. No response inspite of payment made
It's a FRAUD, useless technician will visit your home who urban company claim to be professional and that stupid will ask you to contact actual Brand/Company as they are incompetent and not able to fix issue You end up paying visit charge and extra payment for Brand visit It's SCAM
No delivery in my village ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
Worst, pathetic, atrocious service is what these so called proffessionals do.Cheaters they take the money, fix appmnt and allot you a profsnl and sends nobody,inspite of me booking 2 days prior and paid in advance.inspite of talking to custmr care 3times and team leader, they just give fake promises and fake dialogue promising immediate action .Nobody turns up that day and even the next day. Nobody calls back either.I wasted my time, my money and my trust.Not acceptable. No refund,no service
V Good
Very articulate in approach and friendly overall.
Pathetic service! Unprofessional and arrogant service providers!
Nice services
Refuse to clean kitchen draws same was done by other company
Suggestion- please start computer repair facility
Really loved the service.
Its been 3 years there is no professional serving in our area.Everytime I try to book it displays same message again and again that no one is availableat your area..Please try to increase more areas of city for the service .Is there no professional in my area?
Very bad üëé company
Hopeless customer service.. Person denieng service but no proper customer service.. Pls avoid urban company
Worst ac service is provided by them. We booked for water leakage thinking urban company is good brand name but it's a bogus company. There mechanic came twice to resolve the leakage but the issue is not resolved and they charged us 3000rs. Mechanics of urban company's take undue advantage of customer as they are aware customer are not aware of the main cause so they will give any lame excuse and problem is very big we need to change this and that.
nice service and well managed servicrs through the app.
But expensive
No bathrrom cleaning still in vijayawada
Absolutely horrifying and bad parlor services in Lucknow. The area category manager and Sweety Tiwari are highly disrespectful, dishonest and ignorant. Never availing any urban clap service in Lucknow or else where. Will also request others to not depend on urban clap. It'll be a waste of your time and money
Referal code not working, coupon codes not working
I booked for home cleaning servies for yesterday date and the assigned professional told me that his team met with an accident and he would come on next morning and now today, he inforned that he is not going to deliver services. My one complete day was ruined and my all next bookings also got affected which resulted me extra amount. Would Urban company compensate my day, mental agony, my financial loss.Pathetic services app, now onwards no urban company and request to all not to dwld such app
Vgood service
Every time even if paying prepaid money ur staff ask for change of package by saying we donot have that facial that u booked‡•§ U have to take extra bleach. And charge extra I think to go withurban clab is a costly affair And hidden charges are their lack of transparency even I have taken membership but rather than discount it always increase cost I think matter should be looked in for long survival of company. And there should be policy after payment and instructions for staff.
After making full payment of the service, even after paying extra for safety, end of the day they charge more extra money for no reason which nowhere mentioned in time of booking or service. For no reason absolutely they are looting customers in name of safety whereas your executive doesn't take any safety guard while visiting
Repeated requests for ac work after spending several thousands on gas refilling and servicing, they have almost destroyed my proper functioning ac into everyday emerging problems
3 class company
I'm glad and thanks for urban company to give me thi this platform but some problems not solve and it's to much time for m my accident insurance and no responsibility for this üòî
No fakeness, truly saying ..best services I ever seen in india.
No coordination between the painting services and home cleaning services. Please look into in this matters.
Really very good professional services from the technicians of urban company. They adhere to the strict timelines in delivering the service. Keep it up.
Worst service ....
Fantastic experience using UC application. Have been using this app for more than a year now and I have tried different services and all of them so smooth to book. Very professional team and outstanding service.
Excellent
Excellent service by urban team
Excellent service by Mr.Deepak.Thnk you UC..ü§ó
Very Good good good U/C
neat and professional work
As always a perfect service
Excellent
Pathetic app. This is not the first time I'm facing problems with the company. They have absolutely no way of contacting customer care till the time they don't call you back. The professional refused to leave the premises over some payment related issue which I had already clarified with the company rep. I could not use the SOS option as the status was Job completed. There was no way for me contact the company in an emergency like this. Not the first time facing issues with the company.
Meri Baat koi sunvaee nahin karta aur Har Bar Kuchh Na Kuchh Kisi Na Kisi Karan rating Karti rahti hai oriplast time Mere 249 credit - ho gaye hain Aur Main cal curry customer care per to unhone kaha ki aap ko team ki taraf se cal Aaegi uska koi abhi Samadhan Nahin Hua Hai

Good
Limited choice. And costly. Poor in solving problems
Suggestion to all,Please look for other options before booking anything through Urban clap. It's sevices have degraded now.
My money got deducted but no order placed, there is no customer care no. Very pathetic app. Sale chor
Good. Professional service. Satisfied.
Urban company is worth the money used by us for any kind of work. It's better to ask for any work to Urban company rather than paying in high to local workers who even do not work perfectly. Urban company works with perfectionism. Keep it up!
Worst experience for AC repair no one was assigned for us for 3 days
Great experience with urban company
Good
Good
No professionals are getting assigned
Professional at their work.
No customer support and resolution for problems in house painting job..seems like a mistake to trust these guys...
My recent experience for painting is very pathetic, unprofessional & untrained & misfit people. Beware by paying 100% in advance, we don't have any control on quality & timely completion. Staff abruptly stopped the work due to lack of manpower. There is no complaint resolution team to rectify the situation. They call and say apology and disconnect. No solution.
Excellent Experience.
Prathatic guy took my tv and its been 2 weeks my tv has not been returned.
Your professionals are strictly unprofessional, they have the audacity to cancel 2 schedules back to back. Highly unexpected!!!
There is some kind of Tequnician not attend any service on time. Still urban clap is given booking slots. They are taking non sense thinking about our state of levels. Also not well trends if we some reason cancel booking. All frustrations they given to us. I really unhappy with this kind of behavior. Previously I never seen this kind of behavior. Chandraprakash plumber is talking very bad words like apne bhosde me ja teri aaukat nahi booking karne ki and all.
WORST EXEPERINCE EVER SINCE I BOUGHT MY AC . THE MECHANIC WAS IN HURRY AND HE BROKE MY AC PANNEL . NO PROFESSIONALISM AT ALL. THE WATER BAG IS LEAKING WHICH SPOIL MY BED AND WALL PAPER .
Always worst experience. They never provide exact details. Even for aquaguard service they amount charged was ~1k but the service man said 5k.
Very bad service provider company Chet the customer and technician technician ke bartao bahut hora hai har gm any other pe chigon pe char kat rahe te hai help line pe baat karo to company policy batake kese khat karte hai company chahayi technician customer se chit kare aur chi pakda gaya to I'd block kar ke agle seasons mai technician se 25000 lotne ka mauka mil ga 15000 kit ka 10000 mg plain ka
Customer service has gone down drastically...no respect to allotted time, no communication about delays or assignment of technician, technician doesn't call. It is better to have a local contact from electrical shops.
V.good and neat service Worth paying üëå
I have paid for my Ac service for a one year *(Two Services). But the assigned person has refused to work. As it was for my office AC. Even they have not yet returned my amount.
No contact number
Very satisfactory.
This is very bad app when I search for my location this app is unable to do service
This service has gone to dogs. They have expired my wallet money without notice. Can't add multiple services, app doesn't work as expected at times. Guess it's time to delete this
Urban Company FOOLs the clients. A service which is generally offered for 1000, they would make it 1100 and then flash discount offers of 100 . Does it culminate into any discount at all ? This is disregarding the wisdom of clientele . Extremely dissatisfied
super
Very bad work done
Not good,the best they can do after doing blunder is give u refund in your account which should not be the case ,because if they are claiming that they are a responsible organizations this should not happen as a practice Using same brush for every loo Using same brush for millions of bathrooms Wearing torn glovesthat too in one hand And if u complain multiple times they will give u part credit or full credit of ur payment. This is there way of operation of business of hygiene ,very scary
Worst app, I have never seen this type of app, in this app they is no help section or customer care. How can we connect my issues to you....
I wish if i can give them 10 stars, this guys are awesome very professional services, genuine, trustworthy, especially awesome service for introverts like me, no fuss no this that just book and they know all thing's will take care off all requestsüôÇ
Amount deducted from my account but order not yet booked,why we wait 7 days for refund,worst app ,I never see this type of waste app.
It was really a nice experience
Need Kannada speaking person. You cannot assign someone from UP to serve in Bangalore. Need to learn hindi to get service from urban clap in Bangalore so uninstalling app right away and good bye
Very inconvenient as there is no way to contact someone from customer service.
Nice service n easy app
User friendly app. Works well everytime
Amazing go for it üëç
It doesnt deserve even single star...i felt trapped with their ‚≠êrating about their professionalism & punctuality that must be fake..! they kept me waiting arnd 1hr that too for just to estimate the work and its cost in my office...I went there frm arnd 15km for that ,not even informed me about their failure to make it..finally they told me after making rptd calls to postpone it for nxt day...its my 1st order, how can I trust their estimation even thou they did aftr all this mess...?
Plz dont use this app for services like ac repair or anything.They dont have any professional at all. I have asked for ac service thow this app.But now ac is not working.I already have paid 10, 000 rs for repair ac.Still my ac is not working.I have been trying to contact these people.. For past few days. But i have no response. Plz close this app.If i could i would give negative rating.This app dont have any professional.

Bathroom looks like new after cleaning by urban company expert
I have a complaint regarding ur employees..I don't know that why they keep on messaging me for beautician job ..I said that I am not a beautician and pls don't message me but then also they are messaging me ...I am blocking there number and then they are messaging me from a different number....I said them that please stop messaging or else I will raise a complaint but shamelessly they said you do the complaint...pathetic..
Horrible experience.... They sent an immature cleaner who made the house even worst and even after getting a second cleaner from Urban Clap there was no improvement.... And to top it off they took my broom and its been two weeks the customer service just says i will receive it today or tomorrow... When asked for a refund or send another cleaner to which they say its a different issue and they cannot refund thr 94AED i spent on the horrible cleaning.
Good work
The mistry (whom you call professional technician) doesn't attend calls. Uninstalling the app right away. Customer support is bad as well
Why do you take the PPE kit charge when the guy don't wear it you charge for vaccination as well even though its free why do you charge from us
very bad experience with Urban company, all staff and technicians are very unprofessional...you will not get response if any issue occur after servicing...better to go with local vendor...dont rely on urban company..you will feel once any issue occur specially in AC...they dont reaponse on timely....
The person who came to service is good but as promised by Urban company the person is not vaccinated and also not aware of the other person who assisted Amjad. This is an absolute unprofessional attitude from a company like Urban Company.
Very unprofessional, they keep cancelling the booking and even if there is scheduled booking no one will come, then they will inform we are sorry and wastes your time
Good sarvises
bahut hi bakwas compny hai chor hai aap log apna employ ka bara ma nhi soch ta hai
Sunita is one of the best salon service provider of Urbanclap.. Thankyou So happy with Uc..
Don't ever book fron this app.Got me waiting for a whole day.
No vlaue for time
No direct customer care number. Email support is worst. Getting delivery failure for email replies. Took Super saver coupon recently which lapsed before promised number of uses without any notification to users. Did not recommended anyone. Pathetic service.
It was not good experience..I took full home deep cleaning package..but I'm not satisfied with bathroom, toilet cleaning and balcony cleaning.. stains of bathroom tiles, toilet tiles, doors are still there, he don't even clean lights of toilet. Even after highlighting this things to them all are as it is.. the dust on terrace wall is still there.. He broke the lock of one drawer..even after breaking he did not told us.. I strongly not recommend urban company to anyone. I think I wasted my money
The cart can be more extensive. If i want 2 threading . I cnt get it one at a time.
shivani is a good beautician
Very bad service.
after getting Kitchen deep cleaning recently, i have not been given a bill for work done as since i paid cash, i should know that the payment I made has indeed gone to the company's account.
Modarate experience. Not upto the mark.
Nice it really help for each and every thing
Best customer satisfaction üëå
They dont provide the service on scheduled time. I had experienced 2 times and had to cancel bookings
Horrible experience. From 9am to 10, from 10 to 10.30, from 10.30 to 11, from 11 to 12.30. My appointment kept getting rescheduled by your so called " professionals". I am done. Please refund my money
I booked for the setvice for 8am.It was mentioned that the team of 4-5 members will come between 8am to 9am and complete the cleaning in 5 hours. Morning I gets a call asking whether I can postpone. Upon my deniel it was promised to send the team between 8am to 9am. After lot of follow up calls 2 members came by 11:30am. Work was going very slow. After lot of followup another 2 members came by 5:30pm. Remaining all cleaning in hurry burry and completed the work by 9pm compromising quality
Painter did not complete my painting work, no cleaning done. Registered complin few days back. No action taken
We had an Aircon maintenance service recently. The professional was really nice. However, he has identified an issue with one of the aircons and said it needs to be followed up as he's not sure how to solve it. He said urban company will send someone who can help to fix it. When followed up, urban company said they do not do repairs. It seems very unprofessional to offer Aircon maintenance services if you are not able to actually fullfil them.
Too bad experience.....ac is repair for 4 times by mechanic....every tym charged for only 40 rs spare part
Gold wax is really pathetic and I have got bad reactions all over my legs, thighs and hands. I was happy with the service the same day and after that slowly slowly the itching reactions and redness have started. ITS 12.46 AM AND I HAVE NOT SLEPT AS I HAVE TO TAKE A BATH. My whole legs and hands and itching with pain. URBAN SERVICE ARE USING FAKE PRODUCTS AS PER THE RESULTS I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED. Money, time and health everything is taken..Very poor customer service .
Very low skill workforce especially in carpenter catagory. Some crtical activities are avaiable in there list but you will land up with person who has no skills to do that specific work. You might have to pay for his visiting fee inspite of he doing nothing. He will just explain you how critical it is and looking at his confidence level you will not go for it.. Becareful !!!
Awful and horrible service..Once paynent is made they dont care..They spoil tiles and it leaves a mark.. there is a link they send even if you dont rate it allocates a rating you cant edit..They say it is a technical issue that is why ratings are high
Good service clean job
Chetha service thu pagal gallu pani Radhu em Radhu paisal dengude undi Customer care number kuda ledu contact avvadaniki
good
Muskan did an excellent job
very good
app should be update with service providing
Pathetic service. I was charged for just visiting my place. In this case every technician will come and say I won't be able to repair your product, please give my visiting charge. Bloody cheaters.
I have booked 2-3 times for water filter repair. Repair person used to call me and ask details. Later he used to tell, Pls replace motor it will work and disconnect the call. No proper service, Customer support also needs to improve.
Worse worse and worse customer service ever !!! They spoiled my washing machine and never assigned a agent for registration instead they don't care about the customers at all. They are useless!!! I'm so done with this idiotic application . Would not suggest someone to get their appliances repaired by them because they will surely spoil it and won't get it fixed !!!! They are too lazy to care for customer !
Amazing experience
Worst service ever, technician with zero knowledge and experience,they ruined up my split AC which was working fine until they serviced it and post support was even worst they doesn't know how fix the problem at all
Fraud very high amount was charged
Pathetic. Very unprofessional and worthless. Cancellation done at last minute and caused a major inconvenience and headache. I wonder how it's still working. Spoke with the customer care for half an hour and all they could is refund the amount. But what about cancelling at the last moment. I wasted one full day reserving it for you guys to come and finish the service. Deleting the app. It was good before but now no more. No more UC.
Very bed and beheviyar not a treste company #froudcompany
All kind of Good Services are at one place Thank you
Editing again... Lately their services have improved a lot more so I am increasing the rating to 5. I had a chance to interact with one of the persons from urban clap and seldom do employees say so much good about the place, they r working for. So good job
Charged tripple the price mentioned in the price list by adding services unnecessarily
Good service
Best service provided
They are not cleaning as mentioned I don't like urban company service
Excellent
The service providers are good, well trained, well mannered but the quality of products used is not up to the mark. I have used the service several times but my skin retracts to its original state just within a week as compared to salon services that stay for as long as a month. All i can attribute it is to product quality.
WORST ever experience as FIRST time customer ... So many hidden charges in their rate card No value for membership  No cancellation in first one week if not satisfactory  Waste of money I felt  in this
Thank you so much silence service
The professional decides the time slot and not us. Then why do you let us select the time slot! Also they give numerous reasons to not come in dedicated time. Once or twice I can understand but everytime we are facing the same issue.
I have an issue with the latest service booked and I can't contact the customer care of UC. I went all over the app but couldn't get any option.
Good app, good services...
Highly unprofessional and insensitive to customers.Appointment was booked 3 days prior and the assistant called after the scheduled time of appointment to tell she won't be able to come.Its not first time it's usual with urban clap.Customer care executive calls to tell that he is trying to do best but he can't do anything.Do not waste time by booking with them.
Very professional
Gud
Excellent service
Don't use urban company for RO service if you cancel service 70% they loot from customer. Very worst service.
Everything superb
Urban company service is good but not happy with online payment method, changed gateway fees for credit card use. Not allowed to use wallet what you have in app itself. Overall not happy with payment method.
Oh my God. Guys what have you done to the UI of the app. Its so cluttered and not intuitive at all. I have been struggling for minutes to see where my cart. Also if the app hangs or app is closed the cart is deleted. Not the right journey for customer to create cart again and again. You tried to incorporate every feature but this seems not the right way to do it. Please fix
Farod compani
Non committal service.
Instant Respond to complaint nice
Your are not providing services in our locality.
Hi I have recently taken the cleaning service of my sofa and carpet cleaning Even after cleaning the both items smell so badly, he use excessive chemicals on the carpet and sofas both Lodge a re visit request but again it was not done properly, also App still showing the payment is due (a case of double amount charging) Not sure what to do with my high quality furniture it's totally damaged by this company. I use to take sofa cleaning services quarterly Really a bad experience this time .
I have had good experience so far with the professionals sent by them and I can get all my work done by skilled people without any issues.
Worst experience from urban clap if u guys prefer calling yourself professional then act like them. Mere fulfilling there job duties rather actual listening and resolving customer's problems. Paid surge fees of Rs.100 because i want to complete the service today itself but the liberal scheme of urban clap given to their so called professional are very much high, that they don't seem like to give a damn about the job they are paid to get done. Waited and requested your professional assigned for
Good app
Very unprofessional persons are hired.. Not reliable to trust.. Better to hire a nearby known professional..
Good & Excellent üëç
Third class electrician Service...
Great service
Worst experience....they click photo of themselves wearing a faceshied n mask n immediately take the faceshied off.... cleaning done was not appropriate... neither they are wearing gloves as shown in advertisement of urban company...will not refer to anyone
Great cleaning service, I am satisfied. Just one thing to fix, on the app there is no option for cleaning materials.
Excellent service thanks to urban clap
Worst service. Worst part is not to follow-up service Booking.
Wa Ewe zzezerrWEAW w
Great üëç
Not satisfied with service of Urban Company.... Instead of getting proper service to AC; it start making very loud noise..... Didn't pay for service...pay for HEADACHE only....!!!!
Gas hob &cooktop repair not available
Pathetic experience... technicians first charge then think that in which service this repair willcharge this much...no transperancy at all.. not at all worthy..demanding extra payment then bill showing in app..
Superb quality service
I had booked an RO servicing 1 year plan of 2646 rupees . Technician informed to cancel it as they don't provide servicing for my RO . After cancelling they refunded only 281 rupees and they are not contacting anymore, cheat , fraud company
Terrible service..trust me don't choose..
I REALLY LIKE THIS APPLICATION...THIS IS VERY USEFUL. I GAVE 5 STARS
There is no hair cutting service available for women. So disappointed.
I am not just disappointed but appalled by the services offered by your company. I had booked a technician two days ago to repair my fridge, he charged Rs. 1950 for refilling of gas but gave me a bill of 349. When he had come, atleast my freezer worked and now both done. Since then the fridge has been leaking gas. Not only people are passing on the buck to each other, but neither have i received the invoice nor the refund.
I've had the worst experience with Urban Company in the last 55 hours. Yes, that's how long it's taken for you guys to respond to me. I've messaged on the app for callback at least 20 times, mailed about 8 time, messaged on Facebook 5-6 times. All I got was silence or a one-off false assurance. Disgusted with your attitude towards customer complaints and the absolute lack of communication. Please do NOT blame the technician you sent. That's really shallow, he was sincere and did his task.
App is a bit confusing
Pathethic service no respone
Unprofessional and impunctual service offered.
Very bad service of split AC installation. They don't have drill machine for wall cutting. Circle shape cutting machine is required for pipeline pass through wall
Good app for proffesional services
We were very much satisfied and the person who has done the job was excellent
UC outsourced to Maa Tara Cleaning Serv. Supervisor didn't visit, gv remote instructions. Had difficulty removing marks under washing m/c. Difficulty cleaning kitchen. Reluctantly took out chemicals. Lazy team, in 3 hrs cleaned 1 fan, balcony, 1 room & part of kitchen. After lunch, floor cleaning not yet started. Dusting grills. When said what nonsense is this, why are you not using the chemicals. Took offence to "nonsense" and left work midway. Company seeking 2nd chance requested reschedule.
Very poor service. Doing a Scam/Fraud in the name of split AC gas charging. Urban Company technician refilled the gas on 30-03-2021. And then in warranty period of 90 days, i have to call several times but issue not resolved. Now today on 28-07-2021 they are again telling to recharge/refill the gas. Very poor service. AC Technicians come and themselves loose the flare nut so the gas leaks, and then tell to recharge/refill the gas and charge Rs. 2500/-. Its fraud/scam
Tye technician hve to give professional services since one has to provide warranty of his work.üëåüèªüëçüèª Charges are mentioned on menu, one only has to take care that the technician is claiming proper item service cost

Professional, Ontime, Painless
Good experience
They charge more than optimum.
Mr khalid technician for microwave repair had come before the lockdown, the convection is not working since then, he keeps giving reasons to not come, now 90days ate over, what do I do ?
Great work !!
I took a service on 28.07.22 to sanitize my 2BHK and car. The service men courteous and well mannered but the scope of work is not up to my expectations. They spread the liquid all over the flat and asked us to leave it for 2hrs. We had to remove the stains later and that's tedious. I would advice that one can buy a few cans of Savalon surface disinfectant spray for this job. Same with the car too. It will be cheap and effective and less messy.
They are very unprofessional in Bhubaneswar...I booked them for 3 BHK premium cleaning and just 1 hour prior they are saying our professional are busy... absolutely horrible working culture.
While UC is good for services when you don't get people around to attend to your need, the people engaged are not as skilled as others not in UC. Only thing they look to be good at is cleaning. The charges are exorbitant for the job. I got below par service for electricians, multiple times and below par hair cutting. Suggested to use UC only when you don't have othet options
expensive, just fixing a drainage leak cost around 1k, not recommended.
What is the point of giving a customer service number if no one is going to answer? Please look into your customer support services
It helps to have it at hand
Very good service.. never dissatisfies me.
It was nice experience
Charges a lot more than shows initially. Bunch of scam artists.
Excellent
Good service
Nice
I have booked for AC Service. The amount got debited from my account to UC. I dont see it reflected. There is no option for customer support to raise a ticket for refunds
Chor chor chor hai is company mein
No customer care helpline. UC takes 100% advance and simply disappears. You keep raising complaints and thetr will be no call back. Absolutely avoid for high value jobs. You mighy lose all your money.
Third class, They don't care about emergency,
Good
The services are decent, but some flows in the app are flawed. For example, the cashbacks never work. I end up calling the CS to get it resolved every single time. The promo prices are deceptive. Too complicated to be understood. The TP collaborators end up passing the buck to one another. Need to fix these at the earliest. 2021 and still the issues continue.
Ghatiya company
Shivani is good beautician
Not able to contact customer care.its somthing very urgent but not able to get in touch with the company.....I hv requested to arrange a call back but no response
Good
Goodd
Done good job
Very good experience.
Worst parlor service I've ever received. On the top of that, worst customer service not taking proper feedbacks. Not responding back. I did vaxing and I got red rashesh all over the skin. And UC not taking care about this. Worst experience ever
Very impressive service
Everybody is a thief. They go away with parts for repair and then don't even pick up the phone.
Umashwari... She s outstanding... I got a Super massage today....üëçüëçü•∞
Cost effective Good service Polite staffs
worst service. I booked microwave teachnician for repair he came and said that he needs some part will come next day and left microwave open with parts lying around. now its been more than 2 weeks he didn't come. i even registered complaint two times to the company but they just assured me that he will come and one time they said i will get refund but still no response from both technician and helpline people my 348 rs wasted for nothing.
I can't imagine my life without UC services. Especially during Pandemic. Excellent service within minutes !!
poor service
There is no customer or help centre professional to speak to. How do you raise complaints and queries?
Have so far booked 2 services from UC. Massage for my wife and a plumber for home. Both times the service was good. The charges for plumber were similar (approx 10% more) as the one the local rates, but the difference in quality was remarkable. He patiently solved the issue and also have me tips on how to handle certain things to avoid such plumbing problems in future, unlike the local guy who spent 10 mins in all, and the problem recurred in 2 days.
Amazing home cleaning service. They Thoroughly cleanined the house. Excellent work. I will definitely recommend Mr. Arvind Shinde and his Team.
Inefficient mechanics for electronics repair
Worst service.. there customer care number is for name sake... nobody calls you back... all jobs done half way and loot money
Very good
Great experience! More reliable too...
Worst experience ever in customer handling
